        <p><strong>Thoughts of the day</strong></p><p>Since applications like Google Maps launched, determined to find travellers the ‘best’ route for their destination, congestion on otherwise tranquil routes has increased. <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1495267">Other studies</a> suggest that the crowdsourcing aspect of the apps results in “mass thinking,” leading drivers to the same quiet roads until they are no longer quiet. When the best route becomes the one everyone is trying to take, it may no longer be the fastest or the most convenient. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png" width="1456" height="731" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:731,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:138883,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!spBg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f3dcc4-22e7-41b0-8af8-84485cb3b85a_1614x810.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is not an attempt to simplify or demean the sophistication and usefulness of navigation apps; it is to draw a parallel to imagining the trajectory of one’s life. Our tendency to <a href="https://brainfood.substack.com/p/brain-food-849-the-dualities-in-us">think in absolutes</a> can become counterproductive, standing in the way of growth and achievement. The absolute is an obstacle, a form of confirmation bias, of talking oneself out of things.</p><p>The same applies to thinking in absolutes for ‘the way’ in which any project should come to fruition—for example, assuming something should be ready to see the light of day only after countless drafts and revisions, or only after it reaches a specific, and often undefined, form of perfection.</p><p>On writing his autobiographical novel series <em>My Struggle</em>, Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgaard said: </p><blockquote><p><strong>“I learned to lower the threshold; to accept whatever comes; to continue and not to throw away anything; and to do it every day. […] The key is not to think about the writing as good or bad, but to follow your fascination. That is hard, because there’s so much pressure to think of quality and self-presentation; to not appear stupid, or whatever. But the writing itself is easy.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>Echoing Ursula K. Le Guin, who wrote <strong>“There are no rules, except those each individual makes up,” </strong>this is the kind of writing advice that may apply to how a life should be. </p><p>There is no single right way or single right path. Though some paths may be more objectively wrong, even those are not necessarily one-directional. They might also diverge and lead to somewhere unexpected. In seeking the ideal route, we forfeit the rest, forgetting that in life we craft the road as we go along, that there isn’t just one way to lead a good life. Sometimes, the best way to get somewhere may simply be to start.</p><div><hr></div><p>Sometimes we may need to borrow someone else’s eyes to see the good that is in front of </p>...</source>
