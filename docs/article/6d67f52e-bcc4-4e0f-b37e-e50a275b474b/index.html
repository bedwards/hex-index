        <p>Hello, friends.</p><p>Giving thanks should be a year-round practice. I wanted to express my own gratitude to the workers whose stories we’ve covered this past year at Workday Magazine and with our publishing partners, and to my coworkers at the Labor Education Service whose work and passion for talking to working people and challenging injustice inspires me every single day. It’s been a whole year since we relaunched! Time flies.</p><p>Thank you to our readers from me and the team at Workday Magazine and LES, for the conversation, friendship, and solidarity through all kinds of struggle. I know holidays can be a stressful time, on top of stressful news.</p><div><hr></div><p>Since the Hamas-led attack on October 7, the Israeli military’s violence against Palestinian civilians has made life even more unbearable for many. Alongside our community members, we are mourning the killing of Israeli and Palestinian civilians, and overwhelming targeting of civilian infrastructure—including hospitals and homes—in Gaza, antisemitic and Islamophobic speech and actions, and retaliation against those who are speaking out in advocacy, including the <a href="https://www.protect-journalists.com/">journalists</a> in Gaza whose work has put them and their families at incredible risk. Here are some <a href="https://www.workersinpalestine.org/resources">resources</a> for building solidarity with workers in Palestine.</p><p>You can also read and share Sarah’s recent coverage of the labor movement’s solidarity with Palestinian civilians, trade unions, and workers, in collaboration with our publishing partners.</p><p>In <a href="https://workdaymagazine.org/this-union-is-famous-for-opposing-south-african-apartheid-now-its-standing-with-gaza/">This Union Is Famous for Opposing South African Apartheid. Now It’s Standing With Gaza</a>, Larry Wright, a retired dockworker, speaks on a resolution passed in support of Gaza and the history of his union’s struggle against worker exploitation under imperialism and colonialism.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg" width="1456" height="965" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:965,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Qoo3!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb1af8a3a-0b84-4382-838a-085780f830bd_1536x1018.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>The 1984 anti-apartheid boycott at the pier where Nedlloyd Kimberly was anchored.
