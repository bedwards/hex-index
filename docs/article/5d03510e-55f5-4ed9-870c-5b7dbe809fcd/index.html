The book analyzes why Enlightenment culture sparked the Industrial Revolution. Why did the Industrial Revolution take place where it did, and then spread beyond? </p><p>It had to do with a competitive, open market of ideas, Mokyr argues — a transnational “Republic of Letters” — not unlike the crypto ethos of open source, decentralization, and more. We’re sharing the full interview with Mokyr here, covering important themes relevant to the crypto industry and beyond, such as:</p><ul><li><p>going against ancient wisdom, and being able to contest ideas</p></li><li><p>the role of trust, collaboration, and credit in collaboration</p></li><li><p>competitive markets for ideas, elite vs. access in the printing press vs. the internet</p></li><li><p>the role of institutions and emergent organizations</p></li><li><p>2 key ways to drive tech progress</p></li><li><p>how to measure progress when technology is <em>dematerialized</em></p></li><li><p>…and more!</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/joel-mokyr-tech-progress-economic-growth/">read the interview here</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>PROGRESS UPDATES: R&amp;D</strong></p><h2><strong>zkVM Jolt goes from 32-bit to 64-bit proving, and without a slowdown</strong></h2><p><em>Markos Georghiades, Andrew Milson, Justin Thaler, Andrew Tretyakov, Julius Zhang, and Michael Zhu</em></p><p>State of the art <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/lasso-jolt/">zkVM Jolt</a> now proves RISC-V programs using 64-bit registers, rather than just 32-bit ones. And it does so at speeds exceeding those we <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/jolt-6x-speedup/">reported</a> two months ago for 32-bit programs:</p><ul><li><p>Over 500,000 cycles/sec on a MacBook</p></li><li><p>Over 1,500,000 cycles/sec on a 32-core CPU</p></li></ul><p>Why does 64-bit proving ...</p>
