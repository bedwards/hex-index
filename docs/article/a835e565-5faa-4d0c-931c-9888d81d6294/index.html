        <p>Think you’ve lost your capacity to be shocked by stories of Donald Trump’s open corruption? Try this one on for size: The <em>Wall Street Journal </em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/spy-sheikh-secret-stake-trump-crypto-tahnoon-ea4d97e8?st=DdLjND&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">reported</a> this weekend that a UAE sheikh bought a 49 percent stake in the Trump family’s crypto venture World Liberty Financial last year, four days before Trump’s inauguration, with a cool $187 million flowing immediately and directly into Trump-family coffers. Another $31 million went to the family of Steve Witkoff, Trump’s U.S. envoy to the Middle East. <em><strong>Happy Monday</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3242651,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/i/186610028?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aLFo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1fa67b5e-57bb-4795-bcde-0c3ec402301c_5758x3839.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Photo by Jon Putman/Anadolu via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><h1>The Boy Who Cried ‘De-escalation’</h1><p><em>by Andrew Egger</em></p><p>Is ICE “de-escalating?” That was the word on the street last week, as the White House suddenly realized its messaging—<em>our cops are a law to themselves and anyone who disagrees is a terrorist—</em>wasn’t landing so well and began speaking in more neutral tones about ICE’s operations in Minneapolis and elsewhere.</p><p>This was significant. After all, this White House rarely admits any need to change course. But pivoting on messaging is one thing; actually de-escalating ICE operations is another. So far, we’ve seen little evidence of that.</p><p>On Saturday, for instance, we got a <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/30/st-peter-police-chief-intervenes-prevents-federal-agents-from-arresting-resident]">remarkable story</a> out of the small Minnesota town of St. Peter, an hour south of the Twin Cities. A legal observer was driving behind an ICE vehicle and recording them with her dashcam when multiple ICE vehicles boxed her in and forced her to stop. Video then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG7bqoDJ9L4&amp;t=23s">shows</a> multiple ICE agents piling out of their car, immediately drawing their guns, pointing them at the observer, and screaming at her to “get out of the car.”</p><p>When the observer refused, the agents dragged her from her vehicle, put her into one of theirs, and began driving her back toward the Twin Cities, the woman later <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/30/st-peter-police-chief-intervenes-prevents-federal-agents-from-arresting-resident">told MPR News</a>, before appearing to change their minds and dropping her instead at the St. Peter police station.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a><strong> </strong>The chief of police then gave her a ride home in his squad car.</p><p>“He started talking to me like he just couldn’t [believe] how terrible it was, what was happening,” the woman said. “And he was so sorry and so scared for me and that type of thing, and [he] was so upset by what they’re doing to our community.”</p><p>Naturally, the Department of Homeland Security had its own take on events. In multiple social-media posts Saturday, DHS <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2017753980672049479">called</a> </p>...</source>
