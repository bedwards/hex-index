        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with a quote from John Green&#039;s &#039;The Fault in Our Stars&#039; about falling in love slowly then all at once - a metaphor the author uses to frame their journey into teaching. Readers would benefit from learning about Green&#039;s background as both a bestselling YA author and former chaplain/teacher, connecting to the article&#039;s themes of meaningful connection with young people.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis is that the author discovered teaching through play - from daycare to camp counseling to clown auditions. The psychology and developmental science of play, including how it facilitates learning and social bonding, directly underpins the author&#039;s intuitive discovery that &#039;we played, we laughed, and we learned.&#039;</p>
