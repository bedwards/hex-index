        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with a quote from John Green&#039;s &#039;The Fault in Our Stars&#039; about falling in love slowly then all at once - a metaphor the author uses to frame their journey into teaching. Readers would benefit from learning about Green&#039;s background as both a bestselling YA author and former chaplain/teacher, connecting to the article&#039;s themes of meaningful connection with young people.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis is that the author discovered teaching through play - from daycare to camp counseling to clown auditions. The psychology and developmental science of play, including how it facilitates learning and social bonding, directly underpins the author&#039;s intuitive discovery that &#039;we played, we laughed, and we learned.&#039;</p>

My mom ran a daycare center out of our suburban home. We had cribs, playpens, plastic toys, and Fisher-Price furniture spread throughout the house. Weekdays, working parents would drop their babies off early before rush hour traffic. If I wasn’t awake, dressed, and out of my bedroom by 6:00 AM, my mother was kicking me out to put a baby down for their morning nap. Once my door closed, my bedroom was no longer my own; off limits.</p><p>I learned to change diapers before I learned to drive. When I got home from school, it was my job to gather the sleepy-eyed napping babies, change their diapers, and play until pickup. For years, I was eager to come home from school and be joyfully ambushed by kids. Hide-and-seek. Horsey. Coloring books. Snack time. Simon Says. Duck, duck, goose. My afternoons were filled with laughter before I retreated to my bedroom to do homework. There is nothing like the dopamine rush I would get when making those little ones laugh. I watched babies grow from drooling and babbling to toddling and talking. When some toddlers aged into preschool, more babies were introduced to our little daycare family. At 16, however, I wanted a <em>paying</em> job, so I naturally when looking for something where I could continue working with children.</p><p>My first serious job was working summers at <a href="https://clubgreenwood.com/programs/camp-greenwood/">Camp Greenwood</a>, a daycare and sports camp attached to an athletic center. I worked my way up from games and crafts to coaching, lifeguarding, and eventually, planning field trips as the head counselor. The closer I got to graduating high school, though, the greater the pressure was to attend college, decide on a major, and start preparing for my future career. I knew that I loved making kids laugh, but I couldn’t be a professional camp counselor or run a daycare. Teachers worked with children, but I wasn’t a very good student. I didn’t like school. Learning was hard and my classes were boring. You have to be smart to be a teacher. I loved playing with kids, and making them laugh, but that didn’t fit with my school experiences.
