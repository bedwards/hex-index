        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references Schmitt&#039;s political theory about sovereignty and emergency powers, citing his influence on figures like Peter Thiel and Curtis Yarvin. Understanding Schmitt&#039;s controversial ideas about &#039;the exception&#039; and sovereign power provides crucial context for the article&#039;s constitutional arguments.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly mentions this law as central to the constitutional debate over executive power and Congress&#039;s power of the purse. Most readers likely don&#039;t know the Nixon-era origins of this legislation or its specific mechanisms.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article describes how Republicans used budget reconciliation to pass major legislation without Democratic votes. This procedural mechanism has become increasingly important in American politics, but its specific rules and history are not widely understood.</p>

        <p>The hallmark of the first year of President Donald J. Trump’s second term has been the attempt of the president and his cronies to dismantle the constitutional system set up by the framers of that document when they established the United States of America. It’s not simply that they have broken the laws. They have acted as if the laws, and the Constitution that underpins them, don’t exist.</p><p>As soon as the 2024 election results were clear, billionaire Elon Musk, who had supported Trump’s campaign both through his purchase of Twitter—now X—and with $290 million in cash, posted on social media: “Novus Ordo Seclorum,” Latin for “New World Order.” Although he won with less than 50% of the vote, Trump announced that he had an “unprecedented and powerful mandate.” Musk would head a new “Department of Government Efficiency” that Musk vowed would cut at least $2 trillion from the federal budget.</p><p>Musk and his operatives muscled their way into government offices and gained access to computer systems. With strokes of a keyboard they eliminated jobs and programs, including, as Musk put it, feeding “into the wood chipper” most of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government agency aimed at combating disease and malnutrition around the globe. That dismantling has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, recently concluded that while the Department of Government Efficiency did not actually reduce spending, it did cut almost 10% of federal employees, a key goal of Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025.</p><p>And, crucially, it put operatives in virtually all government departments and agencies, where they gained access to privileged information about Americans, including citizens, legal residents, and undocumented immigrants.</p><p>Musk and DOGE also established the idea that the unelected officials in the Trump administration could do whatever they wished, without regard to the laws or the Constitution. The Constitution, judicial precedent, and the 1974 Impoundment Control Act all make it very clear that the power of the purse belongs to Congress. As the elected representatives of the American people, only members of the House of Representatives and the Senate can determine how the nation’s money is spent. Then the president must “take Care that the laws be faithfully executed.”</p><p>Democrats objected to the administration’s dramatic usurpation of the power of Congress, but Republicans did not ...</p>
