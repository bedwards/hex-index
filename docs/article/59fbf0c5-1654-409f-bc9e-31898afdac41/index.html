        <p>Lots of monopoly related news, as usual. Google is now emailing children to tell them how to avoid parental controls, a price war brought down the price of weight loss drugs, there’s cool innovation by Lego toys, and the Trump administration actually blocked a merger!</p><p>Before getting to that, let’s focus on how Trump is managing the problem of affordability and politics. Over the past week, we got a clearer idea how this administration will set itself up for the midterm elections. The President announced attempts to crack down on credit card companies, big landlords, and defense contractors, and his administration is now pursuing a high-profile criminal investigation of the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell. The moves are all happening, more or less, because of an increasing panic in the White House over high prices, as the President sees that the public is unhappy with his performance. </p><p>In short, a key political theme of the next year for the Trump administration and the Democratic opposition is affordability, with a lot of rhetoric of cracking down on wayward corporations. Will it work? Is it sincere? That’s the lens I’m going to use in looking at the events of the past week. </p><p>To answer these questions, I’ll observe another less noticed move last week that I find more significant. The Justice Department waived through a multi-billion real estate brokerage merger in what looks like a corrupt deal to create a home buying monopoly. Though few noticed this deal, it is one of many below-the-radar choices that will likely raise consumer costs. There is, in other words, tension between the announced agenda and the real one. </p><h3>From Make America Wealthy Again to Affordability</h3><p>Ok, let’s start with the political context. The theme of the President’s domestic economic policy in his first year was not affordability, it was, in Trump’s words, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiTFPN6SZsU&amp;t=3s">Make America Wealthy Again</a>.

The elections of 2025, when Democrats romped, and Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won a shocking upset in New York City, show that this agenda hasn’t delivered politically.
