      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>The term “true threats” refers to a subcategory of threats outside the protection of the First Amendment.  Not all threats are “true,” and therefore not all threats fall outside of the First Amendment.   <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/394/705">For more than half a century</a>, courts have used a (purportedly) objective standard to determine whether a threat is true, asking whether a reasonable person, familiar with the context, would interpret the threat as a sincere expression of intent to do harm.  <a href="https://popehat.substack.com/p/true-threats-and-american-cultural">As I’ve argued before, the so-called “objective standard” can be very difficult to administer in this big diverse messy country where we often don’t share a common sense of reality</a> and there is no uniform “reasonable person.”</p><p>But for many years, American courts have disagreed on whether there is <em>also </em>a <em>subjective</em> element to the definition of “true threats,” and if so, what it requires.  Put another way, does the First Amendment require that the government prove that a speaker <em>intended</em> that their statement be taken as a threat, or at least that they were reckless or negligent about whether it would by taken that way?  Courts have reached different conclusions.  As recently as 2015 the Supreme Court has <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/575/13-983/">punted rather than resolve the dispute.</a>  Now, finally, the Court has resolved the question:  the First Amendment requires that, at a minimum, the government prove that a speaker was <em>reckless</em> about whether their statement would be interpreted as threatening.</p><p>The case is <em>Counterman v. Colorado, </em>decided today.  Counterman sent numerous unwelcome social media messages to a local musician.  She reasonably interpreted the entirety of the communications in general, and some of them in particular, to be frightening, and withdrew from public life.  Charged with stalking under a Colorado state law, Counterman argued that he lacked subjectively threatening intent — not a completely implausible defense, since he seems quite mentally ill.  He was found guilty at trial, and the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting Counterman’s argument that the jury should have been required to find that he had some wrongful intent that his statements be taken as threats.   </p><div class="file-embed-wrapper" data-component-name="FileToDOM"><div class="file-embed-container-reader"><div class="file-embed-container-top"><img class="file-embed-thumbnail-default" src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0Cy0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Fattachment_icon.svg"><div class="file-embed-details"><div class="file-embed-details-h1">Counterman</div><div class="file-embed-details-h2">305KB ∙ PDF file</div></div><a class="file-embed-button wide" href="https://popehat.substack.com/api/v1/file/87667384-b443-49c2-9d65-defdb1961b95.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div><a class="file-embed-button narrow" href="https://popehat.substack.com/api/v1/file/87667384-b443-49c2-9d65-defdb1961b95.pdf"><span class="file-embed-button-text">Download</span></a></div></div><p>A divided Supreme Court reversed.
