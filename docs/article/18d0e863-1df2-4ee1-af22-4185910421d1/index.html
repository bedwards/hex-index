A working group of former JAGs, that is, members of the military’s legal branch, issued a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/former-jag-working-group-no-quarter-statement.pdf">statement</a> declaring that it</p><blockquote><p>unanimously considers both the giving and the execution of these orders, if true, to constitute war crimes, murder, or both.</p></blockquote><p>On the other side, Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/world/americas/trump-pardon-honduras-hernandez.html">declared his intention</a> to grant “a Full and Complete Pardon” to Juan Orlando Hernández, a former president of Honduras who has been convicted of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.<strong> </strong>In fact, Hernandez was part of a cartel, including his brother, that smuggled hundreds of tons of cocaine into this country.</p><p>At first glance, the juxtaposition seems bizarre – Trump is either murdering or committing war crimes against people who are at worst small-time drug smugglers, and may be innocent fishermen, while pardoning a drug lord who was responsible for thousands of American deaths while savaging his own country, Honduras. But there is a pattern to this murderous madness, once one connects the dots between Trump’s mob-boss persona and the billionaire crypto/tech broligarchy.</p><p>First, understand that Trump’s vendetta against purported penny-ante drug smugglers is all about dominance display, an exhibition of his ability to order violence. The real object may be to set the stage for invadingVenezuela.</p><p>Second, while Trump is clearly willing to inflict gratuitous suffering on the little people, he positively revels in his association with big-time criminals, whether it’s Putin; or Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who had a critical journalist <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/saudi-arabia/un-investigator-trumps-defense-saudi-crown-prince-jamal-khashoggi-rcna244757">dismembered with a bone saw</a>; or Ross Ulbricht, creator of Silk Road, an underground e-marketplace known for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/21/nx-s1-5270051/trump-pardons-dark-web-marketplace-creator-ross-ulbricht">drug trafficking</a>, whom Trump pardoned immediately after assuming office; or Larry Hoover, a Chicago crime boss, who was sentenced to several lifetimes in prison for leading the Gangster Disciples, also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5415939/trump-pardons-drug-kingpins-even-as-he-escalates-the-u-s-drug-war">pardoned by Trump</a>. Yes, Trump really and truly cares about crime in Chicago.</p><p>Still, why would Trump, whose <a href="https://fiftyplusone.news/polls/approval/president">poll numbers</a> are cratering, generate even more negative headlines by pardoning Hernández, who was duly convicted of conspiring to send more than <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/juan-orlando-hernandez-former-president-honduras-sentenced-45-years-prison-conspiring">400 tons</a> (!) of cocaine to America?</p><p>The answer is the influence of the crypto/tech broligarchy. In fact, many of Trump’s </p>...</source>
