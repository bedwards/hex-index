        <p>Dear Subscribers,</p><p>I’ll be taking a break from Substack until September. Thank you for being here with me. The joyous struggle continues, but I will not be in your inboxes for a while. After that last post on <em><a href="https://jonathanrowson.substack.com/p/rain-and-the-rhinoceros">Rain and the Rhinoceros</a>,</em> it hit me that I need to be less like a rhinoceros and more like a monk in a cabin in the woods. </p><p>I see thinking-in-action through writing as a kind of spectator sport, but it’s also part of my job and vocation. From a cursory glance, it looks like I have written 36 posts here since June 2024, and another 6 over on <a href="https://perspecteeva.substack.com/">Perspectiva </a>(do sign up now if you haven’t), which means 3-4 posts every month, and most of them, hopefully, are not too shabby.</p><p>While there are times to <a href="https://jonathanrowson.substack.com/p/keep-going">keep going</a>, there are also times to stop.

It does not look too fancy, but Nick tells me it was carefully chosen, and I could feel that. If I had known I was going to write about it, I would have taken a photo and noted the name of the beans, but you’ll have to use your imagination. What I can say is that it requires an appropriate amount of maintenance, and I never minded looking after it. When the lights flashed and the pouring wouldn’t start, I saw the machine like a crying infant that probably had a legitimate need.<br><br>I was on site for a whole week, and I became so familiar with this source of stimulation that I began to identify with it, and to wonder what it might be like to be a coffee machine. I was even reminded of the Flann O’Brien novel about people becoming their bicycles. If you don’t know the comic (and ...</p>
