From having reinvented and redefined one of the most basic yet crucial aspects of women’s clothing, to dealing with the highs and lows that come in business. She has persevered through it all and come out the other side victorious, successful and happy with her life.</p><p>Her progress and ability to remain at the top of her game for over twenty years is what makes her stand out from the crowd. Yet, if you had to point at one particular aspect of what makes her different, that would be her formidable ability to drive change.

She realised you do not have to be the most experienced person in the field to redefine it. All you need to know is how to operate in a niche most effectively and uniquely, because quite often the people who are already making something similar may not have a unique knowledge required to disrupt that market time and again.</p><h2>Developing your idea</h2><p>As cliche, repetitive and naive this statement may sound, Sara believes the one question you must ask yourself when starting your business is,</p><blockquote><p><code>What are you going to make that will change the world?</code></p></blockquote><p>While this question can be intimidating, the solution often is not.
