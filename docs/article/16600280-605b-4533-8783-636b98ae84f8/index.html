        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Mandel&#039;s introduction to Capital Vol. 2 and his analysis of productive vs unproductive labor. Understanding his broader intellectual contributions to Marxist economics and his role in Trotskyism would deepen comprehension of the theoretical debates presented.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The entire article hinges on Marx&#039;s distinction between productive labor (that which produces surplus value) and unproductive labor.

        <p class="topic-summary">Engels&#039;s letter mentions concerns about publishing Capital Vol. 3 under the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany. Understanding this historical context of censorship and repression of socialist ideas illuminates why the &#039;purely scientific&#039; nature of Vol. 2 was seen as advantageous for publication.</p>
