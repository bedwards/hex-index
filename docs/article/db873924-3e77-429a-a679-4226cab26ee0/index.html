        <p class="topic-summary">Understanding IMEI numbers is crucial context for why stolen phones can still be valuable despite being &#039;locked&#039; - they can be re-flashed or sold to markets where IMEI blacklists aren&#039;t enforced. This explains the technical side of why phone theft remains profitable.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s secondary story about the Kingston artwork specifically references this 16th-century Flemish painter as inspiration. Readers would benefit from understanding Bruegel&#039;s distinctive style of crowded, fantastical scenes to evaluate whether the artwork is AI-generated or intentionally Bosch/Bruegel-inspired.</p>

After checking Sam had nothing else on him, they started to run off.</p><p>What happened next was a surprise.

Suddenly his Samsung Galaxy was lifted from his hand by a young man on the bike.</p><p>“I didn’t realise what happened immediately but as soon as I did, I went after him.” But with little chance of catching the thief on foot, Mark ultimately gave up — only to be amazed by what happened next: “I saw him stop, look at my phone, then throw it on the floor. He cycled off and I retrieved my phone.”</p><p>As the thief didn’t throw it with force there was “no damage”, he said. </p><p>That is, other than the harm caused to Mark’s ego: “If anything I feel a bit rejected.
