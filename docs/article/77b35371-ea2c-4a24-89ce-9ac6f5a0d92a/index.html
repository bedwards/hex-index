        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references the rise of the hippie trail as the transformative force that turned Kheerganga from a pilgrimage route into a tourist destination. Understanding this historical phenomenon of overland travel from Europe to South Asia provides crucial context for why Western backpackers and psytrance culture converged on the Parvati Valley.</p>

If you focus on a single point, such as a green-roofed house or a particularly notable tree, you can actually see the shadow moving, so rapid is the sunrise here. I am waiting for my next meeting to begin and am in the meantime working through my emails. I have just returned from a trek to Kheerganga and my legs, particularly my knees, are on fire. The things we do for our writing.</p><p>It has been slow going on the writing front since I arrived in India two weeks ago. I am still getting used to the pre-dawn starts, especially here in the chill of the mountains. While finishing work at lunchtime is a blessing, the impulse is to walk around and explore, not to hole up somewhere with a notebook, even when, as in these parts, there is almost nothing else to do.

Although I have been taking a lot of notes, I hadn’t, until this past weekend, had any real idea where they fit, or how to start turning them into something useful.</p><p>Going to Kheerganga, then, proved necessary in more ways than one.</p><p>We started at Pulga Dam on Saturday morning.
