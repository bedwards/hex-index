He escalated tensions with Venezuela; his angry primetime address reeked of not only lies but pure desperation; and the “renaming” of the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center was just embarrassing. Heard of the saying, ‘Wag the dog’?!</p><p>On the other hand, it was, after all, another pretty standard – and troubling – week for the US under Trump 2.0. Trump lied, made racist edicts, challenged laws, and attacked press freedom. Republicans ensured millions of Americans would go into the new year with astronomically higher health insurance premiums. And while the DOJ  did release thousands of Epstein documents, as <strong><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/trump-epstein-files-cover-up-released-documents-clinton">Zeteo’s </a></strong><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/trump-epstein-files-cover-up-released-documents-clinton">political team noted</a>, in not releasing all the files, Trump is continuing his Epstein cover-up. </p><p>From moving to ban gender-affirming care for minors to dramatically increasing efforts to strip citizenship of naturalized Americans to filing a ridiculous $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC, here’s what Trump and his allies did this week to harm democracy, hurt Americans and free societies worldwide, and undermine the Constitution:</p><h3><strong>Saturday, December 13</strong></h3><ul><li><p>A gunman killed two people and injured nine others in a <a href="https://projects.browndailyherald.com/2025/12/16/timeline/">mass shooting</a> at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
