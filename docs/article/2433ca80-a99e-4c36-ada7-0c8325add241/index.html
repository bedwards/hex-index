      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I belong to a real book club that really exists in real life. It is composed of my actual friends. We meet maybe four to six times per year, and it’s always a great time. Usually our books are picked by Dustin, who keeps a list of interesting books. But for our latest selection I lobbied hard for <em>Flesh</em>, because I knew both Celine Nguyen and Henry Oliver <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-172209924">liked</a> <a href="https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/boys-flesh-christie-hours-trollope">it</a>.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>And I enjoyed the book. It rewarded the few hours I spent reading it. I did not think, “God what a waste of time.” That was a nice feeling. I hardly ever pick up a newly-released novel just for fun. Earlier this year, I read Ocean Vuong’s book because I thought it would be fun to write about. <a href="https://arcmag.org/adichies-american-blues/">I also reviewed Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie’s </a><em><a href="https://arcmag.org/adichies-american-blues/">Dream Count</a></em>, which I did not like, although I think she’s a very good writer.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Vincenzo Latronico’s <em>Perfection</em> was the last contemporary book I read that I truly enjoyed, and that was six months ago.</p><p>Anyway now that <em>Flesh </em>has won the Booker Prize, I felt like I should write about it. This novel is not horrendous. When I started reading this book—the first chapter is about some kid in Budapest being seduced by an older woman—I was like what is this? What am I reading? This is so flat! I do not want to read 400 pages of this.</p><blockquote><p>One day she suggests that they sit on the sofa. </p><p>He has never been in her living room. He doesn’t really take it in, except that there’s a balcony at one end, like there is in his mother’s apartment, with a balustrade made of panels of green safety glass. </p><p>They sit on the sofa.</p></blockquote><p>But then a lot of exciting stuff happens. Actual events! It’s so shocking when I am reading a contemporary literary book, and then things happen. Like, major life events. And then different things happen. And it’s all related in this very flat tone, but the protagonist himself is not emotionless. He has desires. He just doesn’t really verbalize those desires or conceptualize them in various ways. It’s a very interesting performance on Szalay’s part. I appreciated the artistry and enjoyed reading the book. The Booker Prize was well-deserved!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png" width="1456" height="150" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/df9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:150,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:37150,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.woman-of-letters.com/i/179108968?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!DevS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf9bd417-ea4d-4dff-9527-4ec82dbe67bc_1456x150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h4>The Buzzy Literary Novel</h4><p>When I was trying to describe to my friends why they should pick <em>Flesh </em>for </p>...</source>
