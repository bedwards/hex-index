This legislation fundamentally changed public sector unions in Wisconsin and serves as a key case study in the education policy debate discussed.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article cites a study titled &#039;Rent-Seeking through collective bargaining&#039; but doesn&#039;t explain the economic concept. Understanding rent-seeking behavior illuminates the critique of how unions may influence education spending in ways that don&#039;t benefit students.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, we teed up two questions related to teacher salaries. First, what’s the argument for and against paying teachers more instead of spending education dollars on other things? Second, if we want additional funding to translate into higher teacher pay, should reformers focus state advocacy on teacher compensation instead of school finance reform?</p><p>We’ll save the second question for next week, but see below for great comments about the first from Matt Barnum, Kevin Carey, Susie Miller Carello, David Griffith, and Stéphane Lavertu. Plus, we round up recent posts from the edu-sphere, including Nina Rees on her time working for Dick Cheney and Jed Wallace on the impact of Tuesday’s elections on charter schools.</p><p>Warning: This is a long one!</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox on Tuesday and Friday mornings.

That would mean allowing class sizes to rise modestly, but also means doing without so many collateral staff, such as instructional aides, literacy coaches, tutors, and mental health counselors.</p><p>Yet few schools—in any sector—prioritize their budgets in this manner. Why is that?</p><p>As several respondents argue, schools may be responding to consumer demand. They are giving parents what they want.</p><p>On Bluesky, <strong>Matt Barnum</strong> noted:</p><blockquote><p>The same trend (greater investment in people than salaries) shows up in private schools. For better or worse, this may reflect schools’ response to what parents want.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Carey</strong> said much the same:</p><blockquote><p>The expensive private schools that rich people send their kids to are full of moderate-salary teachers in very small classes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Matt</strong> agreed:</p><blockquote><p>Exactly, and many schools of choice actively market their small classes/staffing ratios. This trend appears to be a market response—which doesn’t necessarily mean it’s optimal!—as much as anything else.</p></blockquote><p>It makes sense. While parents might <a href="https://pdkpoll.org/2025-poll-results/">tell pollsters</a> that <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/most-americans-support-raising-teacher-pay-but-theres-a-partisan-rift/2022/08">they think teachers should be paid more</a>, when it comes to their own kids’ schools, salaries are invisible while class sizes and extra services are all too apparent.
