In fact, those are just the leaders listed on the department website. The office actually has 29 full-time employees.</em></p><h3 id="fraud-at-austin-energy">Fraud at Austin Energy</h3><p>The big news today is a City Auditor report about a former Austin Energy employee who defrauded the utility of nearly $1 million: </p><blockquote>Between fiscal years 2018 and 2023, we found that Ybarra paid fictitious vendors around $980,000 using his purchasing card. During this period, he paid at least 30 vendors through his purchasing card. Of these 30 vendors, only eight appear to be registered City vendors.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Good stuff. You can read <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Auditor/Audit_Reports/Investigations/InvestigationReport_Austin_Energy_Fraud_Waste_December2025.pdf?ref=austinpolitics.net" rel="noreferrer">the whole report</a> here. </p><p>As you might imagine, some view this as evidence that the city needs a third-party audit. But another conclusion would be that the city should simply invest more in its in-house auditing team. </p><h3 id="rich-people-problems"><strong>Rich people problems </strong></h3><p>For its house-hunting series, "The Hunt," the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/12/04/realestate/palm-springs-rancho-mirage-california-homes.html?ref=austinpolitics.net" rel="noreferrer">New York Times</a> interviewed a couple that recently relocated from a 4-bedroom house in Barton Springs to Palm Springs, Calif: </p><blockquote>They thought about moving to Tucson, Ariz., or back to California. “We were not liking either climate in Texas — political or weather,” Mr. Barenholtz said. “We were spending more time at our lake house in Northern Michigan in the spring and fall along with the summer, and yet <strong>our electric bill in Austin was $2,000 a month in summer, even when we weren’t there.”</strong></blockquote><p>A reader alerted me to the story and asked: <em>Is this hyperbolic, or does this really happen to some people? Did they leave their AC on at 65 and have a big pool that they chilled ice cold while they were away?&nbsp;</em></p><p>The reader, who lives in a 1,700 square foot home in Central Austin with a partner and two kids, only paid $97 for electricity in July and $215 for the total utility bill. </p><p>The number was stunning to me too. The entire bill for our three-person household was consistently under $200, even in the hellish summer of 2023. Granted our house was barely 1,000 sq ft, we didn't water our grass and my wife's preferred indoor temperature is well above average. </p><p>But then I talked to a friend who has a family of four in an enormous house in West Austin with a pool.
