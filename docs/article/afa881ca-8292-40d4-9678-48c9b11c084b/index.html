      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Dollar Tree (DLTR) held its <a href="https://corporate.dollartree.com/investors/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/11190/2025-investor-day">2025 Investor Day</a>.</p><p>Given that DLTR is my largest position – <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/p/q3-2025-portfolio-update">and by a meaningful margin</a> – I want to share a few key takeaways. As always, I’d encourage you to revisit <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/t/dltr">prior TSOH research on the company</a> for a fuller understanding of my views here, including how they’ve evolved over time. That historic perspective provides useful context for my current views on Dollar Tree’s business and stock.</p><p>As a reminder, Dollar Tree last held an Investor Day <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/p/dollar-tree-turning-point">in June 2023</a>. One thing that stood out about the previous Investor Day was the sequencing of the presentations: after opening remarks from <a href="https://corporate.dollartree.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/272/dollar-tree-announces-leadership-transition-and-reaffirms">then CEO Richard Dreiling</a>, the focus shifted to Family Dollar’s (FDO’s) turnaround efforts, as opposed to the compelling long-term opportunities at Dollar Tree. To put that in context, the price tag on the Family Dollar sale <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/dollar-tree-to-sell-family-dollar-business-for-1-billion-eb3e6aa4?msockid=1c302391d69563690da33083d70562fb">in March</a> was $1 billion, or about one-twentieth of the market cap currently ascribed to Dollar Tree by Mr. Market. To me, that exemplifies the distraction and misallocation of resources as a result of the Family Dollar acquisition; the path forward is now much clearer.</p>
