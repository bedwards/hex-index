      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Two weeks ago, I hosted<em> <a href="https://www.pragmaticsummit.com/">The Pragmatic Summit</a></em> in San Francisco, a few days after attending a 50-person workshop entitled <em>The Future of Software Development </em>in Deer Valley, Utah. Each event attracted experienced software engineers, leaders, and deep thinkers to share thoughts about the state of the software engineering industry today and in the future.</p><p><strong>It was well-timed, considering that right now seems like a period of change for tech that’s unfolding faster than before.</strong> That was a consensus opinion at both events, also held by veterans like Martin Fowler and Kent Beck, who said things haven’t shifted so rapidly during their 50+ years in the industry.</p><p>At the very start of this year, I predicted <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what">AI will write almost all code, going forward</a>, and several others have <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/183694080/1-latest-models-create-a-ha-moments">said</a> the same. But at the Pragmatic Summit, I met an embedded engineer writing Assembly and C code who is still writing more of his code by hand than with AI agents – and was the only person I spoke with in San Fran who was not yet “giving in” to AI agents.</p><p>Even so, today, this engineer has between a third and a half of their own low-level code being generated by AI agents since the launch of Opus 4.5, and this share keeps on rising. Their view was an interesting counterpoint to the prevailing trend.</p><p>This article shares some thought-provoking ideas and conversations from both events, covering:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Data vs hype: how orgs actually win with AI. </strong>Laura Tacho’s keynote at The Pragmatic Summit. Exclusive data reveals 92% of devs use AI coding tools monthly (!!), “unhealthy” orgs see 2x more incidents, healthy ones have 50% more, and other new data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Building world-class engineering orgs in the AI era.</strong> The closing session of the summit dug into what AI-native teams look like, in a fireside chat with GitHub’s former CEO and the CTO of Atlassian.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>The Future of Software Development</strong></em><strong> with Martin Fowler. </strong>Laura Tacho, distinguished engineer Annie Vella, Martin Fowler, and myself, look back on the event in Utah. Nobody has the AI shift all worked out, which is reassuring!</p></li><li><p><strong>Mid-level engineers’ quiet crisis. </strong>Something I heard that engineering leaders talk about behind closed doors a lot is that mid-career engineers are being left behind by the AI wave. New grads are more productive with the tools, while seniors have more of that all-important experience. Advice on how to </p></li>...</ol>
