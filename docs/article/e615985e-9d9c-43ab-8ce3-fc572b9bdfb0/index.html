        <p>In Jason Pargin’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Starting-Worry-About-This-Black/dp/1250879981">I’m Starting To Worry About This Black Box Of Doom</a></em>, a manic pixie dream girl cajoles a shut-in incel loser to drive her and her mysterious box cross-country. The further they drive, the more evidence starts to build that she is a terrorist and her box is a nuke. As our protagonist becomes increasingly desperate to turn around and return to his comfortable world of social media feeds and psych meds, she pleads with him to come out of his shell, learn to trust people offline, and have a sense of adventure. The book’s dramatic tension comes from our simultaneously rooting for his character development and worrying that it might be a ruse to manipulate him into blowing up Washington, DC.</p><p>This book is not shy about its moral, delivered in approximately one soliloquy per state by our author mouthpiece character (the girl).

Or the “black box” of fear that the algorithms trap us in, where we feel like the world is “doomed” and there’s nothing we can do. She urges us to break out of our boxes and feel optimism about the state of society. Quote below, Ether is the girl, Abbott is the loser, and he’s just ventured the opinion that it’s unethical to have children in a world as doomed and dystopian as ours:</p><blockquote><p>“My grandfather,” continued Ether, “who I basically never talk to anymore, one hundred percent believes Christ is going to return to earth at any minute to bring about the apocalypse, due to mankind’s sinfulness. He believes everything he watches on the news is a sign: encroaching Communism, the Satanic conspiracy to allow gays to marry, race-mixing, debauchery, pornography, drag queens, the QAnon child sex cult, the climate change ‘hoax’ he says has fooled the world. He has a TV on every minute he’s awake, tuned to these ultra-right-wing news outlets ranting about depravity.”</p><p>“I know old guys like that,” said Abbott. “My dad works with a couple. They’re nuts. You can’t even talk to them.”</p><p>“So we can agree that, purely via the carefully filtered media a person consumes, they can come to fully believe in an apocalypse that </p>...</blockquote>
