Gen. Roman Gofman to run the Mossad is his latest desperate move to surround himself with loyalists over professionals in the security realm. (Times of Israel)</figcaption></figure></div><p>First it was Shin Bet. </p><p>And now the Mossad will soon have a new, partisan head—and that’s not good news for the already fragile and flawed Israeli democracy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision to appoint Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, his military secretary, as the 14th head of the nation’s elite foreign espionage agency is a continuation of his politicization and takeover of the entire intelligence community. It is also an expression of no confidence in the Mossad’s 7,000 employees, among whom Netanyahu did not find anyone worthy of leading the organization. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>In that sense, Netanyahu is following in Donald Trump’s footsteps by appointing his own loyalists. But unlike in the United States—where senior appointments have long been tied to personal and partisan considerations—the Israeli tradition is that the heads of the intelligence agencies serve the state rather than its leader, and remain in office even when a prime minister is replaced by a political rival. From 1976 until Trump arrived in Washington, the FBI’s director had a 10-year term as well, and the CIA was led by intelligence professionals. Now they, too, are rank partisans.</p><p>Gofman is expected to assume the position in about six months, when the current Mossad chief, David (“Dadi”) Barnea, completes his five-year term.</p><p>The new appointment also contains a measure of disrespect toward Barnea, who asked Netanyahu to appoint someone from within the organization and recommended two candidates, whose names cannot be revealed publicly under Israeli law.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic" width="1095" height="744" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:744,&quot;width&quot;:1095,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:86317,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.spytalk.co/i/181097825?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GB0M!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83bcf509-a4ec-4272-a3ca-033e89e174f5_1095x744.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Gofman with Netanyahu in a helicopter (photo by Maayan Toaf GPO/TPS-IL, Dec. 4, 2025) </figcaption></figure></div><p>This is not the first time an outsider has been appointed to head the Mossad. There have already been five such appointments since 1963. The last outsider was IDF General Meir Dagan, a legendary counterterrorism soldier, who was chosen in 2002 by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to lead the agency. In that case as well, Sharon, too, was accused of promoting a close associate. (Dagan had been his 2001 campaign manager.)</p><p>And yet, there is a major difference between then and now. Over the years, the Mossad —like the domestic security service Shin Bet—underwent a gradual transformation from agencies serving the political leadership of the ruling left wing government, which ruled Israel from 1948 </p></source>...</source>
