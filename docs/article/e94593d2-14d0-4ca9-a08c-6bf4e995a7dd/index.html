I have put every ounce of faith in the fact that, life will bring me the lemons I need to sip on the cool, sweet reward of refreshing lemonade. ‘What is for me, will not go by me’, I will repeat, everyday, a mantra whispered from my lips, imprinted daily in the pages of my journal. I commit to this belief religiously with as much conviction as my mother breathlessly reciting the rosary at mass. </p><p>I given full credence to this belief, in some ways it offers respite when things don’t go my way. If I didn’t get that job, well it was not for me, that relationship didn’t work out, well that’s not for me either. I value this belief because it’s an easy way to learn to let go of the things, no matter how much they hurt and batter your ego. Put trust and faith in the fact that, whatever it was you thought you desired was not actually meant to align with your life in that specific moment. Putting meaning into things like that just makes it easier to leave it all behind because in the end, it was really just out of your hands. It is a refined skill to let go without resistance and with full acceptance.</p><p>But like most things, we need balance. Balance because, while things may not work out for us at some points in time, we need to remember to be active when crafting the life we envision. I am not a zealot when it comes to manifesting but knowing where you’d like to aim the arrow of your life towards is <em>empowering.</em> And learning to let go of the things that don’t work out along the way only sharpens your vision, everything that will distract you inevitably falls by the wayside. </p></source>
