What does he cost?’ I don’t think there’s a number that exists,” he said about his beloved Australian Shepherd, Crosby. “Would I sell him for, like, $10 million? I absolutely would not. The entire reason for having $10 million would be to take Crosby on a boat to Europe or something like that.”</p><p>Crosby is Oren’s best friend. (Like all other pet owners mentioned in this story, Oren asked that he and his dog be referred to by pseudonyms.) “It’s such a singular relationship,” he says. Crosby has severe separation anxiety, so Oren and his partner can’t leave him alone for more than ninety minutes at a time unless they arrange for a sitter or daycare. Their dynamic is not dissimilar to that of parent and child. Crosby “has just completely upended our social life,” Oren says. And like any attentive parents, they’re attached to their baby. “I prioritize things I can do socially where I can bring Crosby too,” he says. Crosby comes to barbecues and park hangs and is a tail-wagging fixture at their neighbourhood wine bar in the summer.</p><p>In my friend group of thirtysomething yuppies, most are married, and many have kids. An eavesdropper on our dinner conversation probably couldn’t say for certain whether we’re talking about Beagles or babies. At least not from the way we discuss these pooches’ personalities and prescriptions, or trade tales of digestive disasters. An obsession with one’s pet was once a hallmark trait of eccentric sitcom characters. But if the question “Who rescued who?” used to induce eye rolls and forced smiles, today, it elicits earnest nods of recognition. Dog owners have become the kind of people we used to make fun of: pet parents.</p><p>People were humanizing their pets even before the pandemic adoption boom, with owners pampering their pooches with massages, hotel stays, and gourmet food. But the trend has intensified, shifting the relationship to a new emotional register—from pet ownership to pet parenthood. Today, “pet parent” is a social identity worthy of marquee status in an Instagram bio or a Hinge profile—and a new consumer group fuelling a growing market expected to surpass half </p>...</source>
