        <p>Before I start writing about all the other stuff I saw at the Sydney Film Festival, I have to point out that watching all of Jafar Panahi’s films in one fell swoop—except for <em>Crimson Gold</em>, which I’d seen before—was one of the great cinematic experiences of my life.</p><p>It wasn’t that Panahi was present in Sydney, though that was obviously a nice touch. (After Israel and Iran went to war, he didn’t rock up to screenings anymore. He did run a masterclass on the festival’s last day, but he was mostly in his hotel room, trying to contact people back home.) I had in any case met him before, in Brisbane in 2003, when <em>Crimson Gold</em> played there. He also doesn’t speak a lick of English so it’s not as though we would have been able to talk about much.</p><p>But to see, over two weeks, the entirety of his oeuvre—and to witness just how much it changes after he was thrown in prison and banned from filmmaking—was a wonderful experience. I don’t think you could say with any great honesty that he’s not one of the most important filmmakers working today. There may be better, but I do not know many who are more important, except, for those we’ve never heard from, because they, too, have been prevented from making movies. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg" width="856" height="482" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:482,&quot;width&quot;:856,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:123824,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://matthewclayfield.substack.com/i/165630589?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3i1m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcc1eb1d-6225-4e9a-a5f2-e1882ddf389b_856x482.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Mirror</em> (Panahi, 1997)</figcaption></figure></div><p>His filmography can be broken into two distinct phases (though I suspect it’s currently entering a third). There are the films he made when he was allowed to make films and there are the films he made after he was not. The two phases share a lot in common—particularly their meta, extra-cinematic qualities, which are on display as early as <em>Mirror</em>, when, halfway through the film, the child actor looks into the camera and Panahi yells cut—but the vibe of them changes, becoming angrier over time. His first two films, <em>The White Balloon </em>and <em>Mirror</em>, are films about children, which take an innocent-seeming, feel-good approach that effectively allows him to explore Iranian society—especially its feelings about women, and to a slightly lesser extent about money—on the sly without getting him into too much trouble. By the time he gets to his third, <em>The Circle</em>, he’s no longer pulling punches. That film follows various women who have recently escaped or been released from prison, where all of them have been placed on </p>...</source>
