        <p>This week, Fox News came for me. They published <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-reposts-viral-video-calling-jingle-bells-racist-christmas-carol-faces-new-scrutiny">an article</a> lambasting my work, posted it across their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSJA-NdgZ1C/">social media</a> accounts, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIArd_jizZU">convened a panel</a> of hosts to discuss it on live television. The subject? <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSAcebUjsQ6/">A video</a> I made about the origins of “Jingle Bells” in blackface minstrelsy which has racked up millions of views and tens of thousands of comments. </p><p>This right-wing backlash was sparked when former MSNBC host Joy Reid shared my video to her 1.3 million <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joyannreid/">Instagram</a> followers. Fox’s response, framed as opposition to Joy Reid’s repost of my content, has since reached millions and also driven mass engagement.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png" width="1456" height="815" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5924092,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://historycanthide.substack.com/i/181427821?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jW7g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa2571e8b-abed-471d-9a6d-32b84180b92f_3646x2042.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I read through those comments, and though impossible to confirm, I’d bet 99.99% of the responses do not engage with the historical research at all. Instead, they attack a straw man, a version of my argument that exists only in their headlines. The whole fiasco reveals exactly how propaganda works, and how <strong>anti-intellectualism has become a reflex</strong> for millions of Americans.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>I’m fighting to document hidden histories like this one before conservatives can bully academics and intellectuals into submission.</em></p><p><em>With no corporate backing or wealthy sponsors, this work depends entirely on readers like you. </em></p><p><em>If everyone reading this became a paid subscriber, I could investigate these stories full-time, but right now, less than 4% of my followers are paid subscribers. </em></p><p><em>If you believe in journalism that pulls back the curtain on the songs we’ve been singing our whole lives, please consider a paid subscription today.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>The Pavlovian Response</h2><p>Scroll through the comments on Fox’s posts, and you will find a remarkably consistent pattern:</p><blockquote><p>“A true racist will find racism in everything.” </p><p>“We know that the people who keep saying racist, are the real racists!” </p><p>“Good grief! What isn’t racist to that woman???” </p><p>“Let’s stop making her relevant.”</p></blockquote><p>These are conditioned responses, not counterarguments. Like Pavlov’s dogs salivating at a bell, these commenters have been trained to attack the moment they hear that something, anything, has been called racist. Millions of people have been so thoroughly conditioned that they will reject documented historical facts without a moment’s investigation, and instead let pundits do their thinking for them.</p><p>Whether the claim is true, or the evidence is overwhelming, none of that matters. The word itself triggers the response, and the response is always the same: deny, deny, deny.</p><p>Honestly, it’s more sad than anything else. These are people so brainwashed, </p>...</source>
