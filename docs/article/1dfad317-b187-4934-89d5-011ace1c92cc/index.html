        <p>Thank you, subscribers, <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/just-answering-questions-the-fall">for your thoughtful questions</a>! I answered most and tried to address the main points of the rest. I’ve also done <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtTWKV5NqPk">two recent interviews</a> on the Mark Thompson Show that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUO7DyQfIQ&amp;t=1181s">answer even more questions</a>. (Click on the underlined links.)</p><p>Finally: <strong>Please sign up to get this newsletter in your inbox</strong>! Email is the most reliable distribution method in the oligarch algorithm era, so if you’d like to hear from me, sign up — it’s free! If you’d like to offer financial support — and get the perk of submitting a question for the next Q &amp; A — please do so here:</p><p><strong>Mary:</strong> What are you doing about research now that the internet is so broken? <strong>Tracy: </strong>Do you have suggestions for how we the people can archive information before it disappears?</p><p><strong>SK: </strong>The loss of working search engines and easy access to information is a tremendous crisis for researchers, especially when <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/soul-stripping">coupled with AI</a>. Here are some suggestions. First, all AI content needs to be labeled as such. Second, we need far more curation, including preservation of digital-only works. Third, anyone who can make their website free should do so. I am a lone writer in Missouri, and I keep my work free, yet millionaire media groups claim they can’t. As a result, we end up with a slew of paywalled “Here’s the <em>only</em> way to save democracy” articles with the “answer” blocked. People pay to bypass the wall and land in a gated community of Stepford Pundits. These pseudo-resisters prey on fear for profit: they are the regriftance.</p><p>The war on information is a war on the future by way of destroying the past: especially the recent past. I worry that the history of the first quarter of the 21<sup>st</sup> century will be annihilated. When I <a href="http://www.sarahkendziorbooks.com">look back on my books</a>, I know I could never uncover all that corruption today — partly because search engines are broken; partly because media is censored or outlets have gone under. My end notes have become dead ends.</p><p>I encourage folks to print out articles, make copies as Word docs, save them on <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> — anything. Hopefully there will be a more organized preservation movement in the future. Given the enormous amount of vital digital information out there, every effort helps, even if it’s not public yet. Someday a writer may post ...</p>
