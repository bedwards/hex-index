          <strong>Great Game</strong>
          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references the &#039;Great Game&#039; as a British invention and 19th century imperial obsession about Russia threatening India. Understanding this historical rivalry between the British and Russian Empires in Central Asia provides crucial context for the article&#039;s argument about recurring patterns of inflated Russian threat perceptions.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references the Napoleonic Wars and &#039;French Europe&#039;s invasion of Russia&#039; as an example of Russia being invaded rather than being the invader. This 1812 campaign is central to understanding Russian defensive historical consciousness and Tolstoy&#039;s War and Peace, both mentioned in the article.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Kollontai appears in the article&#039;s key terms and was a pioneering Soviet diplomat who served as ambassador to Sweden. Her diplomatic career offers a historical counterpoint to claims of Russian diplomatic aggression, showing Russia&#039;s capacity for conventional diplomatic engagement.</p>

Britain, NATO, Ukraine and the world, she said, were harassed by “the menace of an aggressive, expansionist and revisionist Russia.” “Putin’s Russia” was the spider at the centre of an “interlocking web of security challenges – military, technological, social, ethical even.” This spectre haunting NATO’s strategists threatened more than physical invasion by Russian tanks.</p><blockquote><p>Our world is more dangerous and contested now than it has been for decades. Conflict is evolving and trust eroding, just as new technologies spur both competition and dependence. We are being contested from sea to space, from the battlefield to the boardroom. And even our brains, as disinformation manipulates our understanding of each other and ourselves. . . . We are now operating in a space between peace and war.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-blaise-metreweli-chief-of-sis-15-december-2025">Speech by Blaise Metreweli</a>, Chief of SIS, 15 December 2025</p></blockquote><p>Her artfully articulated fears were more than lurid propaganda. They were the chiselled certainties of the NATO doctrine of permanent attrition war - <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/themindness/p/weaponizing-time-elite-anxiety-and?r=azb1g&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">as brilliantly analysed by Nel Bonilla</a> - not just in physical reality, but the psychological warfare of our minds.</p><blockquote><p>The export of chaos is a feature not a bug in this Russian approach to international engagement; and we should be ready for this to continue until Putin is forced to change his calculus.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-blaise-metreweli-chief-of-sis-15-december-2025">Speech by Blaise Metreweli</a>, Chief of SIS, 15 December 2025</p></blockquote><p>Does their history make Russians seek peace or war? </p><p>The Black Legend of Russian History presents Russia as ...</p>
