As Hal Press from NRD outlines below, The Merge is not a “trade” - it is a long-term investment that will be influenced heavily by a structural shift in ETH flows as well as many things I’ve outlined previously in <a href="https://thedailygwei.substack.com/p/you-dont-own-enough-eth-the-daily">this post</a>.</p><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/NorthRockLP/status/1548547184609689600&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I think people misunderstand what the Merge represents sometimes.

This means we are really just 2 months away from Ethereum becoming a full Proof of Stake network and newly issued ETH dropping by about 80-90%. And as Hal notes above, this is a structural shift in the flows of ETH as an asset - we are going from millions of dollars worth of freshly mined ETH being force-sold each day to basically 0 sell pressure (since withdrawals of staked ETH and rewards aren’t enabled at time of The Merge).</p><p>Given these facts, Hal is right to say that this isn’t a trade and that a long-term investment horizon should be taken when buying ETH. I mean, I’ve personally been buying ETH since basically day 1 in anticipation of a Proof of Stake Ethereum and I also <a href="https://medium.com/ethhub/why-ether-is-valuable-2b4e39e01eb3">wrote about</a> the issuance reduction that was coming all the way back in January of 2019. Obviously it’s taken a lot longer for Ethereum to transition to Proof of Stake than we’ve all been led to believe, but it really is just around the corner this time.</p><p>There are many ways people are trying to get exposure to ‘The Merge trade’ such as just buying ETH itself, buying staked ETH tokens (stETH, rETH), buying governance tokens for staking services (RPL, LDO, SWISE) and even buying competitor layer 1 tokens as a “hedge” against some sort of “failed merge”. I’ve even seen people saying that they’re buying ETC (Ethereum Classic) because all the miners </p>...</source>
