        <h3>“All your sorrows have been wasted on you if you have not yet learned how to be wretched.”</h3>
<hr>
<p><em>“Grief, when it comes, is nothing like we expect it to be,”</em> Joan Didion observed in her <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/12/05/joan-didion-on-grief/">classic meditation on loss</a>. Abraham Lincoln, in his moving <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/24/abraham-lincoln-fanny-mccullough-consolation-letter/">letter of consolation to a grief-stricken young woman</a>, wrote of how time transmutes grief into “a sad sweet feeling in your heart.” But what, exactly, is the mechanism of that transmutation and how do we master it before it masters us when grief descends in one of its unforeseeable guises? </p>
<p>Long before Didion, before Lincoln, another titan of thought — the great Roman philosopher <strong>Lucius Annaeus Seneca</strong> — addressed this in what might be the crowning achievement in <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/03/13/letters-of-consolation/">the canon of consolation letters</a>, folding into his missive an elegant summation of Stoicism’s core tenets of resilience. </p>
<p>In the year 41, Seneca was sentenced to exile on the Mediterranean island of Corsica for an alleged affair with the emperor’s sister. Sometime in the next eighteen months, he penned one of his most extraordinary works — a letter of consolation to his mother, Helvia. </p>
<p>Helvia was a woman whose life had been marked by unimaginable loss — her own mother had died while giving birth to her, and she outlived her husband, her beloved uncle, and three of her grandchildren. Twenty days after one the grandchildren — Seneca’s own son — died in her arms, Helvia received news that Seneca had been taken away to Corsica, doomed to life in exile. This final misfortune, Seneca suggests, sent the lifelong tower of losses toppling over and crushing the old woman with grief, prompting him in turn to write <em>Consolation to Helvia</em>, included in his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dialogues-Letters-Penguin-Classics-Seneca/dp/0140446796/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Dialogues and Letters</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/dialogues-and-letters/oclc/781421560&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>
<p>Although the piece belongs in the ancient genre of <em>consolatio</em> dating back to the fifth century B.C. — a literary tradition of essay-like letters written to comfort bereaved loved ones — what makes Seneca’s missive unusual is the very paradox that lends it its power: The person whose misfortune is being grieved is also the consoler of the griever.</p>
