As Stephen and Elizabeth grow from precocious children into neurotic artists in their thirties, Matthew Gasda reveals how post-industrial, late 20th century America created a generation too intelligent for ordinary happiness, too self-aware for decisive action: suspended between the working-class pragmatism of their fathers and the creative and spiritual aspirations of their mothers, capable of everything except building lives.</em></p><p><em>Matthew Gasda is the founder of the <a href="https://brooklyncenterfortheatreresearch.com/">Brooklyn Center for Theater Research</a> and the author of many books, including the recent novel <a href="https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781648211263/the-sleepers/">The Sleepers</a> and <a href="https://asterismbooks.com/product/writers-diary-matthew-gasda">Writer’s Diary</a>.</em></p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p>The next morning, Adele took Elizabeth with her to her parents’ place in Allentown, leaving Stephen at home with his father, who was working on a new stone patio in the backyard.
