        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday.

The planned 230,000 square-foot plant is the healthcare company’s latest step in a 10-year plan to modernize and expand its distribution network. Pharmaceutical distribution remains Cardinal’s most lucrative business, and it is continuing to gain customers. Cardinal aims to enhance the efficiency and versatility of its pharmaceutical and specialty distribution business, which handles over 70,000 drug deliveries daily. Drug companies require more specialized storage and shipping services from companies like Cardinal, as they increasingly sell complex drugs, such as cell and gene therapies.

General Mills stated that it anticipates the actions will result in approximately $82 million of restructuring charges, comprising roughly $64 million of asset write-offs and $18 million of other costs, including severance.

The corridor will leverage Greenlane’s existing flagship station in Colton, California, enabling long-haul electric truck charging. The site features 40 high-speed chargers, 12 pull-through lanes, and 29 bobtail lanes for medium-heavy-duty EVs. Electric trucking carrier Nevoya is one of Greenlane’s first customers as part of a pilot program with Windrose Technology. Nevoya will use the Windrose R700 electric truck as part of the pilot.
