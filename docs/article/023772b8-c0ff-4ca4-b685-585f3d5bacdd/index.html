Terry and his group became synonymous with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/11/24/operation-rescues-mission-to-save-itself/1e85a059-e51b-494d-94fe-1ac4a2b5ea45/">protests against abortion</a>, often forming human blockades at clinics to keep people out until police inevitably arrived to drag protesters away.</p><p>These sit-ins and blockades mostly came to an end in 1994 with the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. The legislation made it a federal crime to block entrances and also made anyone who did so subject to federal lawsuits. President Trump’s Justice Department, however, is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-face-act-abortion-related-actions-justice-department/">no longer prosecuting</a> FACE cases except under “extraordinary” circumstances. Trump also <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-grants-president-donald-j-trump-2025-present">pardoned</a> 23 people convicted of FACE violations.</p><p>So now Terry is helping lead blockades again, this time with a coalition of groups such as the <a href="https://paaunow.org/">Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising</a>. They call their movement “Operation Resurrection.” In the video above, Ford Fischer of News2Share films their inaugural blockade of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Memphis and a training session in which Terry repeatedly spoke of the need to bring back Operation Rescue — a group that, by the way, has <a href="https://www.operationrescue.org/noblog/three-statements-concerning-randall-terrys-unbiblical-lawsuit-against-troy-newman/">made clear</a> it’s no longer associated with him. </p>
