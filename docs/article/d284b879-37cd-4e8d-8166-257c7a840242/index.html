        <p><em>Happy Thanksgiving! TSOH Investment Research will be off on Thursday for the holiday, but I’ll be back Monday, December 1st, with an update on <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/t/airbnb">Airbnb</a>.</em></p><p>From “<strong><a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/p/disney-the-turning-point-revisited">The Turning Point, Revisited</a></strong>” (November 2024): “With the launch of ESPN DTC flagship, and with proper alignment of the strategy across the DTC apps / the U.S. Disney bundle and more aggressive negotiations with (v)MVPD’s that reflect the essential content that Disney supplies, I think they will start to do a better job at fending off the pressure from more expensive sports rights. After six-plus years of a largely defensive strategy that did not address the core ESPN issue, Disney is shifting to an offensive posture...”</p><p>At the stroke of midnight on <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/youtube-tv-blackout-loses-abc-espn-disney-networks-1236566477/">October 30th</a>, Disney’s U.S. TV channels went dark on YouTube TV, the leading vMVPD with a subscriber base estimated at roughly 10 million households (not accounting for what I suspect is millions of users who are taking advantage of <a href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7129768?sjid=16811466666199929184-NA">loose password sharing restrictions</a>). The stalemate lasted more than two weeks, with a resolution on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-and-youtube-tv-reach-deal-ending-15-day-standoff-34625df0?msockid=1c302391d69563690da33083d70562fb">November 14th</a>.</p><p>This is the second Disney carriage dispute I’ve covered at TSOH, with the first being the Charter blackout <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/p/moving-forward-or-moving-on">in late 2023</a>. I won’t rehash that discussion, but it’s important to note that Charter was primarily focused on packaging flexibility, including customer access to Disney’s DTC apps; the dispute wasn’t centered on a disagreement about affiliate fees / pricing (<a href="https://research.alpha-sense.com?docid=ET-19609-1854397017&amp;utm_source=alphasense%20platform&amp;utm_medium=document%20share&amp;utm_content=ET-19609-1854397017&amp;utm_campaign=1763562021176">Charter CEO Chris Winfrey</a>: “we agreed to Disney’s supposed market rate increases”).</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-and-youtube-tv-reach-deal-ending-15-day-standoff-34625df0?msockid=1c302391d69563690da33083d70562fb">WSJ reporting</a>, the YouTube TV negotiations primarily stalled on pricing - “the fees Disney was seeking to carry ESPN and other networks”. If so, I think Disney’s negotiating position was clear: <strong>hold firm </strong>(I think that’s the right answer even before considering <a href="https://www.cato.org/regulation/fall-2024/mfn-clauses-tv-programming">MFN clauses</a> with other distributors). </p><p>My view is Disney’s position as the leading supplier of marquee U.S. sports rights has greatly improved <a href="https://x.com/TSOH_Investing/status/1991144541315875088?s=20">its </a><em><a href="https://x.com/TSOH_Investing/status/1991144541315875088?s=20">relative</a></em><a href="https://x.com/TSOH_Investing/status/1991144541315875088?s=20"> importance</a> as the U.S. pay-TV audience shrank from ~85 million households five years ago to ~60 million today; they are the most important content provider, and they need to aggressively defend their economics (as shown on <a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/the_walt_disney_company/SEC/sec-show.aspx?FilingId=18917086&amp;Cik=0001744489&amp;Type=PDF&amp;hasPdf=1">page 44 of the 10-K</a>, ESPN’s domestic programming and production costs were up 8% in FY25).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg" width="915" height="667" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:667,&quot;width&quot;:915,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:87521,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://thescienceofhitting.com/i/179356291?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!muCU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc5dc599-d1fe-4fbe-a0a3-04370ab4d846_915x667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>While this wasn’t true for many years - <a href="https://thescienceofhitting.com/p/disney-a-new-era">the ESPN+ diversion</a> - Disney is now in a position where their business can be <strong>truly indifferent</strong> </p>...</source>
