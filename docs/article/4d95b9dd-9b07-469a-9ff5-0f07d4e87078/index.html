        <p><em>Before we continue with this week’s edition of Synapse, I want to apologize for missing your inbox last Sunday. I needed a break and gave myself permission to take a Sunday off. It’s been a tough year for a lot of us and I encourage each of you to cut yourself some slack. I’ve got some interesting content planned for the next few weeks. Thanks in advance for your support!</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg" width="1456" height="1352" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1352,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1637955,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XlbY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F84b64b15-01d7-45ae-a3a9-864acabcfc71_3235x3005.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In <a href="https://synapse.substack.com/p/toward-a-quest-of-understanding">Toward a Quest of Understanding</a>, I discussed the virtue of using neuroscience and to better understand human nature in an effort to become more compassionate and understanding human beings. Jonathan Haidt’s The Righteous Mind is a book helps me work toward that end and this week I want to share another important tidbit I’ve learned: <strong>that even though WEIRD people (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic) are statistical outliers in the global population, they are often the subject of research in the social sciences. </strong>The result of this is a tempting erroneous conclusion that WEIRD morality is the “correct” morality. </p><p>For example, many psychological studies are conducted on college students because they are located at the same place that these studies are being conducted and are easy to find/recruit. One moral tenant emphasized on many college campuses—especially secular ones—is the <strong>harm principle</strong> which was popularized by John Stuart Mill and others and states <strong>that the only reason anyone should exercise power in a society is to prevent harm. </strong></p><p>In other words, moral judgements shouldn’t be extended as long as there isn’t harm done to any person. </p><p>Yet, when we venture out into non-WEIRD societies, we find that <strong>there is more to morality than harm and fairness. </strong>For example, most people would claim that incest is immoral without appealing to any claim of harm. “Incest is just wrong. Period.” </p><p>Decades of social science research summarized by Haidt have actually found <strong>three </strong>types of ethics across WEIRD and non-WEIRD societies: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Ethic of Autonomy: </strong>The concept that people have their own unique wants and needs and that people have a right to pursue those wants and needs given that they aren’t harming others. This is the foundational ethic of secular, western societies. </p></li><li><p><strong>Ethic of Community: </strong>The concept that individuals are first part of a group—family, city, nation, etc—and then an individual. Concepts such as duty and hierarchy are more pronounced in this ethic. Many non-western societies value the ethic of community more </p></li></ol>...</source>
