In our new <em>Strength In Numbers/</em>Verasight<em> </em>poll, 54% of voters said the Democratic Party doesn’t get people like them — and 55% said the same about the Republicans. Nearly a quarter said <em>both </em>parties are out of touch, and only a third of voters told us they are happy with their current choice of political parties. Today, most voters say that <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/new-poll-dems-lead-house-generic">a major third party</a> is necessary to get the country back on track. </p><p>While general anti-party sentiment is growing, Democratic strategists and center-left pundits are engaged in a fierce debate over whether to move the party’s “brand” and policy positions substantially to the right as a way to appeal to more moderate voters. Republicans will soon face similar soul-searching efforts, addressing the question of what the party looks like after Donald Trump is gone.</p><p>To address the questions from all of these groups, we need data. It’s obvious that Americans broadly want something new from their political leaders, but “something new” is not a policy platform or ideology. In order to start a successful third party — or to meaningfully change the brand of one of the major ones — <strong>we have to know what, exactly, voters actually want from their leaders</strong>. We need clean, clear, hard data.</p><p>Many analysts try to approximate an answer to these question by first looking the<a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/the-strategists-fallacy?r=a9pj&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web"> policies that are popular</a> with voters, or by <a href="https://echeloninsights.com/in-the-news/june-2025-political-quadrants/">forcing voters to pick</a> one of several pre-determined party platforms. Then, they use that data to infer the policy positions a party should take, and the messaging strategy it should use, in order to win the next election. They use their data, in other words, as a way to back in to an analysis of the thing they actually care about&nbsp;— as proxy for answering the question “What should my party campaign on to win the next election?”</p><p>These approaches can be useful, and are often cool from a data (esp. visualization) perspective. However, they suffer from two problems. First, the use of proxy variables (asking voters “do you favor this?” to answer the question “would you vote for a party that campaigns on this?”) introduces many ...</p>
