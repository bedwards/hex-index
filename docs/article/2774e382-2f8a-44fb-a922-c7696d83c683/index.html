My mission is to offer an independent platform for accessible journalism that raises awareness and empowers understanding.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>If you share this vision, please consider supporting my work by becoming a <a href="https://www.sportspolitika.news/subscribe">paid subscriber</a>. </strong></em></p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>On his first day back in office on January 20, 2025, Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders at a makeshift desk set up in the middle of the Capital One Arena, home to the Washington Wizards NBA team and the Washington Capitals hockey team. <br> <br>With each executive action signed, Trump would pause for dramatic effect before holding up the signature before the estimated 20,000 supporters, who roared and cheered in approval.

He has reasserted federal control over college athletics and revived the Cold War-era Presidential Fitness Test. And he has launched a White House task force on the 2026 FIFA World Cup and another task force for the 2028 Olympic Summer Games in Los Angeles. <br><br>This level of presidential engagement matters because it fuses Trump’s cultural instincts with his MAGA agenda to make America great again. Where past presidents used sports for ceremonial appearances or soft diplomacy, Trump turns them into battlegrounds in the culture wars.</p><p>By tying federal education funding to sex-at-birth athletic rules, appointing professional wrestling executives to national fitness councils, or showcasing World Cup trophies in the Oval Office, he transforms sports policy into a vessel for his political messaging.</p><p>The spectacle of sports – </p>...</source>
