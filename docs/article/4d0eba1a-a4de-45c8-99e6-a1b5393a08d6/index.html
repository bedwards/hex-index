        <p><em>Friends, Yesterday and today, I watched many hours of the CDC’s meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). In case you forgot, ACIP votes determine our national vaccine strategies. By law, vaccines recommended in its adopted resolutions must be covered by private insurance. (They also largely guide whether public programs will cover them.) Because the stakes are so high, Secretary Kennedy unilaterally fired every single expert on the committee this summer, replacing them with hand-picked replacements. Many of Secretary Kennedy’s new voting members understand neither the science nor the process by which this work is supposed to proceed—which I assume was the point.</em></p><p><em>Below are some thoughts from having jumped on the grenade to watch all of this for you. There are also incredibly good resources from <a href="https://www.evicollective.org">The Evidence Collective</a>, a group with which I am affiliated. They did a superb job covering FAQs from this meeting.
