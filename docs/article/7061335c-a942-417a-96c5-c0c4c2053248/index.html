Perhaps I am a big kid, forever ten years old. Given my affinity with children, my original plan was to become a Kindergarten teacher (or <a href="https://adrianneibauer.substack.com/i/177094417/clown-college">professional clown</a>). I feel comfortable around children; playing games, making messes, and laughing all come natural to me. As I grew into adulthood, I learned that I have an exceptional talent for soothing a crying baby and calming down a tantruming toddler. When my own children aged out of elementary school, my wife had a much easier time relating to them than I did. When they were pushing for adult independence and more responsibility, I was trying to baby them. My wife loves seeing our children grow into little adults. Meanwhile, I keep looking at photo albums, nostalgically recollecting the days when my children were little. I miss changing diapers and playing horsey. Yes, I can (and do) still comfort my teens when they are stressed or hurt, but it isn’t the same as kissing a boo-boo. </p><p>My family accuses me of being overly sentimental. The truth is that I love my children and am constantly in awe watching them navigate either high school or the <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/an-open-letter-to-my-son?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">Marine Corps</a> with a maturity I lacked at their age. I do admit there is something special when my middle son roasts me with a perfectly-timed, witty remark. He has my same sense of humor and executes jokes with more talent than I do (or ever did). My oldest has a grit determination I wish I had when I was his age. My youngest daughter dances like me and is a fierce social justice warrior. I am an incredibly proud dad.</p><p>Looking back, there are a million things I wish I had done differently as a parent. I regret all the times I raised my voice in anger. I wish I had more readily <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/opting-out?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">acknowledged my children’s school stress</a>, and <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/the-sanctity-of-literacy?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">recognized sooner my two youngest children’s dyslexia</a>. The 19th century Danish theologian and philosopher, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kierkegaard/">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, reminds us that life’s clarity only exists retrospectively.
