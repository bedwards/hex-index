It has provided tremendous possibilities for enhancing productivity, advancing science and public services, and contributing to solving many of the challenges facing humanity. It has brought about fundamental transformations across various fields, making it a cornerstone of the development of modern societies.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is an advanced branch of information technology sciences aimed at developing systems capable of simulating human intelligence through high-performance computing and intelligent software. It relies on advanced algorithms and machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions independently or semi-independently based on input data and parameters.</p><p>Artificial intelligence also processes and recycles the massive amounts of data generated by users, giving it an increasing capacity for adaptation and self-development. This technology is currently used in a wide range of sectors such as medicine and healthcare, where it contributes to diagnosing diseases and analyzing medical data, education through developing interactive learning systems, as well as industry, economy, media, transportation, logistics, and even security and military sectors, including surveillance, ideological and political control, and weapons development.</p><p>When discussing types of artificial intelligence, we can distinguish between different levels of development depending on the nature of comparison.</p><p>The most common type today, in comparison with human intelligence, is narrow artificial intelligence, which is used for specific tasks such as real-time translation, image recognition, operating voice assistants, grammar correction, text generation, and more. This type relies on specific data and operates within a defined scope without the ability to go beyond it.</p><p>On the other hand, general artificial intelligence is a more advanced concept aimed at creating systems capable of thinking and solving problems across multiple domains in the same way the human brain functions. Superintelligent AI, however, is a theoretical future level expected to surpass human abilities in analysis, creativity, and decision-making. But for now, it remains within the realm of science fiction and theoretical studies, or has not been publicly announced yet, as is the case with many technological developments that are usually developed and used secretly for military and security purposes before becoming available to the public.</p><p>History shows that the internet and many other advanced technologies were not revealed to the public until years after their use in closed military, intelligence, and industrial environments.</p><p>This technology does not operate in a vacuum, </p>...</source>
