I am reproducing here my debate in Newsweek on the 33-page document with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/authors/paul-du-quenoy">Paul du Quenoy</a>, president of the Palm Beach Freedom Institute. Basically it tones down concerns about Russia and China and is absurdly hostile to America’s European allies, <a href="https://danperry.substack.com/p/the-us-is-forgetting-the-lessons">replacing decades of values-driven policy</a> (at least in part, at least at times) with a purely transactionist approach (without any concerns for the crises in climate, AI, social media and so on). </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Above, as well, is my TV appearance on this sordid business today.</strong></em></p><div class="pullquote"><p><em><strong>But before that, great news!

On the downside it is basically a manifesto that rips what little mask was left off what the Trump administration seeks to do in the world: It displays open disdain for our European allies, shrugs at the principles of liberal democracy and betrays fidelity to the tech bros’ crusade against desperately needed regulation of their platforms, on the misleading grounds of “free speech.” It imagines a Hobbesian world in which America simply throws its weight around under a sort of Monroe Doctrine redux, shedding the obligations of multilateralism and abandoning any pretense of leading the free world. It’s nothing short of tragic, an own goal that is devastating to America’s brand, doing its damage with ignorance of history and breathtaking arrogance sprinkled on for good measure.</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:417812}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><p><strong>Paul du Quenoy</strong>: Carefully considering the realities of the current world, the Trump administration’s new national security strategy is a masterstroke of realist diplomacy adapted for 21st century America and its needs. Trump has intelligently identified and eliminated tired and ineffective liberal internationalist tropes from our diplomacy, abjured destructive wars of foreign intervention, fore-fronted the security of the United States and its borders in our hemisphere and beyond, committed American soft power to restoring Europe’s beleaguered nation-states, opened paths to constructive engagement with decidedly lesser but potent nuclear-armed adversaries and employed effective to disarm and downscale unproductive and anti-American international institutions.
