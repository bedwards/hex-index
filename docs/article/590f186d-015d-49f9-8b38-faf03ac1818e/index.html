Understanding Lehigh&#039;s history as an engineering and liberal arts university in Pennsylvania&#039;s Lehigh Valley provides context for the working-class intellectualism that defines Michael&#039;s character.</p>

Michael had a 40-minute commute to East Stroudsburg South High School, which used to be just East Stroudsburg until Route 80 caused the population of the Poconos to triple in the 90s, mainly out-of-towners and Hispanics.

A mix of different inflections and backgrounds. He had been teaching in some form or another since 1976. This was the end of his 27th year, and he was tired.</p><p>It was raining when he woke up, and he liked moving about the house in the quiet. These hours were entirely his.
