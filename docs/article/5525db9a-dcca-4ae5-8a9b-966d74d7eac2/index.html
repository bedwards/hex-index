        <blockquote><p>“A thinker on the balcony is the patron of truth, a thinker on the road becomes truth’s servant. And what truth needs is not patrons but servants, servants in whose life, thought and action, theory and practice are one, thinkers who think not concepts but things... The man who makes truths for himself on the balcony is a pure impressionist in his thinking and a pure opportunist in his living.

Nothing is offensive, everything is entertainment; nothing is forbidden, everything is permitted. The journalist is like the jellyfish, given life by that which lies beyond him and forced to feed on the corpse of whatever befalls him by way of the uncaring, capricious turning of the tides around him; some foodstuff or other presents itself and the jellyfish can do no other but feast; some tragedy befalls the neighbour and the individual can do no other put stare in horror; some ...</p>
