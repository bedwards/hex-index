Practitioners of a certain type of literary nonfiction speak her name in hushed tones and with a sense of holy awe. Katie Roiphe, who has quite consciously positioned herself as Malcolm’s inheritor, called her “the only living writer who terrified me.” Her <em>New Yorker </em>colleague Louis Menand, normally the picture of Yankee pragmatism, displayed uncharacteristic fanboyishness when asked about Malcolm, referring to her as his “idol.” “To read Malcolm remaking the profile,” wrote Wyatt Mason of the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>, “is both a lesson for readers (I am learning so much!) and a tacit reproach to fellow practitioners (I am wasting my life!).”</p><p>It’s difficult to avoid this sense of reverence, and difficult not to feel, in the cool perfection of Malcolm’s style, the sense of subtle reproach to one’s own efforts that Mason mentions. It is not only that her sentences are taut, her eye for the telling detail is keen, and her paragraphs are rhythmic and satisfying. She seems to be able to evoke some <em>je ne sais quoi</em> in her writing that the rest of us cannot. Those of us who revere Malcolm also work in the shadow of great magazine journalism and criticism of the 20th century, which distinguished itself primarily through voice and personality. There was Wolfe, peppering the page with exclamation marks, Mailer’s virile blustering, Didion and Thompson and Sontag and Wolcott and all the rest. These writers filtered experience through style; their goal was not only to describe the thing, but how it felt to be a specific person experiencing the thing. The more singular and easily recognizable one’s work was, the more one became not just a reporter or a critic but a star, an early version of an influencer.</p><p>Malcolm plays in a different key, and as I was trying to put my finger on what it was, I thought of one of her tics — her tendency to repeatedly draw comparisons from the work of three writers: Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Henry James. Though she wrote <em>about</em> many 20th-century writers, </p>...</source>
