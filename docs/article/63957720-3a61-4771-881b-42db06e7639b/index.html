      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>In light of the Supreme Court’s decision to not put a hold on Texas’s new abortion law that restricts abortions in that state past 6 weeks, I wanted to write on the importance of the Sanctity of Human Life. However, time would not allow me that pleasure, so I have reposted an older post from earlier in the year explaining my view on the issue. Without a doubt I believe being “pro-life” means more than just being anti-abortion, but make no mistake it <em>CANNOT</em> mean less! Believers especially must hold to a view that any willful taking of any human life is a clear violation of God’s law, and can in no way be described as “justice”, “equity”, or a “right.” God bless! </p><p>     I am unapologetically pro-life. I think abortion on demand is the greatest evil of this age, and I don't think it is even close. Some would argue that racism is still a greater threat, but I would argue that once the Civil Rights Act was passed and state sponsored racism was ended, its not even a close debate. Abortion is the state sponsored and supported murdering of unborn children. And whether that murder is done by pharmaceutical or surgical means does not matter to me, because both are heinous and evil. Besides, whatever claims the pro-child murder crowd wants to make the statistics and science are clear, abortion kills unborn children. As a matter of fact it kills black children at a rate of 3.5 times as many white children.</p><p>     Soooooo, if one wants to make the argument that racism is still alive and well in the US, I would agree if they mean that abortion is the means today of ridding America of black or brown babies. One cannot be consistently racist and be pro-life. Being pro-life means being overwhelmingly in support of a minorities right to live. And please stop with the argument that being pro-life just means being pro-birth. Without Christian organizations supporting life after birth, whether that be orphanages, homes, or other institutions many children would go uncared for by the state at all. I would continue to argue that it is the state that has pushed the church and other Christian institutions out of the arena of caring for the poor, sick, and needy because they have put onerous demands on non-profits and added regulations to make the state the sole caregiver ...</p>
