        <p>My goal with this newsletter is to not only write about the economy as it exists today, but also to explore how technology could change the economy in the years to come. I’ve written about <a href="https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/p/the-robot-takeout-revolution-is-closer">delivery robots</a>, <a href="https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/p/untitled-2">falling battery costs</a>, and <a href="https://www.fullstackeconomics.com/p/i-visited-the-first-whole-foods-that-lets-you-skip-the-checkout-line">Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology</a>.</p><p>In recent weeks I’ve been thinking the most about generative AI software like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion. These technologies have advanced rapidly and I expect them to have large and unpredictable effects on the economy in the coming years.</p><p>I want to spend the next few months reporting on these technologies, the companies behind them, and their economic and policy implications. And while I expect some of you will find that interesting, it’s not the product you signed up for. So today I activated Substack’s “pause paid subscriptions” feature. This means that if you’re a monthly subscriber, you won’t be charged for the next few months.</p><p>In a couple of weeks I’m going to launch a new “pop-up” newsletter focused on AI. It will be my focus for the next few months and I hope you all sign up. Later in the spring, I expect to switch back to posting here at Full Stack Economics with a fresh crop of story ideas inspired by my AI reporting. I’ll restart paid subscriptions at that point.</p><p>If you’re an annual subscriber, Substack will automatically extend your subscription by the length of the pause. But if you’d rather have a pro-rated refund now, please reply directly to this email and I’ll take care of it.</p><p>Thanks for supporting my work!</p>
