I’ve been using the space to try and organise some notes around the ongoing/neverending book project, for which it’s been useful – it’s helpful to have an audience of some sort when writing, since it forces a bit of organisation on my thinking, and feedback is very much appreciated.

The breach with anti-state anarchism in the early workers’ movement, following the collapse of the First International, was never healed – anarchism remained as the minority, critical current relative to the great majority of the labour and socialist movements. But that alliance with the state in turn required the development of state capacity: not only in the sense of the reach of the state, in developing its bureaucratic reach and extending the scope of its functions more widely across social life, but also in the expansion of the economy on which the state rested.
