Rather, what passed through the mathematicians as they struggled with problems were such things as vibrations in their hands, nonsense words in their ears, or blurry shapes in their heads.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>Hadamard, who had the same types of experiences, wrote in <em>The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field </em>that this mode of thinking was distinct from daydreaming, and that most people, though they often think wordlessly, have never experienced the kind of processing that the mathematicians did.</p><p>When I read this, in December 2024, all sorts of questions arose in me. First of all, what does it even mean? Do they not think in words and equations <em>at all</em>? And secondly, how do I square this with my personal experience, which is that whenever I write what I think about a subject, it always turns out that my thoughts do not hold up on paper? No matter how confident I am in my thoughts, they reveal themselves on the page as little but logical holes, contradictions, and non sequiturs.</p><p>I recognize myself when<a href="https://paulgraham.com/words.html?viewfullsite=1"> Paul Graham writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The reason I’ve spent so long establishing [that writing helps you refine your thinking] is that it leads to another [point] that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn’t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.</p></blockquote><p>How come Hadamard’s colleagues are able to have productive thoughts, working in their heads, without words, sometimes, for <em>days</em> on end?</p><h2>Tense subconscious processing</h2><p>Hadamard’s book is most famous for its detailed discussion of what Henri Poincaré called the “sudden illumination”—the moment when the solution to a problem emerges “in the shower” unexpectedly after a long period of unconscious incubation.</p><p>The hypothesis here is that if you work hard on a problem, you soak </p>...</source>
