          <strong>2014 Moldovan bank fraud scandal</strong>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Ilan Shor was convicted for his central role in this billion-dollar theft from Moldova&#039;s banking system, which is why he&#039;s described as a &#039;fugitive oligarch&#039; and &#039;convicted criminal&#039; in the article. Understanding this scandal is essential context for why Shor fled to Moscow and why his &#039;social projects&#039; are viewed as extensions of corrupt influence.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions &#039;ongoing political realignment in Gagauzia&#039; as part of the Shor network&#039;s dissolution. Gagauzia is an autonomous region in Moldova with strong pro-Russian sentiment and its own complex political dynamics that readers may not fully understand.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Kremlin interference tactics including voter bribery, proxy parties, propaganda, and drone incursions - all elements of hybrid warfare.

In it he said (in part): </p><blockquote><p><em>“Today, with a heavy heart, I announce that I am forced to close my social projects in Moldova, which have helped people survive all this time. [...] The funds we transfer are being completely blocked, our employees are being arrested - you all see and know this,”</em></p><p><em>“We are creating a common national front that will resist. [...] We will not abandon or forget our people. The second goal is to overthrow the regime. Assistance to people and social projects will resume in full as soon as the government, which persecutes people simply because we help them, changes,”</em></p></blockquote><p>Shor claimed that over $50 million USD in social aid had been blocked by the government in the last 6 months alone. </p><p>Asked by Newsmaker for comment on the video, Presidential Press Secretary Igor Zakharov replied:</p><blockquote><p><em>“We cannot comment on the lies of a convicted criminal who is hiding from justice in an authoritarian regime and is attempting to destabilize Moldova with dirty money,”</em></p></blockquote><h4>What Social Programs?</h4><p>Over the last decade Shor’s network sought to built a popular movement by providing various services to the rural poor. Many of these were simply aspects of his voter bribery networks, but some included programs for subsidized utilities and other costs in the areas his party controlled. Most visible was his “Merișor” network of shops (some mobile) that sold products at or below market cost to pensioners (<a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/merisorul-lui-sor-favorizat-de-ansa/">while largely ignoring food safety requirements</a>). </p><p>Shor’s announcement that these programs were being shuttered was immediately followed by signals that parts of his broader network was also closing up shop. </p><h4>Mayors Resign</h4><p>On December 2nd, one day after Shor’s announcement, Orhei Mayor Tatiana Cociu <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/mer-orgeeva-podala-v-otstavku-posle-obyavleniya-shora-o-zakrytii-soczproektov-v-moldove-mne-i-kollegam-ugrojayut-arestom">announced her resignation</a>. If you recall, <a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/180004203/shor-and-hybrid-war-updates">she’s been missing now</a> for months and was rumored to be in Moscow hiding from the Moldovan authorities. </p><p>Following her announcement, on December 3rd Taraclia Mayor Veaceslav Lupov also <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/eshe-odin-mer-iz-komandy-shora-podal-v-otstavku-eto-slojnoe-no-edinstvenno-vozmojnoe-chestnoe-reshenie">announced his resignation</a>. He also claimed that the “authorities” were blocking their social projects </p>...</source>
