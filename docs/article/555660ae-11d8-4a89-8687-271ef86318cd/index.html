He wanted the best for them. That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents. And I don’t want the best for them.”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>This apparent inconsistency is a key feature of the Trumpian universe. Trump is, of course, not a “noble spirit”: he hates his opponents and considers them trash to be annihilated. However, in order to somehow justify his brutal hatred, he needs a figure like Kirk as a good man who wants the best even for his enemies. (It’s a little bit like Christians who need the good Christ, whose death justifies brutal persecution of anti-Christians.) This is why Kirk needs to be elevated into a figure of martyrdom of almost divine proportions: this elevation is just the obverse of the brutality of the Trumpian ethos. The standard hypocritical logic claims that we are attacking a country or a people to help the victims of its oppressive regime. In the 1930s, even Japan argued that it occupied most of China to civilize its people – the Chinese are like naughty children who have to be disciplined for their own good… In the ongoing Middle East war, Bernard-Henri Lévy tried to follow this line: Israel is doing what it does in Gaza and on the West Bank to help Palestinians, to liberate them from the grip of Muslim fundamentalists who oppress them…</p><p>With Trump and Israel, the masks have fallen; the enemy is simply to be destroyed, and again, for this a figure like Kirk is needed. Trump is not original here – on the very first page of his Republic, Plato wonderfully depicts how the Trumpian populists (here represented by Polemarchus) treat their opponents (here represented by Socrates, the narrator):</p><p>“Polemarchus said to me: ‘I perceive, Socrates, that you </p>...</source>
