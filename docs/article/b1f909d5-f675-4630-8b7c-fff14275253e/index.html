        <p>There’s really only one place to start: The Velvet Room.</p><p>No, that’s not its real name. No, I’m not even sure all those furnishings are actually velvet. I simply do not care, because it’s my favorite room in the entire Museum and guess what? It ain’t even close. As such, it’s the purest candidate to represent what this project is all about. It’s not the biggest, it’s not the fanciest, it’s not the most well-apportioned or masterpiece-laden, but it’s my absolute fucking <em>favorite</em>.</p><p>Why? Partly it has to do with personal history: this was the room that touched me most deeply upon my very first visit to The Met some eight or nine years ago. Partly, it has to do with the fact that it boasts the comfiest seating option in the whole Museum: a two (sometimes three?) seat velvety couch facing directly towards a gorgeous fireplace and three magnificent Rembrandts.

Since so much of the art came from the Lehman family townhouse, the Lehman Wing (which sits at the very back of the Met, and is therefore one of the least trafficked areas of the Museum) is seemingly designed to feel like you’re still in that townhouse. It’s laid out like a walk through a 20th Century banking magnate’s display rooms, and it works gloriously.</p><p>Inside what I’m calling the Velvet Room, you have the aforementioned couch and fireplace, beautiful burgundy velvet walls, grand velvet curtains, an imposing wooden doorframe, and an oddly unremarkable brass chandelier. The lighting is made up of directional spotlights on individual pieces and a soft blue-white glow emanating from above the wooden panelling. It’s calm, soft, womb-like.</p><p>The vibe in the room is almost invariably quiet and calm; visitors are somehow compelled to whisper inside it, which ...</p>
