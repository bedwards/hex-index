Some of you are fans of our current president, and some of you are not. If you are not, I remind you of a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/amerfuture.htm">saying</a> that was popularized by an indisputably great president, Abraham Lincoln: “And this, too, shall pass away.”</p><p>I also hope you had a great Valentine’s Day. Or as outgoing Goldman Sachs general counsel <strong>Kathryn Ruemmler</strong> <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/13/business/heres-the-crude-email-exchange-with-jeffrey-epstein-that-ended-kathy-ruemmlers-stint-as-goldman-sachs-top-lawyer/">wrote</a> to her longtime pal Jeffrey Epstein, “I hope you enjoy[ed] the day with your one true love. :-)”</p><p>Speaking of Epstein, I spent much of last week reporting and writing two stories related to the late financier/sexual predator, <a href="https://davidlat.substack.com/p/brad-karp-scott-barshay-paul-weiss-progressive-culture-vampire-rule">Paul Weiss’s Firm Culture Fell Victim To The Vampire Rule</a> and <a href="https://davidlat.substack.com/p/paul-weiss-chair-brad-karp-emails-with-jeffrey-epstein">5 Takeaways From Brad Karp’s Emails With Jeffrey Epstein</a>. If you haven’t read them, I do think they’re worth your time, especially if you missed the footnotes (which didn’t appear in the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-exchange-insights-and-commentary/paul-weiss-progressive-culture-fell-victim-to-the-vampire-rule">Bloomberg Law</a> version of my “vampire rule” column). I’ve also added updates to both stories that you should check out.</p><p>Here at OJ, which isn’t focused on breaking news, I’m rarely the first to cover a story. But I like to think that when I do cover something, I add a depth of reporting and analysis that’s hard to find elsewhere. To my subscribers, your support makes that possible—otherwise, I’d be juggling my writing with a day job—so I thank you.</p><p>On a related note, perhaps you can give me some career advice. I write about both the courts and law firms, but sometimes I wonder if I’d be better off focusing on one or the other. Please take my poll:</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:449726}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><p>Now, on to the news.</p><p><strong>Lawyer of the Week: Kathryn Ruemmler.</strong></p><p>Last Thursday, <strong>Kathy Ruemmler</strong> (finally) announced that she will resign as GC of Goldman Sachs (eventually—effective June 30). “My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’s interests first,” she said in a statement. And the interests of Goldman were clearly being disserved by the Epstein-related controversies swirling around Ruemmler, who appears more than 10,000 times in the Epstein files.</p><p>The mentions are often <a href="https://davidlat.substack.com/p/thomas-goldstein-trial-brad-karp-kathy-ruemmler-jeffrey-epstein-4000-an-hour-billing-rate">embarrassing</a>—such as thanking “Uncle Jeffrey” for lavish gifts, like a $9,350 Hermès handbag, or asking for his advice about an <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/03/us-news/goldman-sachs-kathy-ruemmler-accused-of-affair-emails/">affair</a> she </p>...</source>
