        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Manafort as one of Trump&#039;s close associates who &#039;acted like a Russian agent of influence.&#039; Understanding Manafort&#039;s extensive history as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, his criminal convictions, and his role in the 2016 campaign provides essential context for the pattern the author is describing.</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p><p>I was writing a piece comparing the Trump and Biden Administration’s positions on Ukraine’s future when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript">the Bloomberg story broke yesterday with transcripts of a conversation between Steve Witkoff and a Yuri Ushakov, a very senior Putin adviser</a>. As such, I have made a quick pivot and will talk about that story, and release the Biden/Trump piece tomorrow (or the day after if my US readers want a break for Thanksgiving).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png" width="835" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:835,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:661483,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/i/180011048?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v-R0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1046f64a-428c-4c00-8081-aa75f0d2c50b_835x560.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Witkoff and Ushakov</figcaption></figure></div><p>The Bloomberg piece was almost ideally and tragically timed to go with the piece I had released earlier in the day yesterday.

The attempts to separate Trump from the catastrophes of his own administration’s actions is unprecedented. First it was said that this was some rogue operation by stupid and naive Steve Witkoff, who was freelancing and hoodwinked by the clever Russians.</em></p><p>Almost immediately after the Bloomberg story was written, the chorus of Trump excuses started again saying such things as: “Trump did not know about the 28-point plan” (laughable) or “Trump was fooled by Witkoff” (risible). This need to try and say that Trump was not and therefore ultimately is not responsible for the policies of his administration is deplorable and shows why Trump has been able to do so much damage as people sit by and make excuses for him. Just a few points to show why.</p><ul><li><p>The Bloomberg story actually proves Trump was being kept in the loop. Witkoff would only be advising the Russians in this matter if Trump was going to be updated on the situation. Why would Witkoff be talking about how Trump should be approached, unless he knew Trump would be approached—on exactly these issues. So the whole context of the Witkoff-Ushakov discussion was predicated on Trump being consulted.</p></li><li><p>The reaction to the Bloomberg story shows Trump was more than happy with Witkoff’s behavior and indeed confirmed Witkoff’s role by saying he will soon be off </p></li></ul>...</source>
