        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Manafort as one of Trump&#039;s close associates who &#039;acted like a Russian agent of influence.&#039; Understanding Manafort&#039;s extensive history as a political consultant for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians, his criminal convictions, and his role in the 2016 campaign provides essential context for the pattern the author is describing.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly describes individuals as acting like &#039;Russian agents of influence.&#039; FARA is the specific U.S. law governing foreign agent registration, and understanding its requirements, history of enforcement, and recent high-profile cases (including against Manafort) illuminates the legal framework surrounding the conduct being criticized.</p>
