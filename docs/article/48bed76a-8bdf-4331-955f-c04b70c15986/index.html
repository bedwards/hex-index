      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I’ve asked many of my friends and family members to tell me their favorite scripture. There is one verse that is by far the most said: Helamen 5:12. It reads:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p></blockquote><p>Why this scripture? What is it about Helamen 5:12 that resonates with so many? As I chatted with my wife on the subject one conclusion really stood out to me.&nbsp;</p><p>Helamen 5:12 is relatable. Life has its mighty storms and whirlwinds. At times it feels like nothing is going our way. Sometimes the rains come and they don’t seem to stop. So what can we do? This scripture gives us a solution.&nbsp;</p><p>Christ is the strong foundation that will get us through life’s tempests. Notice, a foundation in Christ does not eliminate trouble in life. The devil will continue to tempt, life will continue to surprise you, and rain will still fall. HOWEVER, when our foundation is in Jesus Christ — these things will have “no power” over us. We will rise conquerer from any circumstance.&nbsp;</p><p>A foundation in Christ allows our troubled hearts and minds to fall back into a protected embrace. For me, a foundation on Christ helps me remember that He has already overcome all. He lived and suffered and died so that He knows all of the possible trials that life can through at us. He is by our side when we are in the storm and He will get us through.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a reason so many love this scripture. It gives hope to the human experience. It brings us together, we all face challenges daily no matter who we are. I hope you will reread this verse and feel its significance. How can you build a foundation on Christ?&nbsp;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg" width="1100" height="688" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:688,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2005111,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lYOK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78899889-d4b1-4ebb-a5ac-17644ef8a0e4_4000x2500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div></source>
