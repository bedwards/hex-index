        <p><strong>CHINA STEALS SECRETS</strong> through a “network of defense attachés, academics, and spies operating in and out of China,” according to federal court documents, and one of them was until 2018 serving as a soldier in the U.S. Army.</p><p>Ji Chaoqun, a Chinese national, was <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.356808/gov.uscourts.ilnd.356808.372.0.pdf">convicted of espionage</a> last month in Chicago, Illinois. A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-army-reservist-convicted-acting-within-united-states-unregistered-agent-people-s">Justice Department news release touting the verdict revealed</a> that the 31-year-old had worked for years on behalf of China before joining the U.S. Army Reserve in 2016. He faces up to 15 years in prison at <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.356808/gov.uscourts.ilnd.356808.372.0.pdf">sentencing in January 2023</a>.</p><p>It certainly won’t end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_spy_cases_in_the_United_States_of_America">Chinese spying in the United States</a>.

And when reading through evidence revealed in court filings, we can get a sense of Beijing’s recruiting process.</p>
