        <p class="topic-summary">The JCPOA is central to understanding the current tensions. Readers would benefit from deep context on its negotiation history, specific technical provisions, the 2018 US withdrawal, and the snapback mechanism being invoked by European powers.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions Fordow as the underground facility holding 60%-enriched uranium that was bombed. Its construction deep inside a mountain, discovery history, and strategic significance explain why it&#039;s a focal point of the nuclear standoff.</p>

Israeli strikes could be just days or weeks away, with Netanyahu hoping that, this time, the United States will be drawn into yet another protracted, bloody regime-change campaign to further the Israeli agenda.   </p><div><hr></div><p>On Thursday, France, Germany and the United Kingdom notified the UN Security Council that they were starting the process to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran via “snapback” provisions of the 2015 nuclear deal. </p><p>Under that agreement — the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — Iran agreed to <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/328996">many additional safeguards</a> to ensure its nuclear program remains peaceful. For example, Iran eliminated its inventory of medium-enriched uranium, cut its low-enriched uranium by 98%, capped future enrichment at 3.67%, and rendered its heavy-water reactor inoperable by filling it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35285095">with concrete</a>. In exchange, Iran was granted sanctions relief. </p><p>Despite Iran’s compliance with the JCPOA, President Trump spontaneously withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposed US sanctions that his administration called “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46071747">the toughest sanctions ever imposed</a>” on Iran. <a href="https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/advocates-of-economic-sanctions-mirror">Victimized</a> by a new round of Israel-encouraged US economic warfare, and lacking any other leverage to nudge the United States back into the deal, Iran began enriching uranium well above the levels allowed under the JCPOA. </p><p>Parroting Israel, Trump has insisted that Iran must cease all nuclear enrichment, something Tehran has categorically ruled out for years, asserting that it’s Iran’s right, both as a sovereign state and — <a href="https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/every-dollar-of-aid-to-israel-breaks">unlike nuclear-armed Israel</a> — as a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Internal politics play a significant role in the impasse, with important Iranian segments opposed to bending to Western demands on a point of national pride for the scientifically-advanced country.  </p><p>In something akin to Vito Corleone’s “offer that can’t be refused,” US-Israeli insistence on zero enrichment is — quite deliberately — a demand that won’t be accepted. To the benefit of the warmongers, this demand helps ensure perpetual tension and recurring US-Israeli military brinksmanship, all pursuant to </p>...</source>
