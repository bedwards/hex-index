If the subsidies are not extended before the end of the year, the impacts will be cataclysmic.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/2025-kff-marketplace-enrollees-survey">22 million Americans</a> who currently receive these subsidies will see their premiums <a href="https://www.kff.org/affordable-care-act/mapping-the-uneven-burden-of-rising-aca-marketplace-premium-payments-due-to-enhanced-tax-credit-expiration/">increase by an average of 114%</a>. According to an analysis by the Urban Institute, families with incomes below 250% of the poverty line will pay premiums that are more than four times higher — rising <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/48-million-people-will-lose-coverage-2026-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits">from $169 to $919</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, an estimated <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/48-million-people-will-lose-coverage-2026-if-enhanced-premium-tax-credits">4.8 million people will lose coverage completely</a> because they are priced out of the market. Uninsured people, of course, continue to get sick and require emergency medical care. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation <a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/our-research/2025/09/how-expiration-of-aca-tax-credits-will-affect-healthcare-spending.html">projects</a> “a $7.7 billion spike in uncompensated care in 2026” if the subsidies expire.</p><p>The impact will be most severe in <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/changes-health-care-spending-and-uncompensated-care-under-enhanced-tax-credit">large Republican-leaning states</a> that have not expanded Medicaid, including Florida and Texas, because they rely on the Obamacare marketplace to cover many of their low-income residents. Those states will see their uncompensated care costs rise by as much as 25%.</p><p>A study by the Commonwealth Fund also estimates that failing to extend the subsidies will result in <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2025/oct/expiring-premium-tax-credits-lead-340000-jobs-lost-2026">the loss of 339,100 jobs</a> due to reduced health care spending.</p><p>In an interview with Politico published on Tuesday, President Trump was asked if he planned to let the subsidies expire. This was his <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/09/donald-trump-full-interview-transcript-00681693?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nrid=00000164-8fc0-d4a7-a5fc-9fce06f00000">response</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I want to give the money to the people to buy their own health care. That’s a good thing, not a bad thing. The Democrats don’t want to do that. They want the insurance companies to continue to make a fortune. The Democrats are owned by the insurance companies. They want the insurance companies to get these trillions of dollars. We spent ... we spend trillions of dollars [that] goes to the insurance companies. I want that money to go to the people and let the people go out and buy their own health care. It works like magic. But you know who doesn’t want it? The Democrats, because they’re corrupt people because they’re totally owned and bought by the insurance companies.</p></blockquote><p>Trump makes a compelling case that the private insurance industry has excessive profits.
