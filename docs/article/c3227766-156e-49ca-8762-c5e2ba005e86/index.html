        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly compares early Russia-Ukraine negotiations to the 1938 Munich Agreement, calling it &#039;a disastrous capitulation to Hitler.&#039; Understanding this historical appeasement policy and its consequences provides essential context for evaluating current diplomatic approaches to Putin.</p>

Understanding the eight-year conflict that preceded the 2022 invasion, including Russian-backed separatism and the Minsk agreements, provides crucial context for why this territory is central to negotiations.</p>

Kyiv seeks binding international security guarantees and a ceasefire that maintains current frontlines, which it hints it might accept in practice (if not formally recognize), while Moscow is doubling down on demands. Putin has reiterated that the war would end only “once Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they occupy,” referring to lands recognized internationally (and in the 1990s by Russia) as Ukrainian. It’s none too promising.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em><strong>We’ve extended our Thanksgiving 20% off discount subscription offer!

Meanwhile Russia launched nearly 1,400 attack drones, 1,100 guided aerial bombs, and 66 missiles last week alone. Ukraine has responded with long-range drone strikes on Russian oil facilities and Black Sea shipping. Again, unpromising.</p><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:413098}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><p>Against this backdrop, I joined a debate on the I24 station with <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/fred-fleitz-74b82a16">Fred Fleitz</a>, a  thinktanky Trump advocate, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illia_Ponomarenko">Illia Ponomarenko</a>, a Ukrainian journalist who staunchly defends his country’s staunch stand. Something interesting happened: We agreed on little that came before, but concluded anyway that more pressure on Russia would be needed: That Putin must feel the cost of his aggression at a level that threatens the regime, which like all vile dictatorships will fall one day. </p><p>I said  the 28-point plan was a total non-starter — while the 19-point plan is a no-go with Putin even though that too contains painful concessions by Ukraine. “It reminds me a little bit of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict … one side’s maximum will give does not meet the other’s minimal demand.” Ponomarenko pressed the risk of appeasement: “Who told anybody that by disarming Ukraine … will not be used by Russia to resume war in an even better position?” He betrayed some  paranoia there, and I answered: “Everyone said that. There’s no disputing it” — which is why the second plan no longer places limits ...</p>
