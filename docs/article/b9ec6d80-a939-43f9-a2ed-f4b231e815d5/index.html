        <p><em>Very short summary: In this essay, I defend the central importance of the idea of public reason in liberal social and political morality. It is incompatible with political violence in all circumstances. The idea of public reason is however a late discovery of humanity and is fragile. It can quickly unravel as soon as some members of the population suspect others to be unwilling to meet its demand.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>A recurrent theme discussed in this newsletter is the idea of public reason. It's not only because it refers to a research program – public reason liberalism – with which I identify and that largely informs my recent academic work.

As Rawls put it, in this sense, the idea of public reason entails a "duty of civility" for all citizens, or at least for political actors who, in one way or another, are making rules that will have authority over everyone.
