        <p>A few days after Pope Leo XIV warned against potential American military action in Venezuela, the Venezuelan regime barred a local cardinal with a Vatican passport from leaving the country, raising questions about whether the Vatican will respond more forcefully to the Maduro regime.</p><p>Cardinal Porras’ detention has exposed a long-running tension in Vatican diplomacy: the attempt to advocate for peace in Venezuela without seeming blind to the human rights’ abuses fueling Venezuela’s crisis. The Holy See has long prioritized protecting clergy and preserving its role as mediator, opting for quiet diplomacy instead of public confrontation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:233321,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.pillarcatholic.com/i/181457580?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!h_QZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43397441-dade-48e3-aa60-b5c2df025b0a_1458x972.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Credit: CFimages / Alamy</figcaption></figure></div><p>But that restraint has often made papal calls for dialogue and Leo’s criticism of an American threat seem detached from the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses on the ground.</p><p>The treatment of Porras now raises the question of whether the Holy See must change course and show that it can speak with greater moral clarity while still safeguarding the Church’s presence and keeping open the diplomatic channels vital to any future agreement to end the country’s crisis.</p><p>During a Dec. 2 <a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-12/pope-leo-xiv-inflight-press-conference-turkiye-lebanon.html">press conference</a> returning from his trip to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo was asked about his opinion on an American military threat on Venezuela.
