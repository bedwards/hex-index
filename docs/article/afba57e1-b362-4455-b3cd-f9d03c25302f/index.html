You can find that below and I encourage you to do so.

First, I’m just deeply appreciative of the recognition and genuinely touched by the award. It means a lot! Second, I’m always looking for opportunities to thank the people who have helped me along the way. This feels like a perfect moment for that… </p><p>Chief among the people I wish to thank are the many editors I’ve had over the years at various outlets, starting at <em>Slate</em> with Laura Helmuth and Susan Matthews, followed by the late, great <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/06/business/media/fred-hiatt-dead.html">Fred Hiatt</a> at <em>The Washington Post</em>. They taught me how to balance being critical and incisive while still remaining kind, and helped me think through what was important to say in each moment. More recently, I’ve had superb experiences with Alexandra Sifferlin and Alex Ellerbeck at <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>. </p><p>I also want to thank the good people at Facebook (yes, there are many!) whose beautiful but short-lived project, <em>Bulletin</em>, first gave me the freedom to make writing a major part of my professional career—and those at <em>Substack</em> and <em>MedPage Today</em> who have helped me keep that dream alive.</p><p>Then there are the two writers who have taught me the most, starting with my mom, who, when I was in grade school, had me editing her San Francisco Chronicle children’s book reviews.
