        <p><em>Pillar paid subscribers can listen to Ed read this Pillar Post here: <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-friday-pillar-post-december-12">The Pillar TL;DR</a></em></p><p>Happy Friday friends,</p><p>I am back in Washington after our first-ever Pillar Pilgrimage to Rome. It was, honestly, a time of great consolation for me.</p><p>The first weeks of Advent are meant, as we all know, to lift our eyes a little higher to the horizon of the end of time and the coming of the Lord in glory.

Or will Christ find me waiting expectantly for the dawn, animated by the reality of his incarnation, and confident in the resurrection?</p><p>I certainly hope it is the latter.</p><p>This weekend is Gaudete Sunday, of course. And as I was discussing with a newly made friend while in Rome, it’s worth remembering that it is an imperative, not a suggestion. Sharing joy around Christmas is an important part of bearing witness to the truth of the holy day. But as important is sharing the reason for our joy.</p><p>When I arrived home, there was an immediate seasonal to-do list. There is a four-year-old clamoring for a tree, and I feel the internal impulse of the suburban dad to bust out the ladder and wrap the house in lights, both of which I will see to ...</p>
