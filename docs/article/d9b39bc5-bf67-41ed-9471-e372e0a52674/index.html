        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">This is the scholarly name for the exact passage being analyzed (John 7:53-8:11). The Wikipedia article covers the fascinating textual history - how this story doesn&#039;t appear in the earliest manuscripts and was likely added later, its disputed authenticity, and theories about its origins. This provides essential context for understanding the passage&#039;s place in biblical scholarship.</p>

          <span class="read-time">19 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on Jesus preventing a stoning. The Wikipedia article covers the history of stoning as capital punishment in ancient Jewish law, Roman law&#039;s restrictions on Jewish execution rights (relevant to the &#039;trap&#039; mentioned), and the specific Mosaic laws about adultery punishment. This illuminates the legal and cultural stakes of the encounter.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article includes Pippin&#039;s painting &#039;The Woman Taken in Adultery.&#039; Pippin was a self-taught African American artist who painted biblical scenes with profound spiritual depth despite having a partially paralyzed arm from WWI. His approach to religious art and his remarkable life story would enrich the reader&#039;s appreciation of the featured artwork.</p>

Swarms of people came to him. He sat down and taught them.</p><p>The religion scholars and Pharisees led in a woman who had been caught in an act of adultery. They stood her in plain sight of everyone and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught red-handed in the act of adultery. Moses, in the Law, gives orders to stone such persons. What do you say?” They were trying to trap him into saying something incriminating so they could bring charges against him.</p><p>Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger in the dirt. They kept at him, badgering him. He straightened up and said, “The sinless one among you, go first: Throw the stone.” Bending down again, he wrote some more in the dirt.</p><p>Hearing that, they walked away, one after another, beginning with the oldest. The woman was left alone. Jesus stood up and spoke to her. “Woman, where are they? Does no one condemn you?”</p><p>“No one, Master.”</p><p>“Neither do I,” said Jesus. “Go on your way. From now on, don’t sin.”</p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic" width="500" height="413" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:413,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:37806,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://sarahbessey.substack.com/i/175044808?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!br2m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8b16ee3-3d0f-42a2-8311-ca195a091778_500x413.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Woman Taken in Adultery by Horace Pippin, Public Domain</figcaption></figure></div><h1>The “Unexpecteds” of the Story</h1><p>This week, we’re going </p>...</source>
