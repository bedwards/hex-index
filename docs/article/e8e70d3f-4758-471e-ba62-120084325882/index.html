Since the beginning of December all the fast-moving planets Mars, Mercury and Venus have been passing on the retrograde baton to each other, indicating an exceptionally long period of constant reconsideration and reevaluation in different areas. In the course of this four-month period, quite a few of us will have changed their attitudes, alliances and their minds – and likely more than once.</p><p>Mercury will already turn direct on April 8 and Venus will follow on April 14. Planning will become more reliable in the course of this month as Mercury will slowly pick up speed, and matters that we have been forced to revise or which we have been mentally chewing on in the last four weeks can finally see a closure toward the end of April. The adjustment of relationship matters could take a little longer, but by the middle of May we should be forging ahead.</p><p>As much as we are tempted to gladly look ahead, in the first two weeks of April careful planning and systematic execution is high on the agenda as the first half of the months seems important for our progress in the near future. It’s interesting that both Mercury and Venus first shake hands with Saturn before changing gear and turning direct. It’s as if task-master Saturn has to provide some ‘disciplinary’ advice or wants give out reminders regarding communication and relationships. Situations might arise that require a clearer definition of tasks, rules, roles and goals. Especially if you have planetary placements around 25° of Pisces, Cancer of Scorpio, a prudent approach in the first two weeks could pay off in the long-run.</p><p>Another planetary peculiarity in April is that Venus will be hanging around the degrees of Saturn in Pisces for the entire month, addressing matters of appropriateness in relationships. Practical considerations as well as paying or not paying respect to each other’s boundaries could play a large role in the way we relate to each other. Some of us might see themselves forced to administer ‘tough love’, whereas the ones on the receiving end could temporarily suffer from feelings of insecurity or rejection, </p>...</source>
