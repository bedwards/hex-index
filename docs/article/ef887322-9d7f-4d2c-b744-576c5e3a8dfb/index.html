Command and control, force structure, strategy, tactics and adaptation were all topics I examined.  </em></p><p><em>But one other subject was also important. It is a topic that I have returned to on each of my visits to Ukraine: military training. Training, and a training system that is responsive to battlefield learning and adaptation, is crucial to building effective and resilient military personnel and teams. To that end, I have just published a short article with the Lowy Institute on this vital subject.</em></p><p>The study of how Ukrainian forces have adapted, learned, and transformed their training regimes is a vital but under-examined element of this war, and war more generally. Ukraine’s military training system is foundational to its military capability. Studying it offers not only a window into Ukraine’s overall military capacity but also valuable lessons for Western nations that may need to expand their forces in the coming years.</p><h2><strong>Challenges</strong></h2><p>Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has faced multiple challenges to its training approach.</p><p>First, it has had to manage time constraints. The Russian military, vastly larger than Ukraine’s, drove the need for rapid expansion of the pre-war force. Limited time meant many important trade-offs had to be made in the quality of training. For a long period, basic recruit training was restricted to about one month, which often did not produce the resilient and capable soldiers required on the front line without additional training in their units.</p><p>Second, Ukraine has had to balance the key cultures that drive its military affairs: legacy Soviet systems and practices (especially intolerance of reporting failure, and centralised command methods); newer NATO methods and doctrines; and Ukraine’s own culture, both military and national. These often exist in tension and influence every element of Ukrainian military affairs, including its training systems.</p><p>Third, it has had to endure, to the present day, Russian attacks on its training institutions. These attacks are designed to kill soldiers in training and the experts that train them. The attacks are designed to have a psychological impact too, particularly in dissuading Ukrainians from joining their military.</p><p>Finally, </p>...</source>
