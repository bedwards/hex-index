        <p><a href="https://snapcoalition.org/">SNAP (Science Network for Advocacy and Policy)</a> is a grassroots, primarily graduate student-led organization working to build the next generation of science policy leaders. They are organizing in-district and virtual meetings with Congressional offices across the country this summer to advocate for strong federal investments in science, equitable funding policies, and support for early-career researchers.</p><p>Whether you’ve written a <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/asap/events-initiatives/the-mcclintock-letters/">McClintock Letter</a>, spoken at a town hall, or are new to policy advocacy, they want to amplify your voice! You can join as an individual and they will place you with a group based on your congressional district, or you can sign up as a group (e.g., your lab, a student group). Either way, SNAP will make sure you have everything you need to feel confident and prepared!</p><p>SNAP will help groups set up short meetings with their local Members of Congress (in person or over Zoom), with no prior experience needed! They will handle the logistics and provide training and talking points for groups.</p><p>If you're interested in getting involved, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/SEe8CtFGEjXFiLyX9">this form</a> by August 1st (tomorrow)! The form helps SNAP match you to others in your congressional district, provide training, and learn about your goals, connections, and availability. </p><p>Reach out with any questions, comments, or concerns to <a href="mailto:a.rich@yale.edu">a.rich@yale.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:SNAPscipolorg@gmail.com">SNAPscipolorg@gmail.com</a></p>
