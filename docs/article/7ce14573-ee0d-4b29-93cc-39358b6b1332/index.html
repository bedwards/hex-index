        <p class="topic-summary">The article references the John Birch Society as representative of conservative American Cold War attitudes about preserving Christendom from communism. Understanding this influential far-right organization provides crucial context for the ideological roots of current American conservative views toward Europe and Western civilization.</p>

After having its power broken, Poland was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland">carved up in the 1700s</a> and subjugated by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. It took more than two centuries, until the fall of communism in 1991, for Poland to reemerge as a strong, truly independent country. </p><p>The Deluge shows that power and independence are not permanent. If you are surrounded by hostile powers, and if you don’t have the ability to guard yourself against those powers, no amount of historical greatness can save you from being subjugated. This is an important lesson for Europeans to remember right now, as they find their region under siege from Russia, China, and the United States all at once.</p><h4>The United States no longer cares about the European project</h4><p>Why would America care about Europe at all? For most of our history, we didn’t. In the 19th century, the U.S. viewed European countries as dangerous rivals. In the early 20th century, Americans prided themselves on not getting involved in European affairs, and were incensed at their government for dragging them into World War 1. Only after World War 2 did Americans start caring about Europe, and we did so for three reasons:</p><ol><li><p>West Europe was a bulwark against Soviet communism.</p></li><li><p>Europe was a key trading partner.</p></li><li><p>Many Americans came to value their ancestral ties to Europe.</p></li></ol><p>The first of these reasons vanished in 1991. Europe is still a bulwark against <em>Russia</em>, but Americans no longer feel threatened by Russia. Russian power is far less than what it once was, and Russia’s rightist ideology does not threaten the rightists who now rule America. </p><p>As for communism, many (most?) Americans now believe that European countries are socialist. When American conservatives ask where in the world socialism has succeeded, American progressives will always reply “Europe” or “Scandinavia”. Whether Europe or Scandinavia is <em>actually</em> socialist is irrelevant; Americans have come to see it that way. </p><p>Europe<em> is</em> still an important trading partner. But Trump and the other people now in charge of the U.S. <em><a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/trade-deficits-do-not-make-a-country">do not understand trade at all</a></em>. They think about trade entirely in terms of the <em>net trade balance</em>, rather </p>...</source>
