        <p>NAD+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is one of the most talked-about molecules in the longevity world. It plays a critical role in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and mitochondrial function. As we age, NAD+ levels decline, and that decline has been linked to fatigue, muscle loss, and slower recovery.</p><p>This led to the rise of NAD+ boosters like NMN and NR, marketed as anti-aging interventions aiming to restore what time takes away.</p><p>But what if we’ve misunderstood the relationship?</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>New Research: Muscles Function Normally Despite NAD+ Loss</strong></h2><p>A groundbreaking <em><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00212-8">Cell Metabolism</a></em><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00212-8"> study (2024)</a> put the NAD+ theory to the test. Researchers genetically deactivated <em>Nampt</em>, a critical enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway, in adult mice, causing an <strong>85% reduction in NAD+ levels</strong>specifically in skeletal muscle.</p><p>The results were surprising:</p><ul><li><p>Muscle strength and endurance remained normal</p></li><li><p>Mitochondria continued functioning effectively</p></li><li><p>No acceleration in biological aging (measured via DNA methylation clocks)</p></li><li><p>Metabolic health markers like glucose tolerance were unchanged</p></li></ul><p>Despite such a severe depletion of NAD+, <strong>the muscle tissue was remarkably resilient</strong>.</p><p>This challenges the idea that NAD+ decline is a primary driver of muscle aging. Instead, it may be a <strong>byproduct</strong>, a downstream effect of deeper dysfunctions like inflammation, mitochondrial impairment, or cellular stress response failure.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Downstream vs. Upstream: Where Should We Intervene?</strong></h2><p>Think of NAD+ as fuel. Supplying more of it via NMN or NR is like topping off the gas tank, but what if the real problem is a failing engine?</p><p><strong>NAD+ supplementation is a downstream intervention</strong>: it temporarily raises levels of a molecule whose decline might reflect upstream breakdowns, like inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, or impaired stress responses. It doesn’t restore the body’s innate ability to maintain NAD+, nor does it repair the underlying systems that rely on it.</p><p>This is why a growing number of researchers now advocate targeting upstream mechanisms, particularly mitochondrial health and inflammation, as more effective levers for promoting longevity.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Enter Urolithin A: A Mitochondrial Makeover</strong></h2><p>One of the most promising upstream interventions is <strong>Urolithin A</strong> — a postbiotic compound produced by gut microbes from dietary ellagitannins (found in foods like pomegranate and walnuts). Urolithin A doesn’t raise NAD+ directly. Instead, it <strong>restores mitochondrial health</strong> by stimulating two essential processes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mitophagy</strong> — the clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria</p></li><li><p><strong>Mitogenesis</strong> — the creation of new, efficient mitochondria</p></li></ul><p>As we age, mitochondrial turnover slows, leading to accumulated damage, reduced energy output, and increased oxidative stress, ...</p>
