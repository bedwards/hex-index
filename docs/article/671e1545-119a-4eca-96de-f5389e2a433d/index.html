Her remarks prompted a backlash from Beijing. The dynamics unfolding in the coming months could reshape geopolitics across the Taiwan Strait and beyond.<br><br>Speculation about Beijing’s intentions towards Taiwan has surged since President Xi Jinping assumed power in late 2012. Xi has intensified Chinese drills in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Things escalated after William Lai Ching-te – known for his pro-independence proclivities – took over as Taiwan’s leader in 2024, prompting more frequent and expansive mainland exercises.<br><br>The US remains Beijing’s chief obstacle, bolstering Taiwan through consistent arms sales and the Taiwan Relations Act.<br><br>Since formalising diplomatic ties with China in 1979, Washington has navigated the issue with calculated ambiguity. Chinese leaders have consistently invoked the one-China principle, urging reduced US support for the island.</p><p>In response, the US endorses a “one-China policy” that acknowledges Beijing’s position without endorsing it, while maintaining strategic vagueness on potential intervention in a cross-strait conflict.<br><br>As Taiwan represents one of Washington’s strongest leverage points against Beijing, relinquishing it has seemed improbable, until now.<br><br>Trump’s dismissive rhetoric towards Taiwan – accusing it of stealing America’s semiconductor dominance – has emboldened Beijing’s hawks. To them, Trump’s world view prioritises bilateral horse trading over ideological crusades, viewing alliances as transactional burdens rather than sacred oaths.<br><br>Against this evolving US-China landscape, Beijing’s recent orchestrated signals on Taiwan, alongside its sharp rebukes of Japan, warrant close scrutiny.<br><br>One notable cue came in September, when China’s state broadcaster aired a prime-time 39-episode drama, Silent Honour, chronicling the real-life exploits of Wu Shi, </p>...</source>
