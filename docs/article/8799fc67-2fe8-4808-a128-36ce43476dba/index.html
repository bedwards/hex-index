More than a trillion dollars is held by just 1,800 families, the top 0.01 per cent of wealth holders, according to a <a href="https://www.pbo-dpb.ca/en/publications/RP-2526-009-S--estimating-top-tail-family-wealth-distribution-in-canada-2025-update--estimation-extremite-superieure-distribution-patrimoine-familial-canada-mises-jour-2025">new report from the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)</a>.</p><p>“PBO finds that there were approximately 169,400 families in the top one per cent in 2023, and they each had a net wealth of at least $7.4 million.
