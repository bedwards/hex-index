        <p>As I’ve mentioned before, I’m not a huge fan of the sitting president.  I think this second Trump term is <em>by far the worst term of a president in my life-time</em>, and that Trump will go down in history as among the worst presidents ever, if not as one of history’s major villains.  But because the administration is a whirling vortex of non-stop insanity,  it’s almost impossible to keep track of all his failings.  </p><p>This isn’t typical.  If you get five people who didn’t like Bush, Biden, or Obama in a room, and ask them why they opposed him, you’ll get pretty similar answers.  In contrast, with Trump, there are just so many different kinds of blatant misconduct, that there’s surprisingly little overlap.  I recently heard <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sam Harris&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:2045807,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b54c524-760d-4aeb-a2ee-d8ee40e0563a_635x635.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;6a34e9a1-0e25-4e24-8368-818f4073090d&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBEu3Om1u4M">Triggernometry podcast</a> recount his problems with Trump, and learned about a number of misbehaviors that I’d never heard before.  </p><p>Scandals that would destroy any other president are a daily occurrence.  Daily, we see headlines like “Trump threatens Greenland with nuclear war,” “Trump is gifted a free jet from Qatar,” and “Trump gets billions of dollars in crypto from the UAE and then right after makes an AI deal with the UAE.”  The last two, by the way, are real! </p><p>For this reason, I thought I’d lay out, simply and concisely, my five biggest problems with the Trump administration—and why <a href="https://thingofthings.substack.com/p/donation-recommendations-for-effective">defeating him politically</a> should be a top priority.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </p><h1>1 Foreign aid cuts </h1><p>The most immediately disastrous Trump policy has been cutting foreign aid.  The death toll so far has likely been <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/update-lives-lost-usaid-cuts">between 500,000 and a million</a>, more than the Iraq war.  The future death toll from canceled contracts is likely greater.  This means Trump’s foreign aid cuts are responsible for about <em>1% of global deaths</em>.  They have also damaged our soft-power and destabilized the world, harming America long-term.  </p><p>The defenses of this policy do not hold up.  It isn’t justified to cut foreign aid based on reducing costs because: </p><ol><li><p>Foreign aid is a tiny sliver of the budget, below 1%.  </p></li><li><p>America benefits from foreign aid in that in makes the world more peaceful and stable, and it boosts American softpower.  </p></li></ol><p>The moral argument that a nation should only serve its own interests so we shouldn’t provide foreign aid is wrong because: </p><ol><li><p>It ludicrously implies that we’d have no moral reason to intervene in Rwanda to stop the genocide, where </p></li>...</ol>
