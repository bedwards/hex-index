I would like to sincerely apologize for my newsletters being less frequent in the past few months. I have been working on some exciting projects which I will announce soon. In the meantime, the newsletter will be back with more regularity and I’m hoping to really focus on the topics that are most interesting and most helpful to YOU as a parent so give me some feedback and let me know what you want! Today’s newsletters will be on one of my most requested topics— the research behind rewards for children! </em></p><p>Sticker charts, earning something special for “good behavior,” and paying children an allowance for completing chores have long been common practice among parents.

What does research really find about rewards? </p><h3><strong>The Anti-Reward Movement</strong></h3><p>The crusade against rewards was initially spearheaded by author and gentle parenting icon, Alfie Kohn. [An interesting side note is that Alfie Kohn also led the crusade against the phrase “good job”.]  In 1993, Alfie Kohn wrote a book titled <em>Punished by Rewards: The Trouble with Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise, and Other Bribes</em>. In this book, Kohn claims that rewards are “useless” and “counterproductive” because rewards ultimately make children lose interest in what you are rewarding them for and they become motivated only by the reward rather than the task itself. In other words, he argued that when you provide <strong>external motivation</strong> (such as rewards) children lose internal or <strong>intrinsic motivation</strong>.
