data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>, titled “<a href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2024/11/actually-existing-postliberalism">Actually Existing Postliberalism</a>,” that I think is one of the most intellectually important pieces to be published in some time, and which I’ll go out of my way to recommend here. &nbsp;</p><p>It is essentially a detailed account of how and why the United States government decided it needed to surveil and control the bank accounts and financial transactions of the entire world in the name of fighting terrorism — and then authoritarianism… and then the hazy universal evil of “hate.” More generally, it’s the story of how Western liberalism’s former <a href="https://theupheaval.substack.com/p/on-public-private-partnership">separation of public and private spheres of life was torn down</a>, thrusting us into our current hellscape of technocratic “global governance,” in which dissidents are liable to find themselves <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/debanking-america-melania-barron-trump-january-6-muslims">debanked</a> from the financial system in the name of inclusion.</p><p>With this account Pinkoski fills in some important gaps in the record by identifying and documenting some of the key figures and decisions-points that led us to where we are now. In particular, he expertly reveals just how bipartisan the scheme to transform national “government” into global “governance” was, with the twin “neoliberal” and “neoconservative” sides of American politics working hand-in-hand to advance the same ambitious revolution after the end of the Cold War.</p><p>This includes uncovering some rather spectacular facts and quotes that I at least was unaware of, such as an open declaration by Bill Clinton’s National Security Advisor that America’s post-Cold War strategy would be to “pursue our goals through an enlarged circle not only of government officials but also of private and non-governmental groups,” including “private firms” and “human rights groups,” in order to fight the “intolerant energies of racism” across the planet and isolate “backlash states” “diplomatically, militarily, economically, and technologically.” Which is exactly the foreign policy chimera we got and still labor under decades later.</p><p>Or the fact that it was not some shadowy cabal of Blackrock and the UN that first invented manipulative “environmental, social, and governance” (ESG) investing standards, but the George W. Bush administration’s national security staff, who noted that private finance “could drive the isolation of rogue entities more effectively than governments” and predicted that “the banks will fall into line” once “our campaigns leveraged the power of this kind of reputational risk.”</p><p>Or the timely reminder that in 1989 the supposedly conservative <em>Wall Street Journal</em> </p>...</source>
