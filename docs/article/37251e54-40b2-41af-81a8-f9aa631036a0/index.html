        <p class="topic-summary">Foxconn is the archetypal example of a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that became indispensable to Western tech giants, particularly Apple. Its history of vertical integration, scale, and the challenges companies face in diversifying away from it directly parallels Meta&#039;s current situation with Goertek, offering instructive context on electronics manufacturing dependency.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Goertek is &#039;the world&#039;s top supplier of MEMS acoustic sensors&#039;—a critical component in AR/VR devices for spatial audio and voice input. Understanding MEMS technology explains why these microscale components require specialized manufacturing expertise that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, Meta announced that they would pause the international rollout of their Ray Ban Display AR glasses to focus on fulfilling US orders due to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/meta-delays-global-rollout-ray-ban-display-glasses-strong-us-demand-supply-2026-01-06/">extremely limited inventory.</a> But the component shortages Meta is facing are especially acute, in part because of the company’s ongoing quest to reduce reliance on one particular Chinese supplier.</p><p>In September, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b397f80d-5772-483b-9e48-b9fa83279c75">FT reported</a> that Meta was struggling to decouple from Goertek, the Shandong-based electronics giant that assembles Meta’s Quest headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. In that article, Hannah Murphy and Eleanor Olcott wrote that Goertek supplies “some components” for Meta, quoting a Meta representative who told FT, “We have a robust, diversified supply chain so we’re not solely dependent on any one manufacturer, and we’re constantly reviewing and exploring supply chain opportunities around the world.”</p><p>But what scale of dependence are we talking about exactly?

Instead, most information comes from <strong>teardowns</strong>, in which a third-party disassembles a headset purchased off the shelf to analyze its components. I have analyzed the publicly available information (including teardowns and official Goertek findings), but this analysis is my own. I take responsibility for any inaccuracies and welcome corrections from anyone with insider information!</em></p><h2>What does Goertek do?</h2><p>Goertek 歌尔股份 is the world’s largest XR Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) company, meaning they are the world’s largest manufacturer of AR and VR headsets. Jiang Bin 姜滨, Goertek’s co-founder and chairman, appeared at Xi’s business symposium in February alongside the founders of DeepSeek and Unitree. Here’s a refresher on the company’s history from <a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/xis-hard-tech-avengers">my write-up</a> of that symposium:</p><blockquote><p>Jiang Bin is the chairman of Goertek, a company he co-founded with his wife, Hu Shuangmei 胡双美, in 2001. Goertek is one of the primary manufacturers of Apple’s AirPods and Vision Pro headsets.</p><p>Jiang Bin was born in 1966 in Shandong province. He earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and later an </p></blockquote>...</source>
