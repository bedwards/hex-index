        <p><em>“From Birzeit University, in the heart of occupied Palestine, we are screaming with Gaza. We need everyone from Palestine, the Arab nations, and the peoples of the world to amplify the cry of Gaza…. Palestinians no longer need to offer proof of the enemy’s savagery – the dead neither provide nor require evidence. The bodies of the living – of the displaced, besieged, sick, wounded, hungry, and thirsty – still resist, driven by a will to live. The genocidal will of the Zionist state, however, has not stopped at starvation; it went further by turning food into a weapon through death traps disguised as ‘aid distribution.’… The shame borne from the world’s failure in the face of Gaza’s starvation must become the shame of shame itself – to erase the disgrace of complicity with genocidal will, and to initiate saving Gaza as a step toward saving our shared humanity, which has suffered greatly from the continuation of this genocide.” </em>Union of Teachers and Employees of Birzeit University, Occupied Palestine, July 24, 2025.*</p><p>To hear the wisdom of these words is to scream with Gaza. </p><p>Screaming <em>with</em>. </p><p><strong>Solidarity is a scream.</strong> </p><p>A long piercing sound.

The brutality of power for all to see.</p><p>The “shame of shame itself,” to hear the wisdom of these words is to commit to action.</p><p>To commit to using what we have, our voices, our resources, our materials; whatever is to hand, to be of use, to get behind it, everything behind it, that scream, long and loud and piercing, as long as it takes, saying <em>no</em> to business as usual, combining our forces, doing what has to be done to stop genocide, stop the starving of Gaza, where even “food is a weapon,” where a search for sustenance, however small, to avoid death, risks death.</p><p>There are no words for this. It is beyond evil, even.</p><p>You might feel powerless. That it is too ...</p>
