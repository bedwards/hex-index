        <p>When asked about the cost of their government’s support of the State of Israel, some Americans will say it’s $3.8 billion a year — the amount of annual military aid the United States is committed to under its current, 10-year “memorandum of understanding” with Israel. However, that answer massively understates the true cost of the relationship, not only because it doesn’t capture various, vast expenditures springing from it, but even more so because the relationship’s steepest costs can’t be measured in dollars.  </p><p>Since its 1948 founding, Israel has been far and away the largest recipient of American foreign assistance. Though the Ukraine war created a brief anomaly, Israel generally tops the list every year, despite the fact that <a href="https://gfmag.com/data/richest-countries-in-the-world/">Israel is among the world’s richest countries</a> — ranked three spots below the UK and two spots above Japan in per capita GDP. Driving that point home, even when using the grossly-understating <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-israel/">$3.8 billion</a> figure for US expenditures on Israel, America gave the Zionist state $404 per <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/israel/#people-and-society">person</a> in the 2023 fiscal year, compared to just <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/06/what-the-data-says-about-us-foreign-aid/">$15</a> per <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ethiopia/#people-and-society">person</a> for Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries on Earth and America’s third-largest beneficiary that year. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg" width="1456" height="913" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:913,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:202857,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://starkrealities.substack.com/i/167024376?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vSkN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff975b8a2-4b5c-46e6-8fcf-4359f4aeb6e4_1588x996.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts">Council on Foreign Relations</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Israel’s cumulative post-World War II haul has been nearly <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts">double</a> that of runner-up Egypt. What most Americans don’t realize, however, is that much of Egypt’s take — $1.4 billion in 2023 — should be chalked up to Israel too, because of ongoing US aid commitments rising from the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/3/why-us-aid-to-egypt-is-never-under-threat">1978 Camp David Accords</a> that brokered peace between Egypt and Israel. The same can be said for Jordan — America’s <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/06/what-the-data-says-about-us-foreign-aid/">fourth-largest</a> beneficiary in fiscal 2023 at $1.7 billion. US aid to the kingdom surged after it signed its own <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/12/egypt-jordan-and-the-us-aid-game">1994 treaty</a> with Israel, and a wedge of Jordan’s aid is intended to address the country’s large refugee population, comprising not only Palestinians displaced by Israel’s creation, but also masses who’ve fled US-led regime-change wars pursued on Israel’s behalf.  </p><p>Then there’s the supplemental aid to Israel that Congress periodically authorizes on top of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) commitment. Since the October 7 Hamas invasion of Israel, these supplements have exceeded the MOU commitment by leaps and bounds. In just the first year of the war in Gaza, Congress and President Biden approved <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2023/2024/Costs%20of%20War_US%20Support%20Since%20Oct%207%20FINAL%20v2.pdf">an additional $14.1 billion</a> in “emergency” military aid to Israel, bringing the total for that year to $17.9 billion.   </p><p>One must also consider </p>...</source>
