Of course, you’ll see nothing about it anywhere in the rest of our vaunted media landscape, and since so many people out there in internet La La Land are clearly desperate for a “coverup” they can enjoyably rage about, let me go ahead and satisfy your cravings:</p><p>Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York found the marquee Epstein “survivor,” <a href="https://www.mtracey.net/p/we-need-to-talk-about-virginia">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a>, also known as VRG, to be so lacking in credibility that they were impelled to compose a lengthy December 19, 2019 memo detailing the many preposterous flaws with her many fantastical tales.</p><p>— They said they were “unable to corroborate” the central claim of VRG’s purported victimization, which had also given rise to the very essence of Epstein mythology as we now know it: that she was “lent out” for sexual services to prominent men, such as Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz.</p><p>— They noted that VRG’s accounts of her own sexual abuse were “internally inconsistent,” and not just over long periods of time, but <em>within a single interview</em> they conducted with her on September 9, 2019.</p><p>— They noted that VRG admitted to repeatedly lying about basic facts, destroying evidence, and telling falsehoods to the media.</p><p>— They noted that VRG schemed with a tabloid trash journalist, Sharon Churcher of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, to generate “big headlines” by accusing lots of prominent people of heinous child-sex crimes, in hopes that this would entice prospective publishers to buy their forthcoming “memoir” for big bucks.</p><p>— They noted that VRG claimed the FBI had told her they were aware of “40 other Epstein victims,” but the FBI never told her any such thing.</p><p>— They noted that VRG had falsely claimed the FBI told her “Epstein had cameras watching her at all times,” and repeated this tantalizing claim to the media, but the FBI never told her any such thing. And indeed, they were “not aware of any such cameras.”</p><p>— They noted that VRG became “particularly combative” when asked for specific details of her claims, at one point cursing at the Assistant US Attorneys when they requested </p>...</source>
