        <p>Hi All,</p><p>The Trump administration did a great favor to Ukraine and all of Europe this week. It stopped lying publicly about its position on both and made it all but impossible for European leaders to keep fantasizing about the USA riding to the rescue. In fact, if you look at the new US National Security Strategy, it is clear that Europe is now viewed as more threatening to the USA in Trump’s mind than either Russia or even China. Here is a free piece about just how focussed the Trump administration is on destroying today’s Europe.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;015f64d4-ea56-4f58-a43c-bd282667bbb1&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Hi All,&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The New US National Security Strategy&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:109940878,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Phillips P.

That was the date, if you do not remember, on which Donald Trump was elected to his second term. It was also the date on which too many Europeans (and Americans) wilfully suspended disbelief and started living on hope. And it was a hope that the Trump and his acolytes fed effectively at regular intervals with disastrous results. I will give one great example in the update, the Tomahawk con. This was a deliberate effort by the Trump administration to make people believe something would happen to hurt Russia/help Ukraine—something that HAD NO CHANCE OF EVER HAPPENING.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!x6vz!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg" width="480" height="359" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/115d8bcf-19db-4703-8c71-1ff2df8ff98d_480x359.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:359,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A Tactical 'Tomahawk' Block IV cruise missile conducts a controlled flight test over the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) western test range complex in southern California.

The truth is now being so starkly revealed that it can or at least should no longer be denied.</p><p>This truth was not just because of the new National Security Strategy of the USA. It was the new National Security Strategy coming hot on the heels of the 28-point plan and the fact that the Trump administration has been working closely with Putin’s Russia for months to come up ways to enrich Trump and his circle. And finally there was the fact that in the midst of all this Vladimir Putin was confident enough in his relationship with/the loyalty of, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/04/g-s1-100609/putin-ukraine-russia-war-us-peace-plan">that he rejected any peace deal at the moment and clearly expected </a></p>...</source>
