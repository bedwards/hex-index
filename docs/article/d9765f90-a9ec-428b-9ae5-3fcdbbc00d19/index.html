        <p class="topic-summary">The novel is deeply rooted in Bethlehem&#039;s geography and German-Moravian heritage. Elizabeth explicitly notes she feels Dresden will be &#039;like Bethlehem&#039; because &#039;Bethlehem was built by Germans.&#039; Understanding this post-industrial Steel Belt city&#039;s unique founding by Moravian settlers and its decline provides essential context for the characters&#039; working-class origins and psychological landscape.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Bethlehem, Pennsylvania was founded as a Moravian settlement, and the novel&#039;s themes of inherited spiritual aspirations, guilt, and the tension between pragmatism and transcendence echo Moravian theological traditions. The characters&#039; neurotic self-examination and pursuit of meaning beyond material success reflects this Protestant pietist heritage.</p>

Understanding Vassar&#039;s history as an elite women&#039;s college turned coeducational, and its reputation for intellectual intensity and artistic temperament, illuminates the social world these young would-be poets inhabit.</p>

As Stephen and Elizabeth grow from precocious children into neurotic artists in their thirties, Matthew Gasda reveals how post-industrial, late 20th century America created a generation too intelligent for ordinary happiness, too self-aware for decisive action: suspended between the working-class pragmatism of their fathers and the creative and spiritual aspirations of their mothers, capable of everything except building lives.</em></p><p><em>Matthew Gasda is the founder of the Brooklyn Center for Theater Research and the author of many books, including the recent novel The Sleepers and Writer’s Diary.</em></p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p>Elizabeth read Boettner’s letters to her brother zealously and jealously. When she was done reading (she had read every word, trying even to memorize some sections on the fly), Elizabeth carefully put the letters back where she found them, and thought with satisfaction, that there was no way for her brother to know, or to prove, that she ever removed to them to read them; she would never tell him (under no circumstances would she tell him).</p><p>She found the way the two young men talked about art and literature intuitively irritating and infuriating; no one had given them the right to think this way about themselves. They had elected themselves poets and seers. And the two young men would later become poets. Why not?</p><p>Boettner had divided his affections and his passions so evenly in such a gendered way.
