        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions a &#039;notable recurring proposal&#039; in Chinese commentary to &#039;play the Ryukyu card&#039; by supporting Okinawa-based indigenous and anti-base claims as leverage over Japan. Understanding the historical and contemporary Ryukyu independence movement provides crucial context for this geopolitical strategy.</p>

Her apparent readiness to loosen Japan’s “Three Non-Nuclear Principles” is treated with particular alarm.</p><p>Several authors tie her language back to the 1930s, arguing that invoking an impending “existential crisis” (存亡危机) to justify external aggression is a habitual trick of Japanese militarism. Across the spectrum — from People’s Daily’s “Zhong Sheng” editorials to think-tank scholars and fringe commentators — Takaichi’s remarks are framed as evidence of a dangerous shift towards Japanese remilitarisation and “historical revisionism” (历史修正主义) ...</p>
