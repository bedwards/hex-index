        <p><em>Please note that I updated this guide on 2/15, less than a month after writing it - a lot has changed in a short time.</em></p><p>While my <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/prophecies-of-the-flood">last post</a> explored the race for Artificial General Intelligence – a topic recently thrust into headlines by Apollo Program-scale funding commitments to building new AIs – today I'm tackling the one question I get asked most: what AI should you actually use? Not five years from now. Not in some hypothetical future. Today.</p><p>Every six months or so, I have written an opinionated guide for individual users of AI, not specializing in any one type of use, but as a general overview. Writing this is getting more challenging. AI models are gaining capabilities at an increasingly rapid rate, new companies are releasing new models, and nothing is well documented or well understood. In fact, in the few days I have been working on this draft, I had to add an entirely new model and update the chart below multiple times due to new releases. As a result, I may get something wrong, or you may disagree with my answers, but that is why I consider it an opinionated guide (though as a reminder, I take no money from AI labs, so it is my opinion!)</p><h1>A Tour of Capabilities</h1><p>To pick an AI model for you, you need to know what they can do. I decided to focus here on the major AI companies that offer easy-to-use apps that you can run on your phone, and which allow you to access their most up-to-date AI models. Right now, to consistently access a frontier model with a good app, you are going to need to pay around $20/month (at least in the US), with a couple exceptions. Yes, there are free tiers, but you'll generally want paid access to get the most capable versions of these models.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png" width="1456" height="496" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:496,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:106128,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dh7u!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd5798b6-1107-40ba-905b-f987861acff4_1512x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>We are going to go through things in detail, but, for most people, there are three good choices right now: <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude </a>from Anthropic, Google’s <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>, and OpenAI’s <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>.
