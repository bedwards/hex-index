        <p>Like many other academics, I have stopped using Twitter. I haven’t properly transitioned to another social media platform because the energy required to re-build “an audience” exceeds what I can realistically engage with at this stage of my life. The need for it has also diminished for me compared to the past, especially as a young academic. Bluesky seems like a promising alternative, but I’ve yet to invest time in it, and I’m not sure I really want to. But since Twitter played a non-negligible role in my professional and, if I’m honest, personal life for about a decade, I thought it would be fitting to write a brief post-mortem of my relationship with it.

I joined it to follow news and updates from people I didn’t know personally but found interesting, and to occasionally share ideas or research with a broader audience. My follower count grew significantly after I published a blog post titled <em>“Why Academia Resembles a Drug Gang.”</em> Despite its somewhat clickbaity title, the piece delved into an analysis of the dualization of the academic job market. The blog went viral, and sharing it on Twitter brought me a substantial number of new followers.</p><p>As an academic, Twitter felt like a way to reach a wider audience more directly and immediately than traditional channels, such as newspaper op-eds, which often involved significant ...</p>
