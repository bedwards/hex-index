      <p>This week Chad, Brian, and Kaija talk about the midwest as hell, locusts and tornados, one’s family and attempts to escape it, forms of love found in the book, aging (as always), History and history, Rilke, whether or not we “know” Kohler, and much more. It’s a fun, illuminating episode covering a section that, despite the exploding glass and wind, is a bit slower and more focused than the previous two.</p><p>This episode’s music is “Whirring” by The Joy Formidable. </p><p><span>Next week we’ll cover the second section, “We Have Not Lived the Right Life” (pages 49–146).
