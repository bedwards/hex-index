        <p class="topic-summary">This podcast episode is a deep-dive discussion of William H. Gass&#039;s experimental novel &#039;The Tunnel,&#039; discussing character Kohler, themes of history, and the Midwest setting. Understanding the novel&#039;s significance in postmodern American literature would enrich the listening experience.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Rilke is explicitly mentioned as a discussion point in the episode. The German-language poet&#039;s influence on modernist literature and his philosophical explorations of solitude and existence likely connect to themes in Gass&#039;s work.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Understanding the author of &#039;The Tunnel&#039; - his philosophy of language, his role in American experimental fiction, and his 26-year process writing this novel - provides essential context for appreciating the podcast&#039;s literary analysis.</p>

      <p>This week Chad, Brian, and Kaija talk about the midwest as hell, locusts and tornados, one’s family and attempts to escape it, forms of love found in the book, aging (as always), History and history, Rilke, whether or not we “know” Kohler, and much more. It’s a fun, illuminating episode covering a section that, despite the exploding glass and wind, is a bit slower and more focused than the previous two.</p><p>This episode’s music is “Whirring” by The Joy Formidable. </p><p><span>Next week we’ll cover the second section, “We Have Not Lived the Right Life” (pages 49–146).
