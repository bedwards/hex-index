        <p><em>“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”</em></p><p><em>Charlie Munger, 1989 Wesco Financial Annual Letter (<a href="https://www.safalniveshak.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Charlie-Munger-Wesco-Letters-1983-1995.pdf">page 87</a>)</em></p><p>In August 1981, Dean Williams of Batterymarch Financial Management gave a speech at a financial analysts conference titled “<a href="https://alphaarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Williams-Trying_too_Hard.pdf">Trying Too Hard</a>”. Among many useful ideas presented by Williams, I was particularly drawn to this one: “The last of the mental qualities we talked about was consistency... and how it seemed present in nearly all outstanding investment records... <strong>Simplicity or singleness of approach is a greatly underestimated factor of success</strong>.”</p><p>Simplicity can be an uncomfortable idea in the world of investing, particularly as it relates to the <em>business</em> of investing. One notable way that it surfaces is security / fund selection, an example of which I saw recently when a family member asked me for some thoughts on an account that was being managed by a large investment advisory firm. The portfolio consisted of a complex web of about 25 different funds, many of which had portfolio weightings of &lt;3%. </p><p>Its construction signaled great thought and effort - yet the portfolio, over the long run, was highly unlikely to generate returns that diverged from those delivered by a sensibly constructed portfolio with three or four index funds (before considering the elevated expense ratios on many of the ~25 funds). <a href="https://collabfund.com/blog/trying-too-hard/">To paraphrase Morgan Housel</a>, it’s likely the best answer for my family member would’ve been if the individual managing the portfolio did next to <em>nothing</em> - but their career incentives encouraged them to do <em>something</em>.</p><p>Beyond security and fund selection, asset allocation is another area where simplicity is often meet with suspicion; a structural approach, with weightings largely fixed outside of periodic rebalancing, lacks the apparent sophistication of big swings in / out of equities (i.e. market timing). The past 15+ years have revealed the danger that lurks here; a particularly notable example is from Seth Klarman, who said the following at the CFA Institute Conference <a href="https://www.questinvest.com/pdf/Seth-Klarman-CFA-Presentation.pdf">in May 2010</a>: “I am worried about the world, more broadly, than I’ve ever been in my career... <strong>Given the recent run-up, I am worried we will have another ten years of, if not zero, at least very low returns from today’s valuations</strong>.”</p><p>In hindsight, the S&amp;P 500 bested Klarman’s prediction by ...</p>
