        <p class="topic-summary">The article uses &#039;Sisyphean&#039; to describe the endless nature of housework. Understanding the Greek myth of Sisyphus—condemned to roll a boulder uphill for eternity—and its philosophical interpretations by Camus and others adds depth to this metaphor about domestic labor</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The author describes her &#039;Pavlovian sense of calm&#039; when vacuuming. Understanding Pavlov&#039;s actual experiments and how classical conditioning works neurologically illuminates why repetitive cleaning behaviors can become genuinely soothing responses</p>

Our plan was to meet at my place at noon, and then he showed up thirty minutes ahead of schedule. “You’re early. I need to tidy up, <em>it’s a mess</em>,” I lamented like some kind of 1950s fridge-magnet lady come to life. It wasn’t. Messy, that is. I just hadn’t had time to do a pre-company spit polish. And now here was my dear pal, standing in my kitchen, and I was spinning out over coffee rings. As we hugged, I surveyed the dishes in the sink from over his shoulder, the high chair caked with egg-something, the bowl on the butcher’s block overflowing with the flotsam and jetsam of everyday existence. I wasn’t embarrassed. It was more like a visceral discomfort, like this reunion I had been looking forward to was somehow diminished against an imperfect backdrop.</p><p>My friend was unfazed: “You live here, don’t you?” he said, shrug-smirking in a way that suggested maybe he hadn’t flown for almost twenty-four hours to spend time with quartz countertops. For him, it was a throwaway comment. My daughter barrelled in—a tornado of snot and sand and uncapped magic markers—and we got on with our day.</p><p>But for me, his words landed like a transgressive truth bomb, a much-needed reminder that chasing picture perfect in the domestic sphere is absurd. Like going to a barnyard and being disappointed by the smells. <em>You live here</em>—as in, this is a home, not an <em>Architectural Digest</em> photo shoot or house porn on social media. <em>You live here</em>—as in, meeting the needs of three people who eat and sleep and do laundry and leave toothpaste spray all over the bathroom vanity every day is a messy business. <em>You live here</em>—as in, life is precious and short and rare, and not one single person ever said on their deathbed, “I wish I had spent more time with my Swiffer.”</p><p>So why can’t I stop stress-cleaning?</p><p>It’s a serious question, if not one I ever thought I’d be asking myself. I am not a naturally tidy person. My brain tends toward the chaotic, and so does my T-shirt drawer. On vacation, I am the friend whose suitcase explodes over the shared room. But more and more, I have found myself tidying </p>...</source>
