and the two leaders took no questions at what was initially billed as a joint press conference.</p><p>While Putin referred obliquely to an “agreement” that had been reached, Trump said that while they had made progress, there were still some points of dispute.</p><p>“We didn’t get there, but we have a good shot of getting there,” Trump said, calling it a very productive meeting.</p><p>“There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said. “I will call up NATO…and [European leaders] and of course call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting. It’s ultimately up to them.”</p><p><em><strong>Putin: Still need to eliminate ‘primary causes’ of the war</strong></em></p><p>Putin in his remarks indicated that he was still determined to eradicate what he called the “primary roots” of the conflict, rather than agree to a short-term ceasefire of Russia’s full fledged invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>“We’re convinced that in order to make the settlement lasting long term, we need to eliminate all the primary roots, the primary causes of the conflict </p>...</source>
