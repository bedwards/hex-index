        <p>The most paradoxical thing about creative work is that it is both a way in and a way out, that it plunges you into the depths of your being and at the same time takes you out of yourself. Writing is the best instrument I have for metabolizing my experience and clarifying my own mind in such a way that I am no longer captive to it. All creative work is at bottom a means of self-liberation and a coping mechanism — for the loneliness, the despair, the chaos and contradiction within. It is the best means we have of transmuting that which gnaws at us into something that nourishes, and yet how little of that private ferment is visible in the finished work. </p>
<p>This is why I <a href="https://themarginalian.org/tag/diaries">love diaries</a>, with their rare glimpse of the inner worlds that lavish our own with beauty and truth, with nourishment of substance and sweetness that endures for epochs after the lives that made it are no more. </p>
<p>Of all the writers and artists who have kept a journal as <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/09/04/famous-writers-on-keeping-a-diary/">a means of creative catalysis</a> and <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/02/john-steinbeck-working-days/">a salve for self-doubt</a>, no one has confronted the internal saboteur of creativity — those psychic hindrances that stand between the talented and the fruition of their talent — more pointedly than <strong>Franz Kafka</strong> (July 3, 1883–June 3, 1924). </p>

<p>“I won’t give up the diary again. I must hold on here, it is the only place I can,” he vows at the outset of his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Diaries-Franz-1910-1923-Schocken-Library/dp/0805209069/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Diaries: 1910–1923</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/183927241" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — the journal that became part creative sandbox, part metronome of discipline, part exorcism for self-doubt as Kafka was trying to live into his creative calling while working as an insurance salesman. “I want to write, with a constant trembling on my forehead,” he declares, and yet over and over he indicts himself for falling short of his desire, for thwarting his talent with insecurity and lack of discipline. “Wrote nothing,” he laments in entry after entry. “Have written nothing for three days,” he sulks as his creative block consumes him. “Bad,” he declares a perfect spring day for having produced no writing. By early summer, he is in despair:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing written for so long. Begin tomorrow. Otherwise I shall again get into a prolonged, irresistible dissatisfaction; I am really in it already. The nervous states are beginning. But if I can </p>...</blockquote>
