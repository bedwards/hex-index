      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Epistemic status: largely just an excuse to quote a bunch of polemical passages I’ve enjoyed. </p><p>By disposition, I love polemicism.  There is little I enjoy more than a good literary smackdown.  Even when I substantively disagree with the writer, I find there to be something awe-inspiring about good polemics.  Even people whose arguments I am often unimpressed by, I enjoy a little too much so long as the polemicism is good.  Though I generally do not find David Bentley Hart’s arguments good—in part because he rarely seems particularly interested in making them—I find him delightful to read for the disses.  <a href="https://firstthings.com/gods-and-gopniks/">For example</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Did Gopnik bother to read what he was writing there? I ask only because it is so colossally silly. If my dog were to utter such words, I should be deeply disappointed in my dog’s powers of reasoning. If my salad at lunch were suddenly to deliver itself of such an opinion, my only thought would be “What a very stupid salad.” Before all else, there is the preposterous temerity of the proprietary claim; it is like some fugitive from a local asylum appearing at the door to tell you that “all this realm” is his inalienable feudal appanage and that you must evacuate the premises forthwith.</p></blockquote><p>Or <a href="https://afkimel.wordpress.com/2020/07/21/the-edward-feser-algorithm-how-to-review-a-book-you-have-not-read/">alternatively</a>: </p><blockquote><p>I know I have a predilection for writing prose rather than bullet-points, and this may have confused Feser; but his misstatements are so bizarre and extravagant that there are only two possibilities: either he did not actually read the book, but at most skimmed bits of it in his rush to write a review he had already concocted in his mind while doing something else (kicking a puppy, perhaps); or he is, when reading a complex text that has not been carefully explained to him several times in advance, damned near a functional illiterate. Of course, both things may be true at once, but I believe the former to be unarguably true in this case.</p></blockquote><p>I even enjoyed<a href="https://davidbentleyhart.substack.com/p/a-bark-without-a-bite"> Hart’s criticisms of me</a>, which some might say is indicative of a darkened mind: </p><blockquote><p>The second experience, which was slightly more irksome, involved someone sending me links to <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/benthams/p/is-continental-philosophy-unclear?r=cyx9j&amp;utm_medium=ios">some Substack articles</a> by a fellow going by the moniker ‘Bentham’s Bulldog’, proclaiming in a tone of bluffing bombast that, while ‘analytic’ philosophers make arguments and write clearly and are held to standards of logical solvency, ‘continental’ philosophers merely make </p>...</blockquote>
