Here’s a few editorial reviews from people I truly respect on the matter:</p><h2><strong>The Endorsements That Laid Me Out</strong></h2><blockquote><p>“I have had a lot of fathers in faith, but never a mother—at least until I met Sarah Bessey. Now she is the writer I recommend to anyone who needs to be seen, loved, and held before they ever say why. Reading her new book is like opening a boxed lunch in the wilderness packed by someone who knew just what would get you through—along with a note that says, ‘Your soul is just fine.’ The only difference is that this book keeps feeding you after you have finished the last page (the one you hoped would never come). Take heart! You can start all over again whenever you want, safe in the embrace of a very wise mum.”<strong>—Barbara Brown Taylor, author of </strong><em><strong>An Altar in the World</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Learning to Walk in the Dark</strong></em><br><br>“Sarah Bessey shines. A book full of gentle wisdom and stunning empathy for all those of us who are bruised by the faithful but want to keep our faith. Faithful without being pious. Useful without being bossy. This is the perfect guide for all those of who need to be reintroduced to a faith full of grace, mercy, and love.”<strong>—Kate Bowler, </strong><em><strong>New York Times </strong></em><strong>bestselling author of </strong><em><strong>Good Enough</strong></em><br><br>“In a time when so many of us feel like we are spiritual wanderers, Sarah Bessey reaches out a hand and offers wise and careful company on the journey. Through the tenderness and intimacy of letters, this book shows us the many ways we might survive together in the liminal.”<strong>—Cole Arthur Riley, </strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong> bestselling author of </strong><em><strong>This Here Flesh</strong></em><strong> and creator of Black Liturgies</strong><br><br>“If you forced me to pick one book in the whole world to walk someone gently through their faith evolution—one writer, one thinker, one human being out of all the marvelous leaders who’ve done this hard </p></blockquote>...</source>
