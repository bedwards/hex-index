        <p>It’s been a while since I stepped foot in a casino, but my memories span four continents. My journey through the gambling world started at The Golden Nugget in London – where I managed to get banned. Not for anything glamorous like card counting or hiding a computer in my shoe. No, my crime was abusing the free parking privileges. With central London parking costs as high as they were, most of my bets had positive expected value – an outcome that didn’t win me favour with casino management.</p><p>My attempts to beat the house proved equally inept in Cairo, where I came close to blowing myself up with a Martingale strategy at the roulette wheel. After doubling down through six straight losses, the croupier looked at me with genuine concern. “Are you sure you want to proceed?” he asked, his voice carrying the weight of someone who’d watched this story end badly many times before.

It seems I’m not alone. Just 3.1 million people visited Vegas in July, down 12% from a year ago, marking the sixth straight month of declining visitors. Although numbers have risen from the depths of Covid, they haven’t regained their pre-pandemic peak. It’s the same in Macau, which welcomed 35 million tourists in 2024, down from 39 million in 2019.</p><p>Last week, one casino stock felt the brunt of this trend. Caesars Entertainment was dropped from the S&amp;P 500 index to be replaced by Robinhood. The committee that oversees the benchmark’s composition doesn’t dwell much on narrative.
