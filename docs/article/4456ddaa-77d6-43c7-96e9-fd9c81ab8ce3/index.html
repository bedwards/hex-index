        <p>Quick, personal question…</p><p><strong>How many yearly goals have seemingly slipped through your fingers?</strong></p><p>Too many to count? If so, I need you to know something…</p><p>You’re far from alone. And I’ve certainly been there before.&nbsp;</p><p>This dance isn’t alien to me. It goes something like this:</p><p>You set a big, ambitious yearly goal. You’re excited to land some big successes under your belt. Yet, when the time comes?</p><p>… You find yourself with no victory, only sorrow-filled defeat.&nbsp;</p><p>(Followed by a not-so-fun puddle of guilt and regret.)</p><p>If you’re in an unnerving place where big goals keep getting lost in the fog, I urge you to listen closely…&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It’s not your fault…</strong></p><p><strong>Your problem is NOT the goals…or your level of ambition.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Your real issue is the </strong><em><strong>timeframe</strong></em><strong> you plan to achieve them.</strong></p><p>I’ll explain:</p><p>This is the “yearly planning fallacy.”</p><p>Since we’ve been kids, we’ve been told to set yearly goals.</p><p>January 1st rolls around…and we get ambitious.</p><p>… But that momentary ambition never turns to fruition.</p><p>It’s a lie.</p><p>Why? That dreamy goal you have in your head almost always gets lost in the ether when life inevitably rags you around.</p><p>Here’s the good news…</p><p>If you stop pulling on the “yearly goal ‘lever” and start pulling this different one… you’ll soon be achieving all of your goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Even more:</p><p>You can put yourself in a position where you will get more done in 90 days than most do in 2 years.</p><p>How so?</p><p>Over the past 10 years, I’ve published bestselling books, scored strong success in my consulting company, and coached hundreds of professionals and entrepreneurs…</p><p>… Not because I’ve set yearly goals, but because of the systems I use.</p><p>It’s directly responsible for every deadline I’ve met and every goal I’ve hit.</p><p>What’s this system? It’s simple 90 day planning…</p><p>Where you achieve BIG goals in 90 day bursts.</p><p>Each 90 day sprint is made up of just 4 powerful components.</p><p>This tried-and-tested system keeps you in absolute control of your life — and keeps you firmly on track for the next 90 days.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s great and hundreds of people are using it right now.</p><p>Normally this isn’t available for public purchase, however, right now you can get your hands on it…</p><p>How? Inside the new <strong>Elite Performers Celebration sale.</strong></p><p>Which is, unfortunately, going away soon…</p><p>Let’s be honest:&nbsp;</p><p>Accomplishing yearly goals is the equivalent of ...</p>
