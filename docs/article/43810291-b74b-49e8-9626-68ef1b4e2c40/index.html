        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses dismantling ED but assumes readers know its history. Understanding when and why it was created (1979 under Carter), its controversial origins, and previous attempts to abolish it provides essential context for evaluating current reform proposals.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Spellings is quoted as a key voice in the article. As George W. Bush&#039;s Secretary of Education who implemented No Child Left Behind, her perspective on ED reorganization carries particular weight that readers would better appreciate knowing her background.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Multiple commentators express concern about the Charter Schools Program moving to the Department of Labor. Understanding charter school governance, funding mechanisms, and their contested relationship with teachers unions illuminates why this transfer is controversial.</p>

        <p>Hi, gang. I was planning to continue our conversation about blue-state education reform today, but current events intervened. Instead, I round up the reactions to the Trump administration’s decision to send various ED offices hither and yon. Commentaries come from luminaries including Margaret Spellings, Denise Forte, Kevin Huffman, Nina Rees, Checker Finn, Starlee Coleman, Kevin Carey, Ashley Jochim, Rebecca Sibilia, Jed Wallace, Chad Aldeman, Andy Rotherham, Rick Hess, and Adam Kissel.</p><p>A lot, yes, but there’s more: I compile the best takes of the week on other issues in education policy, these coming from Condoleezza Rice, Eric Hanushek, Jessica Grose, Matt Yglesias, James Traub, Freddie deBoer, Kevin Huffman, Nat Malkus, Karen Vaites, Dan Buck, Mike McShane, Matt Barnum, Robert Pondiscio, and Ron Matus.</p><p>Next week I promise to return to blue-state ed reform and why some insist that it’s just different, not dead. Look forward to contributions from Conor Williams, Heather Peske, Marguerite Roza, and Morgan Polikoff.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox on Tuesday and Friday mornings.

Education reformers have thoughts! Let’s run them down, from most to least opposed.</p><p><strong>Kevin Carey</strong>, <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/press-releases/dismantling-the-department-of-education-wasteful-wrong-and-illegal/">New America</a></p><blockquote><p>This deeply unpopular administration lacks the votes in Congress to shut down ED. That’s why Secretary McMahon is creating a bureaucratic Rube Goldberg machine that will waste millions of taxpayer dollars by outsourcing vital programs to other agencies. It’s like paying a contractor double to mow your lawn and then claiming you’ve cut the home maintenance budget. It makes no sense.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Denise Forte</strong>, <a href="https://edtrust.org/press-room/dismantling-of-the-department-of-education-fails-students/?emci=ccef3fa5-87c1-f011-8196-6045bdfe8e9c&amp;emdi=4ee9dc05-ccc4-f011-8196-6045bdfe8e9c&amp;ceid=272565">Ed Trust</a></p><blockquote><p>Today, the Trump administration began the process of selling off the Department of Education for parts. The administration has let down teachers, families, and students—those currently in classrooms and the generations to come. The Department is further diminishing these offices that protect student rights and stop discrimination and sending them off to be run by agencies that work on public health and short-term training, which lack the skills, expertise, or capacity in education. This isn’t about improving student outcomes; it’s about implementing a business model that transforms students into widgets instead of human beings who need support.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kevin Huffman</strong>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kevin-huffman-793937a_opinion-an-8-percent-lifetime-tax-is-activity-7396922787199889408-5dnj/">LinkedIn</a></p><blockquote><p>Making SEAs call </p></blockquote>...</source>
