        <img src="https://www.austinpolitics.net/content/images/2025/11/IMG_4135.jpeg" alt="What about the firefighter contract?"><p>Sources in several City Council offices say the proposed firefighters union contract is now at risk in the wake of Prop Q's failure. </p><p>The Austin Firefighters Association is voting next week on approving the collective bargaining agreement hammered out between union leaders and the administration of City Manager T.C. Broadnax. Council was expected to ratify the agreement on Thursday. </p><p>Now some Council members are reluctant to approve an expensive contract when the city is scrounging for money. The fact that the firefighters union didn't support Prop Q and got in a <a href="https://www.austinpolitics.net/watson-broadnax-strike-back-at-fire-union-prez/" rel="noreferrer">highly publicized spat with the fire chief, city manager and mayor</a> over the city's response to the Kerr County floods this summer may also hurt their position on the dais. </p><p>Fire union boss Bob Nicks told me he hadn't heard any concerns from Council when I spoke to him this morning, but he didn't sound shocked either. </p>
