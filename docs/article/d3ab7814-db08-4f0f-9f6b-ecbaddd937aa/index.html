For those of you who may have missed previous editions, here’s a bit of context:</p><p><em>In this monthly series, Sam Colt and I will each share our picks for artists and/or titles that haven't received their due. You'll recognize Sam's name from our On Repeat and Friends Best of Series, as well as<strong><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thekevinalexander/p/wax-ecstatic-the-100-greatest-albums-e59?r=3cbf2&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false"> our Top 100 of all-time series</a> </strong>last fall. These posts will adopt the latter's format; I will make my case for my three picks and my reaction to Sam's. Sam's page will do the reverse. </em></p><p><em>In the inaugural post, we noted that successive editions would narrow things down slightly. Maybe a specific genre…maybe a specific era…maybe a specific…well, who knows! </em></p><div><hr></div><p>One of the best lines of advice I ever heard about what makes a good podcast, newsletter, whatever is that it’ll <em>“treat your audience like it’s already almost the end of the first quarter.”</em> This was for an American football podcast, and the idea was to assume your audience is highly knowledgeable but not necessarily subject-matter experts. In other words, it assumes listeners already know that touchdowns are worth six points, what a safety is, etc., so you needn’t take time explaining such things. That’s something I’ve always taken to heart and is why you won’t see something like <em>“Webster’s defines trip hop as…”</em> as an opener. At the same time, they might not know the intricacies of a specific play or why it worked or failed. That middle ground is where you kick off from.</p><p>Trip hop’s a fun one for me for a couple of reasons. First, as many of you know, I’m a fan of just about anything with a big beat. The more my hearing diminishes, the more my need to (literally) feel the beat grows. So there’s that. It’s also a genre I know my way around, but am still finding new corners to explore and alleys to go down. Lastly, this is a genre where artists both obey and overstep the definitions. The guardrails are already broad — there’s a lot of time zones between, say, Portishead and Tricky — but artists pushing the limits make for a fun ride.</p><p>“Dummy” felt like a default option, so it’s </p>...</source>
