Fuentes, the 27-year-old leader of the extremist “groyper” movement, advocates for <a href="https://x.com/TheTNHoller/status/1596207298225262593">racial segregation</a>, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/10/nick-fuentes-texas-meeting/">praises Hitler</a>, and argues that women <a href="https://hillsdalecollegian.com/2019/12/conservatives-reject-nick-fuentes/">should not be allowed to vote</a>.</p><p>“Jews are running society, women need to shut the fuck up, Blacks need to be imprisoned for the most part, and we would live in paradise,” Fuentes said on the <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/diversity-discrimination/nick-fuentes-jews-are-running-society-women-need-shut-fuck-blacks-need-be">March 28</a> edition of his podcast. “White men need to run the household, they need to run the country, they need to run the companies. They just need to run everything.”</p><p>Nevertheless, on October 27, Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efBB0D4tf1Y">interviewed</a> Fuentes for more than two hours on Carlson’s popular podcast. During the interview, where Fuentes criticized the “organized Jewry” for dividing America, called for the creation of a “pro-white” Christian movement, and said he was a “fan” of Joseph Stalin, Carlson did not challenge Fuentes’ bigoted views.</p><p>Instead, Carlson praised Fuentes as “amazing,” “clearly talented,” and “engaged.” He described Fuentes’ ideas as “not crazy.” Carlson criticized those who dismissed Fuentes as “racist” or “an anti-semite” rather than take Fuentes’ political views seriously.</p><p>Carlson’s interview with Fuentes drew widespread condemnation, including from figures on the political right.</p><p>Conservative pundit Ben Shapiro said Carlson’s interview of Fuentes established him as the “<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ae/podcast/ep-2309-tucker-carlson-sabotages-america/id1047335260?i=1000735046902">most virulent super-spreader of vile ideas in America</a>.” Fox News Host Mark Levin called Carlson a “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nazi-promoter-mark-levin-skewers-205601144.html">Nazi promoter</a>“ and “a modern-day David Duke.” A Wall Street Journal op-ed argued Carlson <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/a-german-lesson-for-the-heritage-foundation-8a056801?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqf2YCtgDDSP88IT5W89kC2kcPzlaE5RCRM8fl-2M3cHwj3lnEMxGv6e&amp;gaa_ts=6910bc4c&amp;gaa_sig=BcgHkJZsYgQWLHv-uu3_7qQG_uhkDZ6U0gWwYLXwN_kz03mC8MIDa_rup2Yz_MiCpO_T2Dwk118jXI9PZyROuQ%3D%3D">gave Fuentes</a> “a platform to air a sampling of his antisemitic, racist and misogynistic views uncontested.”</p><p>“If you sit there with someone who says Adolf Hitler was very, very cool and that their mission is to combat and defeat global Jewry, and you say nothing, then you are a coward and you are complicit in that evil,” Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nick-fuentes-tucker-carlson-ted-cruz-podcast-heritage-10969153">said</a>. Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) opined that “<a href="https://x.com/SenMcConnell/status/1984284111482323270">conservatives should feel no obligation to carry water for antisemites</a>.” Congressman Randy Fine (R-FL) said Carlson was functioning as “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/maga-lawmaker-calls-tucker-carlson-213516899.html">a modern-day Hitler youth</a>“ and has “inspired a movement of hate in our midst.”</p><p>Yet, as Carlson’s ideological allies abandon him, three prominent companies are currently sponsoring Carlson’s podcast. Rocket Money, Eight Sleep, and Beam have all sponsored Carlson’s podcast after the Fuentes interview.</p><p>These </p>...</source>
