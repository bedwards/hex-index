At first, this statement may seem a bit grandiose and conjure images of the great scientists to come before our time – Marie Curie comes to mind first for me. Like a statement that should just be an unspoken, but universally accepted truth. However, I believe that “<em>giant</em>” should not be assigned solely to those who are listed in our textbooks or whose names are on the halls of our schools, but also to those who have helped us on the journey to get to where we are now. The professors, the colleagues, the students that surround us and mentor us to be better.</p><p><strong>Mentors make a difference that matters</strong>, and the quality of our mentors can change the trajectory of our work for better or for worse. As such, understanding what makes a good mentor and how to be an effective teacher is key to fostering the next generation of researchers. In the following sections, I have taken some of the words from my mentors as well as my own experience to outline what I believe are the best ways to be an effective mentor regardless of your field of study.</p><div><hr></div><h2>👨‍🏫 <strong>Set Expectations</strong></h2><p>To be an effective mentor, there is a general expectation that you will provide professional guidance while maintaining a friendly and supportive relationship with your mentee. Understanding this simple expectation helps mentors put the goals of the project into perspective. The same is true for the mentee. By setting clear expectations for them early on<sup> </sup>they are more likely to succeed and reach the goals that you both have. The following questions can help you start to set your own expectations for the mentee.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>What are the expected working hours?</p></li><li><p>What is the best method for communication and what is the frequency of progress reporting?</p></li><li><p>What are the learning outcomes and deliverables for this project?</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>However, it is key to realize that mentorship is a two-way street and effective mentors should always have the mentee’s best interests in mind. Ask them what their expectations are of you and adjust accordingly to meet their specific needs.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>What do you want to get out of this experience?</p></li><li><p>How do you want to contribute?</p></li><li><p>How can I best enable your success?</p></li></ul></blockquote><h2>📚 </h2>...</source>
