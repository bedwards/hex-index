        <p>In late November, I <a href="https://x.com/_ericblanc/status/1993761184349126800">argued</a> that “way too much leftist discourse is polarized into denunciations vs. defenses of Zohran. A more useful &amp; important debate is how to organize enough New Yorkers to win Zohran’s agenda — and to counteract the inevitable pressures on him from capital and the political establishment.”</p><p>Others disagreed. A few days later, the pro-Palestine group Within Our Lifetime (WOL) posted a public sign-on statement <a href="https://x.com/WOLPalestine/status/1996008890056532338">announcing</a> that Zohran’s decision to reappoint Jessica Tisch as NYPD Commissioner “betrays his campaign promises and aligns him with the NYPD’s legacy of policing, surveillance, and repression” and “effectively endorses the NYPD’s ongoing collaboration with the Israeli occupation.”</p><p>Tisch deserves our critique. She is a pro-Israel billionaire heiress who, as Ross Barkan <a href="https://rosselliotbarkan.com/p/should-zohran-actually-keep-tisch">notes</a>, “sounds no different than a Long Island Republican when it comes to the topic of criminal justice.” But before digging into the debate over her reappointment, it’s useful to address an underlying strategic question: When and how should the Left criticize elected officials like Zohran?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp" width="550" height="352.4901703800786" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:489,&quot;width&quot;:763,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:550,&quot;bytes&quot;:40396,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.laborpolitics.com/i/181351924?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Q9GC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053df54b-e2a6-4c7a-8979-2bed72f64fb4_763x489.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Jessica Tisch and Zohran Mamdani</figcaption></figure></div><h1><strong>Criticism is Good. But What Kind?</strong></h1><p>On the general question of whether it’s necessary for socialists to criticize Left elected officials, history is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27098980?seq=1https://www.jstor.org/stable/27098980?seq=1">full</a> of examples of movements demobilizing and subordinating themselves to their friends in power. It would be a tragedy if that happened in New York City. Given the constraints and pressure he is under, and the overall weakness of working-class organization after fifty years of neoliberalism, Mayor Mamdani is bound to make many decisions the Left will disagree with; refusing on principle to ever voice criticisms or to take an independent stand would be a road to ruin for organizations like New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the Left as a whole, demoralizing activists and undermining credibility with supporters.</p><p>But there’s no shortage of leftists who are generally willing to disagree with or diverge from our new mayor and other Left politicians. Many NYC-DSA leaders argued <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/mamdani-pleads-directly-nyc-dsa-032300297.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALGv9sGnKnZ0xnK2Ks8yJa-WYYHcoOUqg-W3SLTQrh_60YyfCq5QMol8kSW1BU5yKzT8NSGeAZmYMqHklBgB5y-HykdnRpCQq99pLDngh15slqvAs_PdWuZTr0_MxY8wGgHCtI17R9JX6YOj0-X5oIwMvdX6TKHles5FmOaUpvPI">in favor</a> of the chapter endorsing New York city council member <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/11/chi-osse-dsa-mamdani-socialism">Chi Osse</a>’s bid to primary Hakeem Jeffries despite Mamdani’s vocal opposition. Most currents of DSA supported a <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/statements/on-the-iron-dome-vote/">public statement</a> criticizing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s vote against an amendment blocking funding for Israel’s Iron Dome. For my part, this week I <a href="https://x.com/_ericblanc/status/1998417791318466677">wrote</a> on Twitter: “Instead of asking for more donations, would love to see Zohran start asking supporters to join mass organizing fightbacks.
