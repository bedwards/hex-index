In the lead-up to his eventual presidential win, then presidential nominee Joe Biden signaled his opposition to fossil fuels by proclaiming at a town hall event in New York City, “I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil fuel, and I am not going to cooperate with them.” He clarified that this meant no more subsidies, no more drilling on federal lands, and “no ability for the oil industry to drill, period.
