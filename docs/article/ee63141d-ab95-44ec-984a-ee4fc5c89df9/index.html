        <h2></h2><h2>What City Observatory Did This Week</h2><p><a href="https://cityobservatory.org/ten-things-to-know-about-the-transportation-package/">Ten things to know about the transportation package</a>. Oregon's Legislature met in special session over the Labor Day weekend to develop a new transportation package, now known as HB 3991. The $4.3 billion bill is in limbo as the Senate struggles to assemble the votes needed to pass it. While everyone is waiting, we have a summary of the issues that this package raises.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cost Overruns</strong> - ODOT's financial problems stem from mega-project cost explosions, like the Abernethy Bridge tripling to $815 million and Rose Quarter quadrupling to $2.1 billion.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Maintenance Requirements</strong> - HB 3991 contains no language requiring new revenue go to actual maintenance and operations rather than mega-projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Borrowing Against Future Revenue</strong> - ODOT can use debt to divert new tax revenue to fund mega-project overruns, having already borrowed $271 million this way.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Real Accountability</strong> - Proposed oversight measures mirror previous failed attempts like task forces and dashboards that didn't prevent cost overruns.</p></li><li><p><strong>False Maintenance Priorities</strong> - ODOT claims to prioritize maintenance over expansion but historically does the opposite after securing funding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Misleading Spending Comparisons</strong> - ODOT's claims that Oregon spends less on transportation than other states are fabricated and inaccurate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diverting Existing Funds</strong> - ODOT has repeatedly moved operations and preservation money to cover mega-project costs like the Abernethy Bridge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Revenue Hasn't Declined</strong> - Motor fuel tax revenue actually increased $97 million over five years, contradicting ODOT's revenue decline claims.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hidden IBR Cost Estimates</strong> - ODOT is concealing new Interstate Bridge Replacement costs likely reaching $9-10 billion, with Oregon owing $1-2 billion more (see next commentary).</p></li><li><p><strong>Rose Quarter Deficit</strong> - The Rose Quarter project faces a $1.5 billion shortfall but ODOT continues construction despite state analysis showing completion may be impossible.</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://cityobservatory.org/ibr_dont_tell_anyone/">Watch out for a $10 billion price-tag for the. Interstate Bridge</a>. Even as it moves forward with this $4.3 billion "band-aid"--legislators are due for yet another multi-billion dollar surprise, as IBR is once again delaying releasing a new cost estimate for the Interstate Bridge Project. It's an ominous sign that the cost is going to be much, much higher.</p><p>IBR leaders have known since January of 2024 that costs were going to be even higher--but repeatedly they've delayed releasing a new estimate.</p><p>In testimony to the Portland City Council project director Greg Johnson announced that there would be yet another delay, until late 2025 or early ...</p>
