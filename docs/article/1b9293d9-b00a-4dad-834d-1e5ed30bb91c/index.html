        <p>The United States and Europe have long used unilateral sanctions as a tool of imperial power, to discipline and even destroy Global South governments that seek to shake off Western domination, chart an independent path, and establish any kind of meaningful sovereignty.</p><p>During the 1970s, there were, on average, about 15 countries under Western unilateral sanctions in any given year. In many cases, these sanctions sought to strangle access to finance and international trade, destabilise industries, and inflame crises to provoke state collapse.</p><p>For instance, when the popular socialist Salvador Allende was elected to power in Chile in 1970, the US government imposed brutal sanctions on the country. At a September 1970 meeting at the White House, US President Richard Nixon explained the objective was to “make [Chile’s] economy scream”. The historian Peter Kornbluh describes the sanctions as an “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pinochet-File-Declassified-Atrocity-Accountability/dp/1595589120">invisible blockade</a>” that cut Chile off from international finance, created social unrest, and paved the way for the US-backed coup that installed the brutal right-wing dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p><p>Since then, the US and Europe have dramatically increased their use of sanctions. During the 1990s and 2000s, an average of 30 countries were under Western unilateral sanctions in any given year. And now, as of the 2020s, it is more than 60 – a strikingly high proportion of the countries of the Global South.</p><p>Sanctions often have a huge human toll. Scholars have demonstrated this in several well-known cases, such as the <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674064089">US sanctions against Iraq</a> in the 1990s that led to widespread malnutrition, lack of clean water, and shortages of medicine and electricity. More recently, US economic warfare <a href="https://cepr.net/images/stories/reports/venezuela-sanctions-2019-04.pdf">against Venezuela</a> has resulted in a severe economic crisis, with one study estimating that sanctions caused 40,000 excess deaths in just one year, from 2017 to 2018.</p><p>Until now, researchers have sought to understand the human toll of sanctions on a case-by-case basis. This is difficult work and can only ever give us a partial picture. But that has changed with <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00189-5/fulltext">new research</a> published this year in The Lancet Global Health, which gives us a global view for the first time. Led by the economist Francisco Rodriguez at the University of Denver, the study calculates the total number of excess deaths associated with international sanctions from 1970 to 2021.</p><p>The results are staggering. In their central estimate, the authors find that unilateral sanctions imposed by the US and EU since ...</p>
