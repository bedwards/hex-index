        <h3>Welcome to Peter Mungiguerra’s Newsletter: Waco Can’t Wait</h3><p>Hello, and welcome to my newsletter, Waco Can’t Wait. I am inviting you to be one of my first subscribers because I believe you share my vision of a bluer Waco, McLennan County, and Texas. You have taken action by making a campaign contribution, volunteering, protesting, or by taking an active interest in what is going on in our community, state, and country. I thank you for the work you’ve done, and I hope you will take this journey with me. </p><h3>My Bio</h3><p>If we haven’t met before, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and what gives me any kind of authority to speak on these matters. If you already know me, feel free to scroll on to the next section!</p><p>I graduated from Baylor University as a University Scholar, concentrating in Political Science, Economics, and Philosophy. While at Baylor University, I worked as a paid campus organizer for Beto’s 2018 Senate campaign.

During that session, we were able to pass transformative legislation funding public education, while also stopping scores of harmful bills filed by Republicans.</p><p>In the Summer of 2019, I married my beautiful wife Bailey. We met when we were in 8th grade back in our hometown of Flower Mound, Texas, and we had been dating since October 13, 2014. She is my best friend, my partner, and (more recently) the Senior Executive Editor for this newsletter! We also have our tabby cat Cissy and our miniature schnauzer Hank. </p><p>Once the session was complete, I moved back to Waco to work for the McLennan County Democratic Party as its Executive Director. I had the opportunity to work closely with our fantastic MCDP Chairwoman Mary Duty, our precinct chairs, and the rest of the amazing volunteer team that keeps the county party running.
