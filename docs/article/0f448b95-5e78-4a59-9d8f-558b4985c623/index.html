Ten days later, Altman is back, along with company president Greg Brockman and the hundreds of employees who threatened to resign if OpenAI’s board would not reverse its decision. Viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears odd that the net result of Silicon Valley’s most engrossing drama in recent memory was a barely modified status quo.</p><p>The conventional wisdom now holds that OpenAI’s nonprofit board overplayed its hand, communicated its decision and motives terribly, and disqualified itself from governing the most important company of its generation. And I basically agree with all that, <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/openais-alignment-problem">as I wrote here last week</a>. Whatever reasons the board may have had for declining to outline with any specificity why they fired the CEO who had led their organization to great success, in the end their silence doomed them.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet: for everything they failed at, the board does appear to have succeeded in putting a new governance structure into place. Altman and Brockman are no longer on the board; Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, who voted to fire Altman, remains as well, and will help to fill out the rest of its membership. Bret Taylor, the former Twitter board chair, and Larry Summers, the former US Treasury secretary, will join D’Angelo on the board; together, they will appoint up to six new members. In addition, the new board will commission an independent investigation into the events surrounding Altman’s firing.</p><p>Corporate investigations vary widely in quality and rigor, and it remains to be seen whom the board will ask to conduct this one. There’s no guarantee that the results of the investigation will be made public, though there’s a case to be made that they should be, at least in part. And whatever the investigation finds, it’s not clear at this point what it would have to find to justify Altman’s removal —&nbsp;especially to the company’s employees, whose <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/11/20/technology/letter-to-the-open-ai-board.html">near-unanimous support for their CEO</a> is all but unheard of in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Still: it feels too early to declare the story over. The soon-to-be-former members of OpenAI’s board will speak eventually: to investigators, the public, or </p>...</source>
