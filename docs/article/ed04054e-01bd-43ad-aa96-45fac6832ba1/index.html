I go out of my way to make sarcastic, biting jokes about America’s hypocrisy on national holidays, and scoff at my parents — loyalists to the Democratic Party — when they repeat the well-known bit about how “despite its many flaws, this is still a great nation.”</p><p>Yes, I’m a millennial. How could you tell? Like many of my peers, I’m prone to a deadly combination of pessimistic cynicism and utopian idealism. To most of us, the claim that corruption and injustice are bugs and not features of the American Project is a mark of being <em>démodé</em>, in denial of the truth, and insufferably cringe.</p><p>Mind you, my brand of millennial idealism is a special one. Just like a snowflake, I am unlike all the others. Being a moderate liberal or conservative was cringe, but so was being a woke SJW (or a far-right anti-woke reactionary).

It claims to respect freedom of religion, speech, and local institutions, while in reality it cuts us off from that which is most essential: God, family, and local community.</p><p>Of course, it’s very easy to play this game while living in the comfort of a liberal democratic country. “Among the many freedoms enjoyed by citizens in a democracy” writes the journalist Shadi Hamid in his latest book <em>The Case for American Power, </em>“one of the least appreciated is the freedom to panic and assume that the worst is yet to come. This is a right (and luxury) that is generally lacking under dictatorship.”</p><p>Hamid highlights that those of us living in liberal democracies have grown “accustomed to expressing either doubt or a kind of ironic detachment about our own success. To say that you love democracy or that you love America,” he concedes, “is to be decidedly uncool . . . I feel uncool just writing this.” Yet he affirms that his </p>...</source>
