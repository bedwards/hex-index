        <p>This is a guest post from a friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eyalworth/">Eyal Worthalter</a>, who leads security sales at Marvell. Eyal calls himself a “recovering VP of Sales” who’s spent 15+ years scaling cybersecurity teams. As an engineer-turned-sales-exec, he’s seen enough challenges hiring sales leaders to fuel a lifetime of LinkedIn rants about what doesn’t work in cyber sales. In this guest post, Eyal shares the hard-earned lessons from the trenches to help founders avoid some painful mistakes.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><h1>Introduction and the ‘why’ of this blog post</h1><p>I’m an electronics engineer turned into a tech salesperson.

The one thing I absolutely love about sales, is that you have to keep learning about your customers, and being in front of customers is my absolutely favorite part about the job. But, there are days when the job is brutal. I’ve come to accept it as part of the ride, but I’ve also felt that there are things under my control that can help improve how I go about crushing or failing at my job. I tend to share these things with others in order to help cyber sales and sales leaders improve their game and hopefully thrive, rather than languish.</p><p>If you are reading this and you are building out your company or you are a VC that invests in cyber, please read ahead. Look, I won’t sugarcoat it. Following this advice means saying no to quick fixes and yes to ...</p>
