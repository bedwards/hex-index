Professors, for instance, are overwhelmingly <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/being-a-professor-is-a-product-and">relatively affluent</a>, <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/professors-are-highly-unrepresentative">urban and suburban whites</a> who graduated with terminal degrees from the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05222-x">top programs</a> in their fields. </p><p>These kinds of folks don’t just dominate academia. They are the <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/we-have-never-been-woke-is-now-officially">primary producers and consumers</a> of most content produced in the “<a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/meet-the-symbolic-capitalists">symbolic professions</a>.”</p><p>People who share this background tend to vary in dramatic and systematic ways from most other Americans. They <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/weird-symbolic-professions">perceive and think about</a> the world differently. They have different <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2023/03/21/ideological-gaps-mental-illness-well-being/">emotional</a> tendencies than most people. They have highly idiosyncratic <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/its-the-knowledge-economy-stupid">political preferences and modes of engagement</a>. And then tend to be <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/smugness-partisan-diploma-divide">disdainful and intolerant</a> towards those whose perspectives diverge from their own.</p><p>These differences, which are large under ordinary circumstances, grew much larger and more salient after 2011 -- <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2023/02/08/great-awokening-ending/3/">including and especially</a> in higher ed – fueling mistrust and polarization around academic institutions, professors, and their teaching and research.</p><p>When people talk about these differences, they often focus narrowly on political affiliation or political ideologies: professors are overwhelmingly Democrats and tend to identify with the “left.” However, in many respects, this misses the forest for the trees.</p><p>For instance, understanding these institutions as “left” can’t easily account for the <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2024/05/09/columbia-ivy-intifada-class/">militant response</a> schools mounted against students protesting the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza. Nor can it explain why higher ed institutions are some of the most <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/social-justice-discourse-notwithstanding">hierarchical and parochial</a> institutions in America. Nor can it be easily reconciled with the central and growing role these institutions play in the <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/education-and-privilege-laundering">production and legitimation</a> of inequality.</p><p>In reality, colleges and universities <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/we-have-never-been-woke-is-now-officially">have never been woke</a>. Instead, it’s more apt to understand these institutions as oriented around the interests and worldviews of highly-educated and relatively well-off urban and suburban whites – often <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/davarian-l-baldwin/in-the-shadow-of-the-ivory-tower/9781568588919/?lens=bold-type-books">at the expense</a> of the marginalized and disadvantaged in society – “social justice” discourse notwithstanding.&nbsp;</p><p>We can see this reality at work, for instance, in how efforts to make it easier to purge or censor scholars for coloring outside the “correct” ideological lines <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2023/11/20/censorship-self-science-paper/4/">tend to undermine</a> conservatives, yes, but also racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants, faculty from nontraditional backgrounds, contingent faculty, and faculty at land-grant public universities.</p><p>These trends are actually <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/2020/01/14/positionality-homogeneity-social-research-holism/">interrelated</a>. Ethnic and religious minorities, immigrants, Americans from small towns and rural areas, etc. are significantly <a href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/blog/viewpoint-diversity-transcends-politics/">more likely</a> to be socially conservative than urban and suburban </p>...</source>
