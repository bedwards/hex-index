        <p>Here’s my understanding of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrq1vwe73po">the situation</a>:</p><p>Anthropic signed a contract with the Pentagon last summer. It originally said the Pentagon had to follow Anthropic’s Usage Policy like everyone else. In January, the Pentagon attempted to renegotiate, asking to ditch the Usage Policy and instead have Anthropic’s AIs available for “all lawful purposes”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. Anthropic demurred, asking for a guarantee that their AIs would not be used for mass surveillance of American citizens or no-human-in-the-loop killbots. The Pentagon refused the guarantees, demanding that Anthropic accept the renegotiation unconditionally and threatening “consequences” if they refused. These consequences are generally understood to be some mix of :</p><ul><li><p>canceling the contract</p></li><li><p>using the Defense Production Act, a law which lets the Pentagon force companies to do things, to force Anthropic to agree.</p></li><li><p>the nuclear option, designating Anthropic a “supply chain risk”. This would ban US companies that use Anthropic products from doing business with the military<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>. Since many companies do some business with the government, this would lock them out of large parts of the corporate world and be potentially fatal to their business<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a>. The “supply chain risk” designation has previously only been used for foreign companies like Huawei that we think are using their connections to spy on or implant malware in American infrastructure. Using it as a bargaining chip to threaten a domestic company in contract negotiations is unprecedented.</p></li></ul><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxanthropicrisk/will-the-pentagon-designate-anthropic-a-supply-chain-risk/kxanthropicrisk" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png" width="542" height="287.98649951783995" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:551,&quot;width&quot;:1037,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:542,&quot;bytes&quot;:120913,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://kalshi.com/markets/kxanthropicrisk/will-the-pentagon-designate-anthropic-a-supply-chain-risk/kxanthropicrisk&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/189131485?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OfzI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8002f6ce-f1c6-43a3-9786-860639a92cd9_1037x551.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">I don’t know why this dropped so much last night (at the very end of the graph) - anyone know what news it was reacting to?</figcaption></figure></div><div id="prediction-market-iframe" class="prediction-market-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://manifold.markets/embed/Bayesian/outcomes-of-the-anthropic-vs-us-gov&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83a524fd-a605-4607-a7af-96410ac3f4ab_600x315.png&quot;}" data-component-name="PredictionMarketToDOM"><iframe id="iframe-prediction-market" class="prediction-market-iframe" src="https://manifold.markets/embed/Bayesian/outcomes-of-the-anthropic-vs-us-gov" width="560px" height="405px" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>Needless to say, I support Anthropic here. I’m a sensible moderate on the killbot issue (we’ll probably get them eventually, and I doubt they’ll make things much worse compared to AI “only” having unfettered access to every Internet-enabled computer in the world). But AI-enabled mass surveillance of US citizens seems like the sort of thing we should at least have a chance to think over, rather than demanding it from the get-go. </p><p>More important, I don’t want the Pentagon to destroy Anthropic. Partly this is a generic belief: the “supply chain risk” designation was intended as a defense against foreign spies, and it’s pathetic Third World bullshit to reconceive it as an instrument that lets the US government destroy any domestic company it wants, with no legal review, because they don’t like how contract negotiations are going. But partly it’s because </p>...</source>
