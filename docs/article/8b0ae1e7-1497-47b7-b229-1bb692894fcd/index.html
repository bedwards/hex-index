It is called Beehiiv (yes, it is spelled that way), and like Substack it has grown rapidly to become one of the leaders for content creators who author email newsletters. Both platforms have their strengths, but after learning more about the feature differences I am making the switch!</p><p><strong>What does this mean for you as a reader? For now, very little. </strong>I’ve copied over my archive of previous posts to Beehiiv <a href="https://nowtakingthefield.beehiiv.com/">here</a>. That is the new home base (home plate?) for <em>Now Taking the Field</em> going forward.</p><p>I’ve also copied over the list of subscribers, so if you are reading this as an email, that includes you! I want to take this opportunity to <strong>thank you</strong> for subscribing and reading my baseball newsletters—whether you have just recently subscribed or have been with me since the start back in the summer of 2022… thank you!</p><p><strong>I do have one favor to ask of you</strong>—in the coming days you should receive my first couple of newsletters authored on Beehiiv instead of on Substack. Be on the look out for them, and if they don’t arrive in your email inbox, then please check your junk, spam, promotions, social, or other such email folders or tabs (these vary depending on whether you use gmail, yahoo!, hotmail, etc.) Please move my newsletter emails into your direct inbox, as that way future newsletters will arrive there and not get lost elsewhere. Doing so also helps the deliverability of my newsletter overall, which I’ll very much appreciate as I make this changeover.</p><h4>What’s next?</h4><p>In addition to the above logistical update, I’d like to tease up a bit of what I’ve got planned next for <em>Now Taking the Field</em>. Long term I have a <em>lot</em> of plans, but most of it will take time to develop. What I can share for now is that 2025 will be a <em>big</em> year for me and my baseball writing, and the newsletter will be at the center of it. Most notably, some of you might have read this posting I did back in September of last year:</p><p><a href="https://nowtakingthefield.beehiiv.com/p/the-baseball-buffet-for-9222024">The Baseball Buffet for 9/22/2024</a></p><p>As I noted at the top of that issue, this was a prototype for </p>...</source>
