Delve into the Nrf2 pathway, a critical mechanism for cellular defense, and discover the benefits of sulforaphane from broccoli as a potent Nrf2 activator. Dr. Palliyaguru, a renowned expert in aging and disease prevention, shares her extensive research on how environmental toxins affect health and longevity. Learn about innovative strategies to combat pollution-related health risks and enhance lifespan through nutritional interventions and scientific advancements. Join us for an insightful conversation on promoting longevity in a polluted world.</p><p><strong>Dushani Palliyaguru – brief CV</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Dushani is an expert in aging and longevity, disease prevention and environmental health. She has over a decade of experience in scientific research and leadership at top-tier institutions in the US. Dushani completed her Ph.D. in Environmental and Occupational Health at University of Pittsburgh focusing on liver disease and cancer prevention using nutritional and natural compounds (with Dr. Thomas W. Kensler). Nrf2-mediated environmental stress response pathways was a major focus of this work. Subsequently, she completed a Postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute on Aging focusing on metabolic and molecular biomarkers of aging and Alzheimer’s disease, and pharmacological/nutritional interventions to target these.&nbsp;<br>Her current project: </p><p>https://www.healthsurveil.us/</p><p><strong>Pollution, environmental exposure, health and what we can do about it</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Concerns include heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, endocrine disruptors like bisphenol a (BPA), phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). While the evidence is often weak for the harms of specific substances, the precautionary principle should be applied to these chemicals, commonly termed persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Because these are so persistent they might have unanticipated health effects and it might be too late when we first see warning signs of those health effects, because by then the POPs would have accumulated to very high levels in the environment and the human body.&nbsp;</p><p>Dushani started her company HealthSurveil, in part, because she was fed up with the slow translation of research findings. She thinks that we have the tools available now to improve the lives of people. One of the themes of her company includes monitoring environmental exposures, e.g. to airborne pollutants. Air pollution is responsible for many premature deaths and certain aspects of lung aging, especially in Asia and in large cities across the globe.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nrf2 signaling, sulforaphane and other </strong></p>...</source>
