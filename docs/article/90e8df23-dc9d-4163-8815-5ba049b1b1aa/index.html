        <p>Across tech, the average tenure of software engineers seems to be rising, not least <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/172584839/tenure-rising-fast-at-big-tech">in Big Tech</a> where it has increased rapidly. With today’s chilly job market having a dampening effect on the number of engineers switching jobs, it’s possible that staying in a role for years will become pretty normal for many in our industry.</p><p>So, if you can see yourself at your current workplace for the longer term, it’s sensible to consider the career path options available, and how to get promoted to the next level.</p><p>To shed light on these topics and others, I sought out someone who has managed large engineering orgs at a massive company. <strong><a href="https://www.ethanevans.com/">Ethan Evans</a></strong> is precisely such a person; he was a Vice President of Engineering at Amazon, and has overseen the growth and promotions of more than 1,000 engineers(!) over the course of his career.</p><p>Now recently retired from the online retail giant, Ethan can candidly discuss how large companies operate, and which tactics and strategies <em>really </em>work and help colleagues to enjoy thriving careers in big workplaces.</p><p>These days, Ethan <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans/early-career-promotion-fast-track">teaches</a> engineers and engineering managers how to get promoted faster, and runs <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans">live courses</a>. He’s also built a 24/7 personalized <a href="https://levelupwithethanevans.substack.com/p/announcing-ethan-evans-ai">“AI career coach”</a>, and shares career growth advice in his weekly newsletter, <a href="https://levelupwithethanevans.substack.com/">Level Up.</a> His <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans/early-career-promotion-fast-track">class on fast career growth</a> currently has a 25% discount for the US Thanksgiving holiday, from today through 2 Dec — <em>you can <a href="https://maven.com/ethan-evans/early-career-promotion-fast-track">check it out here</a>.</em></p><p>In this issue, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Good performance as a mid-level engineer.</strong> Execute independently and try not to complain too much.</p></li><li><p><strong>How to get a slam-dunk promotion to Senior. </strong>Have big ideas that are also correct, solve problems leadership didn’t know existed, see around corners, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tactics to get promoted to Senior. </strong>Agree a plan with your manager and be realistic about how long it takes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Getting promoted to Principal Engineer. </strong>Standout technical expertise, tackling ambiguous &amp; large-scale problems, and paying attention to the business, are all key.</p></li><li><p><strong>Should you be a manager? </strong>As you grow more senior, there may be opportunities to become a manager. But is it the best path for you?</p></li><li><p><strong>When to switch to management. </strong>Switching early (at L5) or later (L7+) is rare, and is most common at senior level (L6).</p></li><li><p><strong>Different management levels. </strong>How being a manager at L5, L6, and L7 levels differ.</p></li></ol><p>Throughout this article, we use ...</p>
