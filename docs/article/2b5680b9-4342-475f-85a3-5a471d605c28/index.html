        <p class="topic-summary">The novel&#039;s title &#039;Seasons Clear, and Awe&#039; is taken directly from Hart Crane&#039;s poem &#039;Voyages,&#039; which is quoted as an epigraph. Understanding Crane&#039;s tragic life, his modernist poetry, and his themes of transcendence and longing provides essential context for the novel&#039;s exploration of artistic aspiration and unfulfilled potential.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The novel is set specifically in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and its townships. Understanding the post-industrial history of the Lehigh Valley—its steel industry decline and transformation into suburban America—provides crucial context for the class dynamics and &#039;post-industrial, late 20th century America&#039; that the novel explicitly addresses.</p>

As Stephen and Elizabeth grow from precocious children into neurotic artists in their thirties, Matthew Gasda reveals how post-industrial, late 20th century America created a generation too intelligent for ordinary happiness, too self-aware for decisive action: suspended between the working-class pragmatism of their fathers and the creative and spiritual aspirations of their mothers, capable of everything except building lives.</em></p><p><em>Matthew Gasda is the founder of the <a href="https://brooklyncenterfortheatreresearch.com/">Brooklyn Center for Theater Research</a> and the author of many books, including the recent novel <a href="https://www.skyhorsepublishing.com/9781648211263/the-sleepers/">The Sleepers</a> and <a href="https://asterismbooks.com/product/writers-diary-matthew-gasda">Writer’s Diary</a>.</em></p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p><em>Bind us in time, O Seasons clear, and awe.</em></p><p><em>O minstrel galleons of Carib fire,</em></p><p><em>Bequeath us to no earthly shore until</em></p><p><em>Is answered in the vortex of our grave</em></p><p><em>The seal’s wide spindrift gaze toward paradise.</em></p><p>— Hart Crane</p><p><em>These beauteous forms,</em></p><p><em>Through a long absence, have not been to me</em></p><p><em>As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye</em></p><p>— Wordsworth</p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p>The next day, Stephen went to the Northwest Swim Club with his friends Ryan and Adam, driven by Ryan’s mother, Mrs. Connell, who tirelessly hosted their sons’ friends and took them to the pool or whatever else, occasional paintball games or trips to the mall. Really, whatever Ryan wanted. The Connells had a little more money than the Gazdas. So did the Vorns.</p><p>Adam’s family was from Holland. The name Vorn was Dutch. Adam’s dad was born in Holland, and people in Holland were very pale. Both Adam and Ryan were bigger than Stephen. Ryan was skinny but taller.
