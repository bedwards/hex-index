        <p>👹 <em><strong>First</strong>: <strong><a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/whats-hitting-you-where-it-hurts">I got phished!</a></strong> Or rather, the newsletter did. Don’t worry you’re fine, I’m just trying to be public about it — especially because the phishing meant many of you did not receive Wednesday’s <strong><a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/how-a-hospital-librarian-spends-their">fascinating interview with a hospital librarian</a></strong>. Go check it out and blame the bots (and me). </em></p><p><strong>🤢</strong><em><strong> Second</strong>: This week’s episode of the Culture Study Pod is <strong><a href="https://culturestudypod.substack.com/p/how-the-manosphere-fuels-climate">about how male grievance culture breeds climate change denial</a></strong> — it’ll piss you off and stick with you. Also check out Friday’s thread re: <strong><a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/whats-hitting-you-where-it-hurts">What’s Hitting You Where It Hurts</a></strong></em> —&nbsp;<em>I found a lot of solace there. </em></p><p><strong>👁 </strong><em><strong>Third: By popular demand, we’re gonna do a series of service-y posts about Big Life Stuff —</strong> think my <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/welcome-to-your-colonoscopyagain">colonoscopy post</a> + <a href="https://annehelen.substack.com/p/get-ready-for-some-real-fibroid-talk">this fibroids post</a>. The topics: Breast Reduction/Mastectomy (For Any Reason); All Things C-Pap Machine; Pelvic Floor Therapy; Financial Planning For People Without Dependents; Managing the In-Between with Aging Parents (before full-time care but need *some* care). </em></p><p><em><strong>If you have experience you’d like to share —&nbsp;or questions you’d like answered — <a href="https://forms.gle/wtN6gzZkHrt2TnHp8">click this link to sign up</a>…..and stay tuned for these posts in months to come!</strong> And if you want to make sure you’re on the list when those pieces come around….</em></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Now let’s talk about Ballerina Farm’s new wellness brand.</strong> Many of you are familiar with the Ballerina Farm brand from my previous conversation with Meg Conley about its “edentic allure,” which has become one of the most popular posts ever published on Culture Study. But for the uninitiated: Ballerina Farm is a tremendously popular Instagram/social media account documenting the life of Hannah Neeleman, a former ballerina-turned-farm-resident and mother of eight children outside of Park City, Utah. </p><div class="instagram" data-attrs="{&quot;instagram_id&quot;:&quot;DL9JmgwsEe4&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A post shared by @ballerinafarm&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;ballerinafarm&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/__ss-rehost__IG-meta-DL9JmgwsEe4.jpg&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}" data-component-name="InstagramToDOM"><div class="instagram-top-bar"><a class="instagram-author-name" href="https://instagram.com/ballerinafarm" target="_blank">ballerinafarm</a></div><a class="instagram-image" href="https://instagram.com/p/DL9JmgwsEe4" target="_blank"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mOsY!,w_640,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F__ss-rehost__IG-meta-DL9JmgwsEe4.jpg"></a><div class="instagram-bottom-bar"><div class="instagram-title">A post shared by <a href="https://instagram.com/ballerinafarm" target="_blank">@ballerinafarm</a></div></div></div><p>I started following Neeleman alongside a dozen or so other influencers who fit into the “tradwife-ish” bucket back in 2021 or so, and have been fascinated by the skill with which she pairs the homesteading aesthetic with, well, <em>a lot of money</em>, and beauty, and children. A lot of influencers are doing something like this on Instagram, but no one does it quite as well as Ballerina Farm — as of this writing, the account has 10.4 million Instagram followers. </p><p><strong>Other points of note:</strong> </p><ul><li><p>Hannah is married to Daniel Neeleman, one of the heirs to the JetBlue fortune </p></li><li><p>She and her family are members of the Church of </p></li>...</ul>
