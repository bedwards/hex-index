Greg Abbott may possibly be the most corrupt Texan who has ever existed, and this is one more outrageous act of political theater he’s launching on a marginalized community, because it’s election time. </p><p>This week, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/11/18/greg-abbott-muslim-land-ownership-ban/">Abbott declared the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)</a>, a mainstream civil rights organization that helps Muslims fight discrimination, a “foreign terrorist organization.” He slapped the same label on the Muslim Brotherhood and then banned both groups and anyone associated with them from owning land in Texas. He ordered the Department of Public Safety to work with FBI task forces to “investigate” them for vague, made-up crimes, as if praying in a mosque or filing a civil rights complaint suddenly makes you a threat to the state.</p><p>Abbott isn’t even pretending this is based on facts. He’s leaning fully into a Fox News fever dream. In his official directive, he claims CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood want to “forcibly impose Sharia law” and seize “mastership of the world.” <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/CAIR_Letter_Freeman_Martin_FINAL_2.pdf">He even cited a report  from the New York Post</a> 🙄 as evidence that CAIR is somehow funding terrorism by giving $1,000 grants to college kids who got in trouble for protesting.</p><p>It should also be noted that the New York Post cites “Network Contagion Institute,” which produces right-wing panic narratives, and does not have either academic legitimacy or terrorism research authority. Basically, it’s bullshit.  </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.cair.com/dispelling-rumors-about-cair/">CAIR: Dispelling Rumors About CAIR</a></p></li></ul><h4>None of this is grounded in law or reality.</h4><p>Greg Abbott’s stunt is anchored entirely in Islamophobic conspiracy theories that have been debunked for decades.</p><p>CAIR literally works with law enforcement. ISIS has targeted its national director because he condemned extremism. But Abbott needs a villain, and he’s decided the villain is… Muslim Texans.</p><p>He is manufacturing “radical Islamic ideology” out of thin air so he can justify state surveillance of mosques, Muslim nonprofits, and Muslim students. And he’s doing it to score political points with people whose worldview begins and ends with,<br>“If you aren’t a white Christian Republican, you aren’t a real Texan.”</p><p>Obey Greg Abbott’s worldview, or you’ll be rebranded an enemy. </p><h4>Where did this come from? Why now?</h4><p>Some very far-right extremists </p>...</source>
