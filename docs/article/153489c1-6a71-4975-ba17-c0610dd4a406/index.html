        <blockquote><p>"That fellow West is a good man in a storm." … "He didn't sleep for four nights! Four whole nights." And if that trip had been his idea of a vacation, where, the psychologist wanted to know, did he work?</p></blockquote><p>The most famous book written about designing computers features a company - Data General - and a computer - the Eclipse MV/8000 - that both disappeared a long time ago. It’s a testament to that book’s quality that it’s just as fascinating as it was when it was published four decades ago.</p><p>What makes Tracy Kidder’s ‘The Soul of a New Machine’ so good?</p><div><hr></div><h4>1. “There’s so goddamn much money to be made.”</h4><blockquote><p>“I’m Ed de Castro, president of Data General Corporation. Seven months ago we started the richest small computer company in history. This month we’re announcing our first product: the best small computer in the world … Because if you’re going to make a small inexpensive computer you have to sell a lot of them to make a lot of money. And we intend to make a lot of money.”</p><p><em>Data General Corporation’s first advertisement.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For many years sociologists and others have written of a computer revolution, impending or in progress. Some enthusiasts have declared that the small inexpensive computer inaugurated a new phase of this upheaval, which would make computers instruments of egalitarianism.</p></blockquote><p>Money and upheaval. Tracy Kidder’s Soul of a New Machine locates computers firmly where we would place them today. But the geography of Kidder’s 1979 book is not Silicon Valley but thousands of miles away in Massachusetts.</p><p>Digital Equipment Corporation had started the ‘minicomputer’ revolution there in 1965. Three years later Ed de Castro, the architect of DEC’s breakout machine, the PDP-8, helped to found Data General (DG).</p><p>DG was ambitious and scrappy. One - unpublished - advertisement was an uncouth pre-echo of Apple’s later defiance at IBM’s intrusion into its territory.</p><blockquote><p>They Say IBM’s Entry Into Minicomputers Will Legitimize The Market. The B*****ds Say, Welcome.</p></blockquote><p>DG were the ‘bad guys’ of the minicomputer world, the ‘Darth Vader of the industry’. There were even rumours that they had burned down the factory of a smaller rival.</p><p>But there was more to DG than its attitude: there was technical excellence. DG’s first machine, the Nova, was genuinely innovative and soon established itself as a effective competition for DEC’s PDP minicomputer series.</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e577a7e5-fe23-4ec0-9621-51d2d898b148_1447x2083.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/57cfdd5a-ec80-4786-ad7f-6e3a8498b795_1487x2099.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;DG's first advertisement for the Nova Minicomputer&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e9bcc8d3-dc30-45ca-8eb4-29f9cbb09d03_1456x720.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p>DG took thriftiness to ...</p>
