        <p>Hi All,</p><p>Writing this end of year piece has been daunting. There have been so many developments during this past year which changed so much about the Russo-Ukraine War and the world in general that focussing on one seemed impossible. For the war, there was the growth of UAV technology over the battlefield, the broadening ranged-weapon war into Ukraine and Russia, the disjointed European decision making process on aiding Ukraine, the growth of Chinese support for Russia, etc. Internationally there was massive developments from the Trump tariff-war, the weakening of US alliances in Europe and Asia, the improvement of China’s position, the war(s) in the Middle East, etc etc.</p><p>However when you step back and look at things from a broad perspective, one thing towers over the others. </p><p>2025 was the year that the USA changed sides. </p><p>In 2024 the US was a strong (and growing) supporter of Ukraine and an opponent of Russian aggression. In 2024 the US worked hard to organize and support its NATO allies, it was increasingly committed to helping Taiwan and was working assiduously to increase its friendships/alliances throughout the Indo-Pacific region.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png" width="593" height="420" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:420,&quot;width&quot;:593,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:269862,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/i/183032235?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D2U1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5d59a8-527b-4ce7-9343-8198e30e1249_593x420.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Pursuing Peace?

The US ended direct support for Ukraine and provided a great deal of diplomatic support and cover for Russia. It weakened, perhaps fatally, much of its alliance structure around the world. It entered trade wars with its friends and economically enhanced states that it used to see as its competitors. The USA even ended up codifying this new international reality in its 2025 <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/phillipspobrien/p/the-new-us-national-security-strategy?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">National Security Strategy</a>, which named European democracies as the great problem and handled Russia and China with kid gloves, arguably kindness.
