        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how congressional candidates are waiting due to uncertainty about redistricting maps. The infamous 2003 mid-decade redistricting—which prompted Democratic legislators to flee the state—explains why Texas redistricting remains contentious and how it shaped the current political landscape Democrats are trying to contest.</p>

Chelsea, the Chair of the Wichia County Democratic Party, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chellake4">said that at the JJ Dinner this weekend</a>, Texas Democratic Party Chair Kendall Scudder announced that Democrats would have a full ticket (as long as no one dropped before they filed). I immediately reached out to Scudder to confirm. He told me that the Texas Democrats have recruited candidates to run in every federal and state race, including the State House, State Senate, Congress, all Statewide seats, and the SBOE. </p><p>Big if true. (Like HUGE!!)</p><p>There are 14 days until the filing deadline, and I’ve been keeping track of who is on the ticket, according to the Secretary of State (SoS), here: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/who-will-be-on-the-2026-state-ballot">Who Will Be On The 2026 State Ballot?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/who-will-be-on-the-2026-federal-ballot">Who Will Be On The 2026 Federal Ballot?</a></p></li></ul><p>And Scudder reiterated, “We just have to make sure they file.” Which is fair, sometimes people back out at the last minute, for whatever reason. But even if we come close to filling the whole ticket, we’ll be doing pretty well. </p><p>But after not updating the lists over the weekend, I just updated them this evening and added many more Dems. And honestly, not that many Republicans, so I want to talk about some of what I’m seeing. How close are we to getting a full ticket? And how many more surprises can we expect?</p><h4>Congressional seats. </h4><p>Even though there are 14 days left for candidates to file, <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/11/challengers-to-texas-redistricting-map-urge-justices-to-strike-it-as-racially-discriminatory/">the outcome of the map remains unknown</a>. Right now, we have the 2025 maps, but that could change again, or not. Knowing that, a bunch of candidates will likely wait until the last moment. Will they be in this district or that? Maybe, depending on the district, they’ll decide not to run at all.  </p><p>It’s worth noting that most incumbents from the DFW, Travis County, or Bexar County areas have not yet filed for re-election. I definitely think a lot of people are holding out on filing for Congressional races until there is more certainty with the maps. </p><p>That being said, thus far, about 30 Dems are already on the ticket. Assuming that every incumbent or person who previously announced files, the only seat I haven’t heard anything about is TX36 (Brian Babin’s seat). And they may have someone for that seat, too, that’s waiting until the last minute to jump out. </p><h4>Playing Devil’s Advocate for a </h4>...</source>
