Donald Trump himself <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2026-election/trump-predicts-impeachment-if-republicans-lose-2026-midterms-rcna252604">expects it</a> if Democrats win the House in this year’s midterms, and we’ve already had previews. Scores of House Democrats voted to advance impeachment articles against Trump last month, articles have targeted at least three of his cabinet secretaries, and a bipartisan pair of lawmakers is <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/crime/epstein-files/congressmen-behind-epstein-files-law-draft-articles-of-impeachment-for-ag-bondi">drafting</a> charges against a fourth.</p><p>The growth of the Trump-era Impeachment Club is due to the sheer mass of Trump courtiers and enablers piling up abuses. And while it’s easy to be cynical or dismissive about these moves, the impeachment articles filed so far are not another round of politically weaponized vengeance. They read like simple statements of fact, the truth of what’s happening right before our eyes.</p><p>Practical or not, achievable or not at this moment in time, which of Trump’s illegal, unconstitutional and criminal acts does not warrant impeachment? Who among his wrecking-crew leadership does not deserve the same? “It’s not a presidency,” Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg has <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/simonwdc/p/its-not-a-presidency-its-a-crime">written</a>, “it’s a crime spree.” He said that less than a month ago, and the spree has escalated rapidly since then.</p><p>I have spent the past year in the stand-down-on-impeachment camp—even though I <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/trump-is-more-likely-to-get-a-third-impeachment-than-third-term-100-days">wrote</a> at Donald Trump’s 100-day mark in April that he had already matched or surpassed all the articles of impeachment brought against every past president. Impeachment <a href="https://www.editorialboard.com/the-key-to-impeachment-timing-69544dc56e78ce001a20b9fd/">seemed futile to me</a> at that point, although I conceded that “later it might not be.” My idea at the time was for Democrats to retake the House in the midterms and then move ahead with impeachment in 2027, with or without a Senate majority.</p><p>Then came last week—the week in which Trump used U.S. military forces to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and an ICE agent in Minneapolis killed U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good in her car.</p><p>Those deeply disturbing events spurred Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona to <a href="https://www.gallego.senate.gov/press-releases/gallego-introduces-amendment-to-block-military-force-against-greenland/">propose</a> two ways to <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/06/congress/greenland-war-powers-gallego-00712605">block</a> a Trump attack and takeover of Greenland, and the Senate to bar Trump from any further military activity in Venezuela without its authorization. Democrats started talking about impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois <a href="https://robinkelly.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-kelly-announces-plans-impeach-secretary-kristi-noem">announced</a> three impeachment articles against Noem.</p><p>And I realized with a jolt that later is already here.</p><p>Democrats should pinpoint and spotlight all the wrongs this year instead of waiting </p>...</source>
