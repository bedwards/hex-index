href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/11/penn-students-faculty-staff-occupy-building">The Daily Pennsylvanian</a></em>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Saturday’s resignation of University of Pennsylvania President Liz Magill came after months of controversy — and a viral-video grilling of Magill in a congressional hearing — over allegations the school has become a hotbed of antisemitism.</p><p>While those allegations have been given widespread credence, a <em>Stark Realities</em> analysis of dozens of claimed antisemitic incidents at Penn finds that, apart from a small handful of cases, the great majority are merely instances in which Penn students, professors and guest speakers engage in political expression that proponents of the State of Israel strongly disagree with. </p><p>Conveniently, a catalogue of supposed examples of anti-Jew bigotry at Penn is laid out in a federal lawsuit filed last week against the school by two Jewish students who allege it “has transformed itself into an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment, and discrimination.” In the suit, dual American-Israeli citizen Eyal Yakoby and American Jordan Davis seek “substantial damages in an amount to be determined at trial.”</p><p>For those wanting to look beyond what’s been said about Penn by grandstanding politicians, click-seeking news outlets and sensationalist social media posters, the <a href="https://www.kasowitz.com/media/focjlca0/university-of-pennsylvania-complaint.pdf">84-page complaint</a> is a valuable resource. Unlike the sloppy court of public opinion, real courts demand a detailed presentation of specific allegations. </p><p>However, scrutiny of the Penn complaint — prepared by Philadelphia lawyer and Penn law grad <a href="https://www.1800cantwork.com/attorney-profiles/">Eric Shore</a> and New York City law firm<a href="https://www.kasowitz.com/media/client-news/kasowitz-files-lawsuit-against-university-of-pennsylvania-on-behalf-of-jewish-students-alleging-egregious-civil-rights-violations-for-its-antisemitic-hostile-educational-environment/"> Kasowitz Benson Torres</a> —&nbsp;confirms the campaign against the Philadelphia school is just the latest component a broader, long-running drive to censor political expression that’s critical of the State of Israel and sympathetic to Palestinians. </p><p>In support of that drive, conservatives who’d previously and rightfully bashed campus viewpoint censorship and crackdowns on flexibly-defined “hate speech” are among the most vocal advocates of installing a new censorship regime to keep students “safe” from anti-Israel rhetoric.  </p><h2>Political Views Wrongly Labelled as Antisemitic </h2><p>Objective readers of the complaint will quickly note a number of red flags, starting with strident, vitriolic language referring to “rabidly antisemitic professors” and “Jew-hating” speakers who “spew antisemitic venom” by “bellowing into bullhorns to express their hatred for Israel.” </p><p>However, the complaint’s foremost flaw is its repeated assumption that various political concepts, views and slogans promoted by critics of Israel are inherently antisemitic or genocidal. This kind of attack isn’t unique to the Penn complaint; it’s constantly used </p>...</source>
