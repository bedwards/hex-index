        <p class="topic-summary">The STC&#039;s demand for renewed southern independence directly references the historical People&#039;s Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen), which existed as a separate socialist state from 1967-1990. Understanding this history explains why southern separatism persists and why the STC&#039;s &#039;State of South Arabia&#039; declaration carries such weight.</p>

Price hikes, extreme floods, and aid cuts have all contributed to worsening conditions in 2025. Half of the population in anti-Houthi territory is food insecure, with 15% classified as one step from the international classification of famine.</p><p>Controversy surrounds the supposed disbanding and the fate of the STC leadership. A delegation of more than 50 STC leaders flew from Aden  to the Saudi capital on January 7 to take part in a conference Saudi Arabia said was being held to discuss Yemen’s southern issue and the separatist STC’s demand for renewed independence from Yemen’s north.</p><p>Instead of joining the group, STC leader al-Zubaydi instead secretly left by boat to Somaliland and then boarded a plane to the UAE.
