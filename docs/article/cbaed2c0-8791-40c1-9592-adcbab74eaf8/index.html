Wenchi is a thought leader on Asia, with her career Her career spanning multiple sectors, including the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Congress, and Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Here is the summary of my one-hour long podcast:</p><p>#### Growing Up in the Rustbelt Province of Jilin</p><p>Wang describes his childhood in Jilin province, part of China’s northeastern rustbelt, as marked by economic hardship and industrial decline. He notes that after the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the region saw significant development of heavy industries over the first 20-30 years, much like the U.S. rustbelt states.

One day, tuning into the family radio, he discovered the “English 900” program on Voice of America (VOA), hosted by a woman with a sweet Beijing accent who had immigrated to the U.S. This, along with BBC’s “Follow Me” program aired on Chinese state TV, influenced generations born in the 1950s-1970s. “English 900” was originally designed to teach English in Taiwan and later adapted for mainland listeners.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him at the time, listening to VOA was illegal in China from the 1950s to the 1980s, labeled as “listening to enemy radio” and punishable by imprisonment.
