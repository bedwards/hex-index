      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>In my book, <a href="https://a.co/d/cPsM4Ql">Co-Intelligence</a>, I outlined a way that people could work with AI, which was, rather unsurprisingly, as a co-intelligence. Teamed with a chatbot, humans could use AI as a sort of intern or co-worker, correcting its errors, checking its work, co-developing ideas, and guiding it in the right direction. Over the past few weeks, I have come to believe that co-intelligence is still important but that the nature of AI is starting to point in a different direction. We're moving from partners to audience, from collaboration to conjuring.</p><p>A good way to illustrate this change is to ask an AI to explain what has happened since I wrote the book. I fed my book and all 140 or so One Useful Thing posts (incidentally, I can’t believe I have written that many posts!) into <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/">NotebookLM</a> and chose the new video overview option with a basic prompt to make a video about what has happened in the world of AI.</p><p>A few minutes later, I got this. And it is pretty good. Good enough that I think it is worth watching to get an update on what has happened since my book was written.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;a840e54f-68ba-4428-9545-a1a62a5598a4&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>But how did the AI pick the points it made? I don’t know, but they were pretty good. How did it decide on the slides to use? I don’t know, but they were also pretty on target (though images remain a bit of a weak point, as it didn’t show me the promised otter). Was it right? That seemed like something I should check.</p><p>So, I went through the video several times, checking all the facts. It got all the numbers right, including the data on <a href="https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/">MMLU scores</a> and the results of AI performance on the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.06.23288265v1">neurosurgery exam data</a> (I am not even sure when I cited that material). My only real issue was that it should have noted that<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321"> I was one of several co-authors in our study </a>of Boston Consulting Group that also introduced the term “jagged frontier.” Also, I wouldn’t have said everything the way the AI did (it was a little bombastic, and my book is not out-of-date yet!), but there were no substantive errors.</p><p>I think this process is typical of the new wave of AI, for an increasing range of complex tasks, you get an amazing and sophisticated output in response to a vague request, but you have ...</p>
