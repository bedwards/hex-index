        <h4>the irritable searching after reasons</h4><p>There are days when I feel so sick of trying to justify literature that I no longer want to try. What need do we have of reasons and arguments in the face of poetry? Art justifies itself. Like the growing of a great tree or a bird song heard on the breeze, art finds its place in the world. </p><p>It is the “state of the humanities”, and the state of the “discourse”, which make this issue all rather vexed and vexing. Why so much debate about Great Books programs? </p><p>Not only am I far more alarmed about the fertility crisis, I just don’t see how this all hinges on undergraduate education—too often, an undergraduate education that involves very little writing. When I was at Oxford we wrote between two and six thousand words of essay every week. I cannot find the necessary sense of alarm that some of America’s future lawyers and engineers might miss the chance to go to two dozen seminars and write <em>two essays in total</em>. There are literature PhDs who haven’t even read Chaucer for God’s sake. If we can’t do it, why should they?<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>If they need this learning so badly for instrumental reasons, why can’t they do it at school, at the library, at their grandmother’s knee? Yes, yes, I know, our grandmothers no longer read Dickens aloud as it was read to them. But that is rather <em>my</em> point. Literature has already gone out with the tide as a central part of culture. Shakespeare’s audience had the choice of a brothel, an inn, or a bear-baiting pit when they left the Globe. There was no Netflix, no radio, no Twitter. That was then, this is now. Go to the pub with a group of highly educated people. One thing they will all have in common is a working knowledge of the sitcoms of their youth. <em>Friends</em>, or <em>The Simpsons</em>. A few charts about the decline of reading won’t make it 1852 again. </p><p>I sound confused because I feel confused. We don’t need arguments for the humanities. No-one argues that we need bees or flowers or summer rain. Obviously it is good and necessary to have the academic humanities. </p><p>If you don’t understand that, you don’t need me to make you another numbered list or to find the right form of words to make it ...</p>
