        <p class="topic-summary">Wayne Hsiung directly discusses how Open Rescue evolved from ALF tactics, and how Peter Singer&#039;s work inspired the movement. Understanding ALF&#039;s history and methods provides essential context for the philosophical and tactical evolution discussed in the interview.</p>
