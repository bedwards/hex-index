        <p>Today we’re going to take a look at Prime Minister Alexandru Munteanu’s new cabinet of ministers. Following the <a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/p/the-new-government-presents-their">presentation of the government program</a> and vote of confidence on Friday October 31st, the new government <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/video-pravitelstvo-muntyanu-prinosit-prisyagu">was sworn in</a> by President Sandu on November 1st. Speaking on the occasion, the <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/sandu-novomu-pravitelstvu-obem-raboty-bespreczedenten-no-lyudi-jdut-rezultatov">President stated</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>“We need a government that prioritizes development, attracting investment, and increasing the competitiveness of the economy. Only then will we be able to improve people’s living standards and strengthen the rule of law,”</em></p></blockquote><p>Prime Minister Munteanu has made it abundantly clear that his government will prioritize economic development. So who is in this government? and who will be responsible for carrying out this agenda? </p><p>The new cabinet has 16 members, 8 of whom are holdovers from the last government and 8 who are new.  We’re going to go through each of the 16 members of the cabinet with a brief introduction and, when warranted, a short analysis of what their appointment might signal. This is a lot of information so we’re going to split our article into 2 parts. We’ll cluster them thematically as follows: </p><h4>Part 1: </h4><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/cluster-foreign-affairs-and-transnistria">Cluster 1: Foreign Affairs &amp; Transnistria</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/deputy-prime-minister-for-european-integration">Deputy Prime Minister for European Integration</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/deputy-prime-minister-for-foreign-affairs">Deputy Prime Minister for Foreign Affairs</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/deputy-prime-minister-for-reintegration">Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/cluster-economics-finance-and-regional-development">Cluster 2: Economics, Finance and Regional Development</a></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/deputy-prime-minister-and-minister-of-economic-development-and-digitalization-aka-minister-of-economy">Deputy Prime Minister &amp; Minister of Economic Development and Digitalization</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/deputy-prime-minister-and-minister-of-infrastructure-and-regional-development">Deputy Prime Minister &amp; Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/minister-of-finance">Minister of Finance</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/minister-of-agriculture-and-food-industry">Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/177868748/minister-of-energy">Minister of Energy</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Part 2: (Coming later this week) </h4><ul><li><p>Cluster 3: Social Welfare</p><ul><li><p>Minister of Education and Research</p></li><li><p>Minister of Labour and Social Protection</p></li><li><p>Minister of Health</p></li><li><p>Minister of Culture</p></li><li><p>Minister of the Environment</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Cluster 4: Power Ministries</p><ul><li><p>Minister of Internal Affairs</p></li><li><p>Minister of Defence</p></li><li><p>Minister of Justice</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><em><strong>Note 1</strong>: The clusters above are my own and don’t reflect an official structure. Also, don’t read too much into the ordering. I’ve chosen to put Deputy Prime Ministers at the top of each section and then to more or less order the others at random.</em> </p><p><em><strong>Note 2</strong>: This article is probably not going to fully load in your email (lots of pictures).
