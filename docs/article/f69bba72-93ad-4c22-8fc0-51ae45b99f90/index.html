        <p>Texting and driving is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>… Or at the very least, doing so hinders our ability to drive.</p><p>We both know this. The statistics know this.</p><p>Yet, there has certainly been a time or two when I’ve sent a quick text to my girlfriend behind the wheel.</p><p>And I’m willing to bet you can relate…</p><p>But I’m not here to lecture you on your driving responsibility…</p><p>Nonetheless, there’s a reason I bring up texting and driving…</p><p><strong>Doing more things does not drive faster or better results.</strong></p><p>When you text <em>and</em> drive…you don’t drive better. You drive worse.</p><p><strong>Doing things better drives better results.</strong></p><p>Even more:</p><p><strong>Doing one thing as best as you can drives better results.</strong></p><p>See, we’re capable of doing two things at the same time — like texting and driving.</p><p>However, it’s impossible to concentrate on two tasks at once. You can only do one thing at a time.</p><p>What’s my point?</p><p>I promise this email isn’t a “trojan horse” lecture to get you to stop texting and driving…</p><p>Although, you should probably cut that out (just saying)…</p><p>What you should take away from this lesson is to <strong>do one thing at a time.</strong></p><p>That’s it.</p><p>Just one.</p><p>Whether that be implementing <em>one</em> new system... Learning <em>one</em> new skill… Or focusing on <em>one</em> project at a time.</p><p>At the end of the day…</p><p><strong>Do less, not more.</strong></p><p>When you do, you’ll get more profits, freedom, and impact.</p><p>And right now is the perfect opportunity for you because my Elite Performers Retirement Celebration sale is live.</p><p>This is a big milestone for me, so I wanted to celebrate properly.</p><p>You can get <em>one</em> big, brilliant bundle of all 12 workshops I’ve created in the past 12 months…</p><p>… Or you can even just buy any <em>one</em> workshop (or a handful).</p><p>They all come with the original bonuses, templates, etc.</p><p><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">​</a><strong><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">&gt;&gt;&gt;Do less, not more</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">​</a></p><p>Dan</p><p>P.S. — Heads up, I’m leaning toward raising the price on this bundle soon.</p>
