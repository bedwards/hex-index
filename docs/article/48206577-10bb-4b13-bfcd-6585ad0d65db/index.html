During a recent podcast <a href="https://youtu.be/qpBDB2NjaWY">interview</a>, Andreessen said that being a venture capitalist may be a profession that is "literally timeless":</p><blockquote><p>So much of what a venture capitalist firm is are its relationships with the world, because to build a company, you end up needing a lot of relationships… it’s possible that that is quite literally timeless. And when, you know, when the AI is doing everything else, that may be one of the last remaining fields that people are still doing</p></blockquote><p>On the one hand, it’s funny to hear Andreessen repeating with a straight face the famous last words of every future unemployed person when they first hear about the invention to replace them: “technology-schmechtology, it simply won’t be able to do what I do.”</p><p>What's even funnier is that he said this on the same broadcast in which he admitted that venture capitalists are very bad at their job:</p><blockquote><p>Every great venture capitalist in the last 70 years has missed most of the great companies of his generation... The great VCs have a success rate of getting, I don't know, two out of 10 of the great companies of the decade, right?</p></blockquote><p>Probably because “discovering great companies of one’s generation” isn’t really their job. In reality, a venture capitalist's job is to find companies that can be hyped up and sold to suckers long before they realize that the company has no idea how to make the money that would justify its valuation.</p><blockquote><p>This isn't the traditional capitalist story of "you win some, you lose some." The point isn't that venture capitalists sometimes invest in companies that don't make their money back. The point is that the entire model deployed by VCs is to profit by disrupting the marketplace with predatory pricing, and leave the losses to the suckers who buy into the IPO. A company that engages in predatory pricing and its late-stage investors might not recoup, but the venture investors do.<br><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/venture-capital-big-tech-antitrust-predatory-pricing-uber-wework-bird-2023-7">New research reveals that Silicon Valley uses predatory pricing to crush competitors and scam investors</a></em></p></blockquote><p>But the real reason for Andreessen's calm is that the nature of his work has nothing to do with the stability </p>...</source>
