No more bending ourselves into pretzels in an attempt to carry on with a situation that is no longer working. It’s time to fish or cut bait! And it’s time to get things moving! When Jupiter enters the sign of Cancer on June 10, three of the five slow-moving planets will be in signs of cardinal mode for the next three months, signaling to us as a collective to finally take heart, take the initiative and move on into new territory this summer!</p><p><strong>Should I seize the opportunity or not?</strong></p><p>This shift into leadership-mode will not go unchallenged, though, as what is already established might clash with newly emerging directions and perspectives. Before Jupiter, the planet of optimism and opportunities, can get too comfortable in the sign of Cancer, he will immediately get a scrutinizing side-eye from Saturn, who will probably have a few sobering facts and tests up his sleeve to keep the planet of expansion within bounds. Of course, I’m talking about this month’s signature configuration, the Jupiter-Saturn square, which will become exact on June 15<sup>th</sup>. In the run-up to its exactitude some of you might feel an increasing tension not unlike two tectonic plates rubbing against each other.</p><p>If you have significant planetary placements at the very beginning of the cardinal signs of Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn, you might be especially sensitive to this increasing pressure. You could find yourself in a situation in which major shifts need to be initiated or you might be about to take a significant step yourself – whether internally or externally. You might be conflicted now, but if you know what matters most to you, in a few months from now you could look back and realize that June was the crucial month when things were set in motion or you made up your mind. So, in the first two weeks in June life could force us to (re-)examine whether we are ready to take the next step - and consider what is needed to take the next step.</p><p>Jupiter and Saturn are the so-called social planets, meaning that the dynamics they are involved in often manifests visibly in our society and manifest in the area of legislation. If you don’t have planetary placements in your birth </p>...</source>
