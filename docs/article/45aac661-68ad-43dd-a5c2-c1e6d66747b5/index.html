        <p>Happy Monday, and welcome to the seventh edition of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on McLennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. First, I wanted to apologize for being absent the last couple of weeks. I had six final exams this quarter, my sister’s wedding, and a campaign kickoff followed by two block walking weekends with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Hope4WacoISD">Hope for Waco ISD</a>. I feel sufficiently rested, excited about this new quarter, and ready to get back into the swing of things.</p><p>In other news, I have decided to maintain my focus on writing my own original content, rather than venturing into the world of interviewing. I will continue to write (with a little more regularity) and my intention is to launch a podcast sometime this Summer.</p><p>While I do apologize for the tardiness of these recommendations, I am guessing that any of you who voted in the first week of early voting likely did your research. If you would like to see a <strong>sample of what your voting precinct’s ballot will look like</strong>, <a href="https://tx-mclennancounty.civicplus.com/DocumentCenter/View/12655/Sample-Ballots-by-Precinct--website">click here.</a> If you want some information on <strong>where and when to early vote</strong>, <a href="https://www.co.mclennan.tx.us/1176/March-1-2022-Joint-General-Election">click here.</a> Election Day is March 1st from 7 AM to 7 PM. For those of you still trying to sort through all of the candidates, I hope that this helps!<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><h4>Candidate Recommendations for the March 2022 Democratic Primary</h4><p><strong>For U.S. House District 17: <a href="https://maryjowoodstx17.com">Mary Jo Woods</a></strong></p><p>Mary Jo Woods is the sole Democratic candidate for the 17th congressional district, and she is running on a platform of supporting rural America, preserving democracy, and fighting for gender equality. Given that this new district takes in large swaths of rural Texas, it is important that any candidate for this seat runs on rural issues. While this is a difficult seat to run for, I believe there are lots of opportunities to close the gap. This district has three large universities (Baylor, Sam Houston, and Stephen F. Austin), has large communities of color, and will likely continue to trend left. </p><p><strong>For Texas House District 56: <a href="https://www.erinshankfortexashouse.com">Erin Shank</a></strong></p><p>I am really, really excited about Erin’s run for House District 56. I have had the pleasure of working with Erin as a Democratic activist and as a legal intern in her bankruptcy law practice. She is passionate, highly intelligent, and more than qualified to serve in the Texas House. From the jump, Erin has ...</p>
