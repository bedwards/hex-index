        <p><em>Happy Thanksgiving break to all my friends, comrades, coders, and luddites. Thankful for all of you readers fighting for the user out there. With that, here’s a special Black Friday edition of Blood in the Machine.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>I finally cancelled Spotify. I’d been meaning to do this forever, and frankly I’m embarrassed it took me so long. Spotify has been driving down wages for artists far longer than the AI companies, reducing payouts for musicians over the years until most are now making a statistically meaningless amount from the platform; many estimates put the figure as low as $0.003 per stream. In 2024, Spotify stopped paying artists for songs that had fewer than 1,000 streams, despite the fact that <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/only-19-of-artists-on-spotify-had-over-1000-monthly-listeners-in-20231/">81% of musicians</a> on the platform don’t cross that threshold.</p><p>Stories abound of successful artists with millions of monthly listeners who <a href="https://fortune.com/article/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream/">can’t afford</a> to take a vacation, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/arts/music/streaming-music-payments.html">a break</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/24/nadine-shah-i-cant-pay-the-rent-on-unfair-music-streaming-revenues">pay rent</a>. The pop star Lily Allen says <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lily-allen-feet-pictures-make-more-money-spotify-streams-1235811354/">she makes more money selling pics of her feet on OnlyFans</a> than she does from Spotify royalties. Meanwhile, Spotify just raked in <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/spotify-q3-earnings-paying-subscribers-hit-281-million-1236606325/">nearly $700 million in quarterly profits</a>. It’s rank exploitation. Don’t take it from me, take it from Bjork. Earlier this year, she <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/bjork-spotify-streaming-worst-thing-for-musicians-1236285477/">succinctly described</a> Spotify as “probably the worst thing that has happened to musicians,” thanks to how the company, and the streaming model it normalized, has so completely corroded artists’ incomes over the last decade or so. </p><p>Meanwhile, the company <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/08/nx-s1-5492314/ai-music-streaming-services-spotify">declines to label the AI songs</a> that are overrunning the platform and even boosts them into Discover Weekly playlists, incentivizing their spread. Founder and CEO Daniel Ek used his Spotify fortune to invest in a lethal military tech startup, prompting the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/artists-left-spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-military-tech-1235425098/">most recent round of artist boycotts</a> from the platform. I could go on, but that will probably do—Spotify is everything that’s wrong with Silicon Valley’s engagement with culture and labor condensed into a single platform. Plus, the audio quality sucks. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png" width="1456" height="1129" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1129,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:299994,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/i/179993332?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UcGo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F24f9c290-6f93-4f91-8e31-63dabf6f8f6b_1826x1416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Greetings from up on my high horse.

I justified staying by telling myself I’d use Bandcamp to buy the albums and songs I listened to a lot, which I did, while using Spotify for convenience. That, and the same reasons I still use Gmail: I felt locked in (all those saved songs and playlists) and that the costs of switching would be too high </p>...</source>
