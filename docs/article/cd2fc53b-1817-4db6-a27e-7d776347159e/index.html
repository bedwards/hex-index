        <p>If you’re stressed out at work this week, console yourself that you’re handling it a bit better than Justice Department attorney Julie Le, who told a Minnesota federal judge yesterday she’s been so overwhelmed by the immigration-related <em>habeas corpus</em> motions assigned to her that she’d like to be held in contempt just so she could get some sleep. “The system sucks,” she said, <a href="https://x.com/PaulBlume_FOX9/status/2018785125857902645">according to local news</a>. “This job sucks.” That’s something we can all agree on. <em><strong>Happy Wednesday.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg" width="1456" height="972" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:972,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:18016261,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/i/186854093?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vTHP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd1edbbc-5fc1-49bf-86d9-18e5124682f3_6016x4016.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">ICE deploys pepper balls, tear gas, and flashbang grenades on hundreds of people who marched from Portland City Hall to the ICE facility to protest the agency in Portland, Oregon, on February 01, 2026.

The fight is going about as well as anyone could have hoped.</p><p>Yesterday, the House <a href="https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/government-shutdown-ice-dhs-vote-congress">passed</a> a spending bill reopening the government after a few days of partial shutdown. The bill funds the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, State, and Treasury until this fall. The Department of Homeland Security, however, is funded only for an additional two weeks under the package.</p><p>To some progressives, even this is an intolerable concession. Speaking ahead of the vote, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) summed up the line of thought: “Not only should ICE receive NO funding, it should be abolished.”</p><p>Should ICE be abolished? That’s a policy fight Democrats will get to have among themselves if they’re lucky enough to win unified control of government in the next few years. But the idea that it is an achievable policy aim in the immediate term is a fantasy. Shutting down the government for enormous periods of time might be good for raising public awareness of a given issue, but it doesn’t magically create consensus for your view. Democrats’ shutdown play last year couldn’t even squeeze Republicans into reinstating a status-quo Obamacare subsidy; the idea that they’d have better luck vaporizing ICE is ridiculous.
