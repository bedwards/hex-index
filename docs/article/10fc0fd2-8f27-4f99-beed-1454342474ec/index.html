          <strong>Prospero</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with and structures itself around quotes from Shakespeare&#039;s The Tempest, using Prospero as a framing device for breaking political &#039;spells.&#039; Understanding Prospero&#039;s role as a sorcerer who controls through magic and illusion directly illuminates the author&#039;s metaphorical framework.</p>

          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Russian cultivation since the 1980s and Kremlin-benefiting policies. Active measures is the Soviet/Russian term for political warfare operations including disinformation and influence campaigns, providing crucial historical context for these claims.</p>

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author uses &#039;folie du pays&#039; (madness of the country) as a key concept, a deliberate variation on this psychiatric term for shared delusion. Understanding the clinical phenomenon of how delusions spread between people illuminates the article&#039;s central thesis about collective political enchantment.</p>
