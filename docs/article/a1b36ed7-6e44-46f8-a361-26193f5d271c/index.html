I really like the city: off the Strip, it resembles other growing, diverse Sunbelt metros like Raleigh, Houston and Nashville, full of fantastic strip-mall restaurants and middle-class housing. But it also serves as a laboratory for economic experimentation.</p><p>And because state regulators obsessively track the gambling industry’s performance — tourism reflects <a href="https://www.nevadaresorts.org/impact/">more than a third of Nevada’s economy</a> — Vegas is a surprisingly data-rich environment. So, for instance, we might ask questions like these: How much additional profit can you squeeze out of your customers before they rebel? Even if you’re doing it in ways that initially might be hard for them to notice?</p><p>A slump in tourism this year suggests that Vegas may have passed its saturation point. Once a town of penny slots and cheap buffets, Vegas no longer feels like a good value to middle-class consumers.</p><p>This is, I’ll admit, not precisely a contrarian theory. Complaints about how Vegas has become a bad bargain often pop into my “For You” feed. Nonetheless, I knew something was off when I booked hotels for my annual World Series of Poker trip late this spring. What constitutes “cheap” is a matter of perspective. But I know the Las Vegas Strip hotels and their typical price points extremely well. (There’s even a Las Vegas Strip hotel guide in a <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/sbsq-16-nates-incomplete-guide-to">past SBSQ</a>.) Everything was priced down a tier: rooms that would typically go for $269 a night were priced at $189, rooms that would cost $189 went for $109, and anything under that was basically being given away for free if you had any sort of casino status.</p><p>Despite these discounted prices, in June and July — the main months for the WSOP — visitor volumes fell by 11.3 percent and 12.0 percent, respectively, as compared to the same months in 2024, according to data from the city’s <a href="https://www.lvcva.com/research/reports/post/lvcva-executive-summary-of-southern-nevada-tourism-indicators/">Convention and Visitors Authority</a>. The year on the whole hadn’t been quite as bad, with tourism down 7.6 percent for the first ten months of the year as compared to January-October 2024. Still, the numbers are on pace to reflect the biggest year-over-year drop in tourist arrivals on record — except for the COVID year in 2020. The decline in revenues projects to be even steeper because the average </p>...</source>
