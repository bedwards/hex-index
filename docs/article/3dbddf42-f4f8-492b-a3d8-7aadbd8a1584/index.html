Whether you can leave, though, is another question.&nbsp;</p><p>In July, Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/26/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-join-spotify-exodus-over-arms-industry-link-ntwnfb?ref=platformer.news"><u>pulled their music from the streaming platform</u></a>. The group left in protest of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek leading a €600 million investment in Helsing, a German company that makes military drones and AI tools for weapons systems.</p><p>“We just removed our music from the platform,” the company wrote in an <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-pulls-music-off-spotify-1236470802/?ref=platformer.news"><u>Instagram post</u></a>. “Can we put pressure on these Dr. Evil tech bros to do better? Join us on another platform.”</p><p>Over the next several days, most of the band’s catalog disappeared from the site. Visit the band’s artist page on Spotify today and you’ll find a single song — a remix the band did for another artist.</p><p>But for some of the band’s other tracks, a strange thing happened. Browsing playlists of King Gizzard’s songs, some fans noticed that several tracks were still available —&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>. Cue up “Deadstick,” a song off the band’s 2025 record <em>Phantom Island</em>, and what you hear is a kind of ringtone version of the original.&nbsp;</p><p>“Spotify presented this as being the real thing: i.e. same artist name, same song name, same video artwork,” Gizzard fan Scott Harvey told me. “And the music is similar. If I didn't know the song already, I may not have known this wasn't the original.”</p><p>“Deadstick” was not the only track to have been swapped out for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzak?ref=platformer.news"><u>Muzak</u></a> equivalent. The record’s title track, “Aerodynamic,” and “Grow Wings and Fly” were all also replaced by instrumentals. Until I asked, they remained playable on <em>Phantom Island</em> album page on Spotify, and collectively had more than 10 million streams.</p><p>I shared what I found with the band's manager, and will update this piece with a comment from the band should they offer one.</p><p>Who is behind the doppelgänger tracks? Harvey noticed something strange when he tapped on “view album” while listening to “Deadstick.” It took him to a new album page where the artist name had been replaced with the likely creator of the instrumental track: an entity known as “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Mqqhv142INHdckA5akxpC?si=ww1c_I7pQyCb4FxcR1VdUw&amp;ref=platformer.news"><u>Jayilor</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Who or what is Jayilor? A web search turns up only playlists on which its music features. And what kind of music does it make? Instrumental, Muzak-style covers of popular songs. One of ...</p>
