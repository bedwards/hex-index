        <h3>Howdy cookbook fans!</h3><p>And welcome to a very, very, <em>very</em> special issue of Stained Page News. This is the issue where I FINALLY reveal the project I’ve been hinting at in this newsletter for years, a project that I think is worth the wait. Because it’s easily the best project I’ve ever worked on—proud is an understatement.</p><p>I am talking about <em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709644/cured-by-steve-mchugh-with-paula-forbes/">Cured: Cooking with Ferments, Pickles, Preserves, &amp; More</a></strong></em> by <strong>Steve McHugh</strong> with <strong>Paula Forbes</strong>.

Because Steve’s specialty is charcuterie, it’s “cured” like hams and other meats. But also this is the restaurant he dreamed up with his wife Sylvia while he was being treated for non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma over a decade ago, a restaurant that would be a light at the end of the tunnel during treatment.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709644/cured-by-steve-mchugh-with-paula-forbes/">Cured</a></strong></em> now has another meaning: it’s a cookbook. Or it will be, when it comes out in March. And it’s one hell of a cookbook, at that. With over 150 recipes, <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709644/cured-by-steve-mchugh-with-paula-forbes/">Cured</a></em> aims to teach home cooks how to cook with preserved foods. It has recipes for sauerkraut and pickles and jams, yes. <strong>But the bulk of the recipes are not for preserved foods, they </strong><em><strong>use</strong></em><strong> preserved foods.</strong> These are dishes that can be made with store-bought mustards and salad dressings and spice blends and sundried tomatoes. Because <strong>this is a book that is less about </strong><em><strong>how</strong></em><strong> to make preserved foods, and more about </strong><em><strong>why</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><h2>After all, cooking with preserved foods is just a fancy, cheffy way of saying pantry cooking.</h2><p>So why are chefs like Steve obsessed with preservation?! Plenty of cookbooks will tell you how to put food in a jar. This one will tell you what to do with it once you take off the lid—whether that lid reveals homegrown strawberry jam or a tub of supermarket strawberry ice cream. And once you’ve figured out that why? Our hope is </p>...</source>
