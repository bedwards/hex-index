        <h3>Some life updates.</h3><p>It’s been almost a year since I last sent out an edition of this newsletter. A lot has happened in that time. I moved to a new city in a new country (if you’re based in the Bay Area and want to grab a coffee, say hi!). I also joined <a href="https://firstcheckhq.medium.com/firstcheck-africa-adds-2m-commitment-from-tlcom-to-its-10m-debut-fund-9d3899cfcfe5">FirstCheck Africa</a> &amp; <a href="https://ralicap.com/">Ralicap</a> as a Venture Partner (if you’re building a pre-seed or seed stage company in Africa or Latin America, say hi!). I’ve also settled into a new role at <a href="https://endeavor.org/">Endeavor</a> - focused on helping our entrepreneurs find the right capital partners. </p><h3><strong>Some newsletter updates.</strong> </h3><p>It’s been hard to put out this newsletter while settling into a new country and juggling multiple new commitments. I have about 3 unpublished articles in my drafts that I’ve started and just haven’t been able to take to completion. </p><p>I’ve decided to experiment with a new format for the newsletter. I’ll be modeling it very closely after <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/newsletter">Benedict Evan’s</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Matt Levine’s</a> newsletters. Meaning I’ll mostly do a mix commentary and curation on the most important news in technology. </p><p>I’ll still focus on emerging markets. Mostly Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA, LATAM, and Asia. I don’t know what the publishing schedule will be, but hopefull I can get something out once a month. I’ll still put out longer pieces whenever I have a topic to explore and my schedule permits it.</p><p>There are a handful of other changes coming to the newsletter in the next few weeks/months. Stay tuned. </p><p>On to the newsletter. </p><h3><strong>A new era for Softbank in Latin America</strong></h3><p>There’s a really nice article in protocol that explores <a href="https://www.protocol.com/vc-latam-thesis">the rise of the VC ecosystem in Latin America</a>. It heavily quotes a handful of investors including former Softbank Managing Partner, Shu Nyatta. It also pretty extensively features the Softbank Latin America fund - arguably the most important investor in the region over the past few years. </p><p>In the 5 years from 2014-2018, Latin America received $4.7B in venture capital funding. Then in March of 2019, Softbank announced a $5B fund focused entirely on the region. A month later, it would announce a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-investment-rappi/japans-softbank-invests-1-billion-in-delivery-app-rappi-idUSKCN1S619Y">$1B investment</a> into just one company - Rappi. In 2021, Softbank would announce a plan to commit a further $3B to Latin America. Given the amount of interest in Latin America today, it’s easy to forget how big of a deal the Softbank Latin America fund (then ...</p>
