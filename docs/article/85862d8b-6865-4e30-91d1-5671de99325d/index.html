We then invited you, our readers, to share acts of kindness that left a lasting impression, perhaps even reshaping the way you see the world.</p><p>What you sent us was compelling, heartwarming and refreshingly unexpected, reminding us that goodness is alive and well in a world often overshadowed by displays of cruelty and grim headlines.</p><p>Do small acts of kindness really matter? We’ll let your stories speak for themselves. (But the answer is yes. Always yes.)</p><p>Here are some of the highlights.</p><p><strong>Teacher Steps Up</strong></p><p>When I was in second grade, my only pair of shoes was worn out, with holes in the soles. At that time, my parents couldn’t afford to buy me new ones, so I wasn’t able to go to school. My teacher, Mrs. Wortz, called my mom to find out why I wasn’t in school. My mom told her the truth, even though it was probably embarrassing. Mrs. Wortz replied, “Get her ready for school in the morning and I will come pick her up.”</p><p>The next morning, my teacher drove me straight to a Buster Brown shoe store and bought me a new pair of shoes.</p><p>After Mrs. Wortz retired and moved to a smaller house, she called and gave me her library of books. I was an avid reader and loved books. Still do. Her kindness made a huge difference in my life. I will never forget it.</p><p>Teresa Staats<br>Ohio</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/24/barn-emmett-till-sacred-site/">Giving thanks today for this group of folks. May we never forget.</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>The long-hidden monument to bigotry and brutality — the Mississippi Delta barn where Emmett Till was tortured and killed in 1955 — will soon become a “sacred site” for all to see.</p><p>On Monday, the Emmett Till Interpretive Center <a href="http://emmett-till.org/barn">announced</a> that it had purchased the barn, thanks to a $1.5 million gift from TV producer Shonda Rhimes, who was moved to donate after reading about the barn, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/shonda-rhimes-honor-emmett-tills-story-new-passion/story?id=105699839">saying</a>, “My hope is that this story never gets lost.” …</p><p>For Keith Beauchamp, producer of </p></blockquote>...</source>
