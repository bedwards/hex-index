        <p>Well, folks, buckle up. </p><p>Tomorrow, ACIP—the advisory committee that guides U.S. vaccine policy—meets again for two days. This group has enormous influence on your access to vaccines: its decisions shape vaccine supply, insurance coverage (including Medicaid), clinicians’ understanding of what to offer you, how many doses hospitals and pharmacies stock, and the public’s confidence in what, where, when, and how to get your vaccines.</p><p>This meeting will focus on two things: </p><ol><li><p>Hepatitis B vaccine, including a vote that could meaningfully affect infant access in the U.S. </p></li><li><p>The<em> entire</em> childhood immunization schedule, including its history, the number of doses, ingredients like aluminum, and whatever else they may pull out of their hat. </p></li></ol><p>It’s going to be a ride. Mainly because a few months ago, RFK Jr. overhauled the committee, replacing long-standing experts with individuals ranging from longtime vaccine skeptics to Covid-19 contrarians.</p><p>So, here’s your guide to what to expect, including a proactive heads-up on the misleading claims likely to surface and a breakdown of the fallacies behind them. Whether you’re a clinician answering questions, a parent scrolling social media, or simply someone trying to find clarity in the chaos, I hope this is helpful.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>Note: As I <a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/your-acip-pre-bunk-guide">shared</a> with paid subscribers yesterday, together with <a href="https://www.evicollective.org/">The Evidence Collective (TEC)</a>, we wrote a much deeper pre-bunk <a href="https://www.evicollective.org/2025-dec-acip-prebunk">HERE</a> that includes key background on all anticipated ACIP topics, practical communication guidance, a fallacy playbook, and a rundown of the falsehoods and rumors likely to surface. Below is a high-level summary.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>What to expect</h3><p>Credible sources suggest none—or very few—of the ACIP presentations will be delivered by CDC scientists or experts. Instead, external groups, including some with clear anti-vaccine track records, are slated to take the lead. <strong>This is highly unusual,</strong> and I’m incredibly concerned that data will be misinterpreted and misleading, and false claims will be presented as expert testimony. </p><p>Reviewing the timing, spacing, and risks of each vaccine requires scientific expertise because the stakes are high: get the evidence or timing wrong—or lose sight of the historical reasons behind these recommendations—and preventable diseases can come roaring back. And once falsehoods are aired in this forum, they can spread quickly, potentially amplified by one of the nation’s highest offices.</p><p>But there <em>is</em> good news.</p><ol><li><p><em><strong>There is no vote for the childhood vaccination schedule as a whole. </strong></em>They will only discuss it. This means timing, spacing, and availability to you won’t change.<em> <strong>The only </strong></em></p></li>...</ol>
