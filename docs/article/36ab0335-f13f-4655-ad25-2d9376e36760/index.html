We are walking over cool deep-pile carpet and what feels like rough forest floor as we travel through <em>Viola’s Room</em>, an immersive experience created by London’s Punchdrunk collective, which recently wrapped up a five-month run at Manhattan’s arts complex The Shed. We are a group of six. We walk through corridors accompanied by the gloriously round vowels of actor Helena Bonham Carter, who speaks into each of our noise-canceling headphones. Her voice tells an odd fairy tale. We enter and exit a series of rooms. Beautiful rooms . . . empty rooms. This “immersive theater” experience features no actors at all.</p><p>If you’re familiar with Punchdrunk’s previous work <em>Sleep No More</em> you know the basic vibe — the painstaking art direction is the point. But unlike that hit show, where audience members wearing masks are free to wander around a Hitchcockian hotel, this piece is unicursal, like a classic labyrinth — there is only one path. In <em>Sleep No More</em>, you observe and follow dancers from behind the protection of your face covering. In <em>Viola’s Room</em> there are no humans to spy on. Instead, you find yourself moving through a charming sort of music-box machinery. Lovely shadow dioramas light up as you pass. The operating principle is much like that of a haunted house, or “It’s A Small World” at Disneyland. This is a single-file ride, guided by the voice in your ears and faint lights that indicate the way.</p><p>There is much here to enchant: an eerily nostalgic 1990s teenager’s bedroom with a Soundgarden soundtrack, beautiful antique-feeling parlors that feel recently abandoned, gentle cold winds and earthen smells that swirl around gnarled trees. Fabric-draped walls press claustrophobically on your arms and shoulders as you squeeze through. The textured carpet on your bare feet has a way of bringing back childhood — I’d never thought of a shag rug as a Proustian <em>aide memoire</em>. But it worked. And for $70, I had a full sentimental and sensory experience. I left feeling satisfied, but also that I had been inside a dream. Which is to say, alone.</p><p>I’m a theater director, and I can own up to the fact that actors, including many of my friends, are a little bit much. A little embarrassing. They feel things . . . </p>...</source>
