        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to me.</em></p><h3>5,800 confidential files from o9</h3><p>A federal lawsuit filed in Texas accuses SAP and three former o9 Solutions executives of orchestrating one of the largest trade secret thefts in enterprise software history. The complaint identifies the sender as Sean Zonneveld, then a senior vice president at o9 Solutions, a Dallas-based artificial intelligence company. The lawsuit alleges the recipient was Zonneveld’s personal email account. Over the following months, the complaint claims, Zonneveld allegedly downloaded more than 5,800 confidential files before departing to join SAP.

China’s embrace of AI carries risks, and in areas such as frontier AI tech and chips, it lags the U.S. Still, China installed 295,000 industrial robots last year, nearly nine times as many as the U.S. The port of Tianjin teamed up with tech giant Huawei to launch a fleet of unmanned trucks and a system that optimizes tens of millions of variables and constraints, such as ship arrival times and crane capacity, to manage scheduling. Planning that used to take 24 hours now takes 10 minutes, Huawei says.

GE Appliances, owned by China’s Haier Smart Home, said the suppliers are located across 10 states, including four in Kentucky, four in Tennessee, and three in Indiana. The investment adds to the company’s plan announced earlier this year to spend $3 billion over the next five years to expand and modernize its U.S. factories, including a $490 million expansion of the Louisville washing-machine factory.
