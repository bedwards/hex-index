Today, I want to talk about sunk cost not as just an economic term from textbooks, but as a real force shaping our lives, our homes, our careers, and the way civilization reacts to the Great Simplification.</p><h2><strong>What Is Sunk Cost?</strong></h2><p>By definition, sunk cost is any past expense – time, money, effort – that cannot be recovered. If we were totally rational as people, or as a species, logic would tell us that sunk costs should be ignored. We cannot regain any of what we’ve lost by continuing to spend <em>more</em> on that same thing. At the same time, continuing forward with the same past actions will only hurt us and make it harder to change course in the future.</p><p>Instead, if we were truly logical, we should make decisions based only on our present situations, circumstances, and expected future payoffs. Of course, this is easier said than done because humans have memories, emotions, and social status – all things that we’ve tied our sense of identity to. We protect past investments as if they were living things, as if they were literally <em>us</em>.</p><p>Sunk cost shows up in small ways all the time in our society: that previously mentioned bad movie we sit through, a huge meal we keep eating even though we’re full, or an expensive jacket we wear that’s a size too big. We might chuckle a bit at these examples because they’re familiar, and they seem pretty trivial in the grand scheme of things. But, if you apply this same economic logic to careers, romantic partners, home mortgages, or national infrastructure…the stakes become quite high.</p><p>When it comes to the human predicament, where (in the not-too-distant future) we will need to completely change the way society works, this sunk cost psychological phenomenon </p>...</source>
