        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s core message about asking &#039;stupid&#039; questions and admitting ignorance directly echoes Socrates&#039; philosophical approach of questioning to expose gaps in knowledge. The Socratic method formalizes exactly what the author discovered independently.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Carol Dweck&#039;s research on growth vs fixed mindset provides the psychological foundation for why embracing &#039;feeling stupid&#039; accelerates learning - the article&#039;s thesis is essentially an application of growth mindset principles to technical education.</p>

        <p>One of the most common questions I get is <em>“how can I start learning _____?”</em>, where _____ is either mathematics, machine learning, or some other technical discipline.</p><p>You usually expect me to drop a hot tip that’ll make you an expert overnight, but unfortunately, I don’t have one. All I can give you is what I learned on my journey.</p><p>Whenever I decide to collect my thoughts, reflect on my experiences, and identify the patterns that emerged, I always end up at one core concept.</p><p>I can recall the exact moment my learning journey kickstarted. It was when I embraced that I knew nothing, and it’s perfectly alright.</p><p>In this post, we are going to talk about <em>humility</em>, that is, <em>“the willingness to look stupid.” </em></p><div><hr></div><p>I vividly remember my first semester as a young student of mathematics. <em>“Let F be an arbitrary field. V is called a vector space over F if…”</em> was the very first sentence I heard in my very first class, and it felt like a kick in the head, and I left the lecture feeling entirely confused about what vectors are.</p><p>The next memory: I’m sitting on the bed of my flat, staring at the lecture notes for hours, unable to comprehend a single thing.</p><p>My beginnings in math felt more like a futile wrestle with the Rosetta Stone, rather than unlocking the secrets of the universe.</p><p><em>“Let F be an arbitrary field.”</em> In our class of around a hundred first-year students, no one asked WTF a field is. About 10% of them knew, but the rest were just keeping up appearances, afraid of feeling or looking stupid.</p><p>I quickly realized that if I want to become a mathematician (and that’s the only thing I ever wanted to be), I have to overcome the resistance.</p><p>Appeasing peers and professors is useless. Appearances are irrelevant. Feeding our ego is dangerous.</p><p>Knowledge and skill matter.</p><p>So, I started asking all the stupid, trivial questions.</p><p><em>“What is that ∑ symbol?”</em> (It’s the summation sign.)</p><p><em>“Isn’t a vector just an arrow, pointing from the origin to a single point?”</em> (No, it’s not, but it’s a good mental model in the beginning.)</p><p><em>“Isn’t a field just like the set of real numbers?”</em> (Yes, it is. The set of real numbers is a good mental model of fields.)</p><p>I found that the best way to flatten the learning curve of ...</p>
