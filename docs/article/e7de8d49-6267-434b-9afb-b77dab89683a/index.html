      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>     Tomorrow will mark 20 years since the terrorist attacks on our nation on September 11, 2001. I have written recently concerning my personal experience on that day, so I will not attempt to do that again here. I simply want to say that what should have been a time of thankfulness for God’s gracious protection over us since those terrible events, has, instead, turned to another time of grief and pain due to the recent decisions of this present administration and the debacle that took place in Afghanistan. Instead of reaping the harvest of peace and freedom for us and the world, now we have sown seeds of discourse and animosity that will no doubt reap the fruits of those seeds. This is an incredible lesson for us to learn as believers when examining this situation, as well as others that have happened lately, because this is the reality of life in a fallen world. </p><p>     The Apostle Paul makes it clear in Galatians 6:7-9 the significance of sowing and reaping only what is good and eternal.</p><blockquote><p>                    <em>“Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, </em></p><p><em>                      that will he also reap. For the one who sows to his own flesh will</em></p><p><em>                      from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit</em></p><p><em>                      will from the Spirit reap eternal life. And let us not grow weary of </em></p><p><em>                      doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Add this to the warning given by the Old Testament prophet Hosea, “For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.” (Hosea 8:7a) And the instruction from God for the believer is made clear, <strong>be careful what you sow, because there will come a time of reaping.</strong> </p><p>     This is why the events that have transpired in recent weeks and months are so important for Christians to take note of, because inevitably the consequences of the decisions will bear fruit. Sure, the actions of the president in regard to Afghanistan led to the loss of military life and human life, but what will the long-term affects of that decision also lead to? The rise of ISIS in the region? Empowering our enemies? More war? Less peace? Undoubtedly the fruit of what has been sown, will not lead to reaping good things. </p><p>     Similarly, take the actions of our government in response to the law passed ...</p>
