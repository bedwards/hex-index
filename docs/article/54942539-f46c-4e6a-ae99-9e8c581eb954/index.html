But our personalities make us distinctly different. Psychologists and neuroscientists don’t agree exactly on what <em>determines </em>our personality. Some think of personality from a <em>trait </em>perspective with different spectrums (i.e., introversion, extraversion) that define personalities. Others think of personality from a social cognitive perspective believing that our personality forms by observing others and learning what to incorporate into own personality. </p><p>Regardless of what exactly <em>determines </em>our personality, it is interesting to wonder if our personalities can <strong>effect our health. </strong></p><p>This week, I want to share with you the results of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2752387">a recent study</a> which looked at how our personalities in adolescence could affect our risk for dementia <strong>five decades later. </strong>Dementia is a cognitive disorder that itself causes personality changes so it can be difficult to disentangle whether one’s personality is increasing one’s risk for dementia <strong>or </strong>if dementia is causing changes in personality. </p><p>This particular study gets around this problem by utilizing the Project Talent survey that was given to a random sample of 5% of all the high schools in the US in 1960. It’s extremely unlikely that any kind of dementia-related cognitive decline is occurring in adolescence, so the researchers claim they can be more confident that the causal chain isn’t going in the wrong direction. </p><h1>Calm, Vigor, and Maturity was associated with lower risk of dementia 5 decades later</h1><p>Some ~350,000 students completed a personality questionnaire and the researchers were able to enroll and track the health outcomes of ~82,000 people 54 years later using a Medicare database. <strong>Interestingly, they found that students who had high scores in Vigor, Calm, and Maturity were less likely to develop dementia over their lifetime. </strong>Vigor, in this sense, is a kind of sense of vitality, high levels of energy, and an active lifestyle. The study found that high scores of Vigor lowered dementia risk by 7%. </p><p>Students in the study who had low scores of neuroticism (or high scores of “calm”) overall had a healthier response to stress. Chronic stress is a causal factor in many diseases, so it’s not surprising to see a calm personality lower dementia risk. </p><h1>How could personality lead to dementia?</h1><p>Although this study is interesting to me, an obvious question for me is how </p>...</source>
