The right-wing activist murdered last week built his massive platform for <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1938631309930496221">racism</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-tells-taylor-swift-submit-your-husband-and-have-ton-children">sexism</a>, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-uses-slur-refer-transgender-tiktok-influencer">transphobia</a> and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-likens-concern-about-climate-change-pseudo-paganism">climate denial</a> in part by using anonymous funding from Big Oil.</p><p>Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded to ignite a culture war on college campuses, has managed to hide much of its funding sources. Roughly half of the group’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/800835023">$40 million in income</a> in 2020 came from 10 anonymous donors, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/turning-point-usa-donations-surged-pandemic-rcna37143">NBC News reported</a>. </p><p>But in 2017, Kirk admitted that some of the group’s anonymous donors “are in the fossil fuel space.” Speaking to <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity">The New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-conservative-nonprofit-that-seeks-to-transform-college-campuses-faces-allegations-of-racial-bias-and-illegal-campaign-activity">’s Jane Mayer</a>, Kirk disclosed that he’d fundraised for TPUSA at the annual meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), as well as the 2017 board meeting of the National Mining Association. </p><p>In those meetings, Kirk promised oil and gas companies he’d fight “the myth that fossil fuels are dirty,” and target the “leftist professors” on college campuses who “perpetuated” the “myth.” </p><p>The meetings “went great,” Kirk told Mayer. The IPAA’s president, Barry Russell, wound up <a href="https://archive.is/pQj6D">joining TPUSA’s advisory council</a>, where he remains today. (Kirk had said that most advisory council members are also TPUSA donors). </p><h3>How Kirk tried to re-popularize climate denial</h3><p>Over the next nine years, Kirk worked to chip away at <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/younger-americans-are-growing-more-worried-about-global-warming/">young Americans’ rising concerns about climate change</a>. He did this by claiming climate science is still debated—and then peddling the conspiracy theory that all climate policies are a Democratic bid for government control.</p><p>“A tyrant’s fantasy is to have a massive green economy transition,” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/4009494">he said in 2023</a>. “You can get rid of private property, you can control people’s movements. It’s fundamentally the abolition of civilization as we know it.” </p><p>To justify his claim that climate science is unsettled, Kirk would often cite “experts” who downplay the seriousness of planetary heating. For example, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/809191097507305">in 2023</a>, Kirk claimed climate science is “debated” because “a Nobel prize winning scientist recently came out and said there is no real climate crisis.” Kirk also <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/886665137322512384?lang=en">cited the opinions of John Coleman</a>, the now-deceased founder of the Weather </p>...</source>
