These are all books that I finished reading in 2024 in either paper or audio format. As in most years, I read more fiction than nonfiction, more women than men. Since this post is bound to be criminally long, I’m dividing it into two parts: </p><ol><li><p>Fiction </p></li><li><p>Nonfiction, Memoir and Poetry/Other. </p></li></ol><p>You can find my previous book lists <a href="https://www.sarahormanwrites.com/blog">here</a> or click <a href="https://sarahorman.substack.com/p/the-tyranny-of-the-year-end-list">here</a> to read why I’m ambivalent about the whole enterprise of making these end-of-year lists.</p><p>Without further ado, on to the list!</p><h2><strong>Fiction</strong></h2><p>I read 35 novels this year. To make the list less unwieldy I’ve divided them into the following categories:</p><ul><li><p>Novels that deal with marriage and motherhood</p></li><li><p>Mystery! (Unintentionally, I read more crime and mystery than usual.)</p></li><li><p>New novels by familiar favorites, e.g. Elizabeth Strout</p></li><li><p>New-to-me authors, including two brilliant Sarahs (Perry and Moss)</p></li><li><p>Exciting debuts</p></li><li><p>Books that made me think</p></li><li><p>Most recommended books – a handful of titles that I think a lot of readers will like</p></li></ul><h3>Marriage and motherhood</h3><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/all-fours-miranda-july/20578438?ean=9780593190265">All Fours</a></em> by Miranda July. In a post called <a href="https://sarahorman.substack.com/p/menopause-lit">Menopause Lit</a> in September, I wrote that I was having an unprecedented number of conversations about this book. Months later, I can report that people still want to talk about this book! Just now, my dad came over to watch football with my husband and son. He is listening to <em>All Fours</em> and finding it laugh-out-loud funny. I am delighted by the men in my life who are enjoying this novel, and the conversations it has sparked about midlife female desire. </p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/sandwich-catherine-newman/20960889?ean=9780063345164">Sandwich</a> </em>by Catherine Newman. This novel about a middle-aged woman on vacation with her family did not delight me as much as <em>All Fours, </em>but I’m intrigued and gratified to have read several novels this year in which characters are dealing with trauma from pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and childbirth. Much of the humor in <em>Sandwich </em>felt trite, but the narrator’s emotional arc has stuck with me.</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/reproduction/18859358?ean=9780063283626">Reproduction</a></em> by Louisa Hall is a slim novel that reads like memoir or autofiction. Ostensibly, the plot is about a woman who is writing a book about Mary Shelley while trying to become a mother. But that description doesn’t convey the book’s depth. This is stunning, wise, essential reading for anyone who has given serious consideration to fertility, creativity, and motherhood in the </p></li></ul>...</source>
