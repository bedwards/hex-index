        <p><em>(I decided to share some short stories I wrote in my youth. Or, like, at least this one.)</em></p><p>A man impales a cork on a metal skewer, holds it in the fire. Flames lick the metal, sooting it, blackening the cork. When the cork has cooled, he rubs it on his face, his hands, the shiny parts of his rifle, the medals on his uniform. He seems particularly disgruntled about having to soil his medals that way, and his rifle, which shone before as brightly as a newly minted penny that has never changed hands.</p><p>I had things somewhat easier. My rifle was an old, scavenged model, made from wood and pig iron, that only shone when wet.

He appeared to have sat in some chalk dust, or dry clay, before going over the top, for the seat of his trousers was dusted white. I tried to think of where in the trenches the clay could possibly be dry. I followed his bright buttocks winking in the dim starlight as we crawled. We were a good thousand yards from the Corolonian trenches. I saw the white buttocks in front of me disappear suddenly; there was a splash, and some cursing. “Mind the crater,” the officer called, but I had already crept closer to ...</p>
