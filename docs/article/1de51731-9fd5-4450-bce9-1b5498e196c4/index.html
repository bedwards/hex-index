        <p>Bright yellow cards. No annual fees. A smooth digital app that promised simplicity in a country where banking is often intimidating.<br>The mission was clear: bring lower-income Brazilians — especially those in the C and D income brackets — into the formal financial system.</p><p>And it worked. Millions joined. For many, that little yellow card was their first credit product. A symbol of trust and access.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Will Bank was expanding fast. The fintech, backed by Banco Master, built a portfolio heavy on consumers with thin or no credit history. Every swipe, every installment plan, every late payment carried weight on its balance sheet.</p><p>Then the numbers started to tell another story.</p><p>According to <em>Valor Econômico</em>, Will Bank now lists <strong>R$ 5.1 billion (roughly US $900 million to US $1 billion)  in receivables from payment transactions</strong>, a figure that caught the attention of Brazil’s financial press and regulators. It wasn’t just the amount. </p><blockquote><p>It was the question behind it: who owns the risk tied to those receivables?</p><p>Was it the issuer — Will Bank itself?<br>The acquirers handling card payments?<br>Or the merchants and fintech partners downstream?</p></blockquote><p>The lines weren’t clear. And that lack of clarity has reignited a debate that goes beyond one digital bank.</p><p>Brazil’s card ecosystem has long thrived on inclusion and innovation but much of it rests on complex partnerships and funding arrangements. When defaults rise or liquidity tightens, everyone feels the strain.</p><p>The Will Bank case has become a real-time stress test for how well the country’s financial inclusion model can hold up when credit risk scales faster than the safeguards around it.</p><h3>The cost of inclusion</h3><p>Financial inclusion is often celebrated as progress. More people in the system. More access.<br>But inclusion built on credit can easily become debt with a nicer interface.</p><p>This is something Emmanuel Daniel warned about in our <em>Emerging Markets Today</em> episode, <em><a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/financial-inclusion-the-good-the-bad-and-the-controversial/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Financial Inclusion: The Good, The Bad, and The Controversial</a></em>.</p><p>He argued that when fintechs onboard the unbanked into venture-capital-driven models, they aren’t empowering users.<br>True inclusion, he said, happens when financial systems are built from the ground up — as Grameen Bank once did in Bangladesh — keeping both assets and liabilities local. Emmanuel added:</p><blockquote><p>“For so long as we think of financial services as something that needs to be put on platforms and monetized, the whole idea of financial inclusion is a </p>...</blockquote>
