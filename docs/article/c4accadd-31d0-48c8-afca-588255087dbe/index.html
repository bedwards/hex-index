        <p><em>Today’s guest contributor brings a fascinating analysis of young online leftists in China, focussing on their ideology, social and political context, and how a Feng Xiaogang film inspired them to romanticize the Cultural Revolution.</em></p><p><em>Shijie Wang is an open-source researcher and Deputy Editor at The Jamestown Foundation’s </em>China Brief<em>. He completed a Master’s in Public Policy at Georgetown University. His research focuses on China’s domestic issues, foreign operations, and critical minerals; he also analyzes China’s strategic moves in the minerals sector through his <a href="https://substack.com/@sjwang1106?">personal Substack</a>.</em></p><h2>The “Fanghua” Incident</h2><p>In November 2025, a content creator named “<em>Liao Hui Dian Ying Ba</em>” (Let’s Chat Movies, 聊会电影吧) on Bilibili, China’s largest video-sharing platform, uploaded the first installment of his analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Xiaogang">Feng Xiaogang’s</a> (冯小刚) film <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6654316/">Fanghua</a></em> (<em>Youth, </em>芳华). Released in 2017, <em>Fanghua</em> follows the lives of several young members of a military performance troupe in southwestern China from the 1970s to the 1990s. The film places them against a backdrop of turbulent historical transitions: from the tail end of the Cultural Revolution and the Sino-Vietnamese War to the rise of Shenzhen during the Reform and Opening-up era, depicting the divergent fates of its characters. At the time of its release, the film was a box-office success, launched the careers of several young actors, and earned a respectable 7.7/10 rating on Douban Movie, China’s IMDB. However, once it left theaters, the film largely faded from public discourse — until this creator’s analysis surfaced.</p><p>Subsequently, the creator uploaded a second analysis video. In his commentary, he frequently referenced other critically acclaimed Chinese cultural products, such as <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6424870/">Ming Dynasty 1566</a> (</em>大明王朝1566<em>)</em>, <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1533117/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_Let%2520the%2520bull">Let the Bullets Fly</a> (</em>让子弹飞<em>)</em>, and <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111786/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_1_nm_7_in_0_q_In%2520the%2520Heat%2520of%2520the%2520Sun">In the Heat of the Sun</a> (</em>阳光灿烂的日子<em>)</em>. By cryptically hinting at the film’s hidden political metaphors, he quickly attracted a massive audience of young viewers. They showered the video with likes, reposts, and “coins” (投币) — a Bilibili feature that allows users to tip or donate to content creators as a sign of endorsement.</p><p>The climax of this saga occurred on November 29, when “Liao Hui Dian Ying Ba” uploaded his third analysis of <em>Fanghua</em>. Perhaps frustrated by persistent questions in his private messages, he began the video by declaring that he would no longer hide behind euphemisms; instead, he would explicitly reveal the film’s “true” political agenda. In doing so, he completely overturned ...</p>
