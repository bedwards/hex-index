        <p>Hi All,</p><p>If history does not exactly repeat itself (and it does not) then it does often rhyme. What we are seeing from the Trump administration is unprecedented in its betrayal of Ukraine. The US is now acting like an agent of Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship in bullying democratic Ukraine to surrender parts of it territory, a wealth of natural resources and millions of its people to Putin’s brutal rule. The USA is not negotiating between Ukraine and Russia, it is putting enormous pressure on Ukraine to agree to a deal that <em>might</em> appeal to Putin. This is what I mean when I say that the US is now the enemy of freedom. It wants to strengthen dictatorships at the expense of democracies.</p><p>However there are some interesting historical comparisons that people are making—the rhymes as it were. The one most commonly thrown around in US history is Franklin Roosevelt at Yalta. In this case the US supposedly accepted the expansion of brutal totalitarian rule over countries that wished to be their allies. Aha, we are told, Trump is nothing new. The USA has in the past sold out possible allies into dictatorial rule.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png" width="750" height="606" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:606,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Stalin &amp; Roosevelt at Yalta, 1945&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Stalin &amp; Roosevelt at Yalta, 1945" title="Stalin &amp; Roosevelt at Yalta, 1945" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OSnK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ab27ac-ad3e-4e17-a03b-9957f85e2469_750x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta. This was a fundamentally different situation than the one we are seeing between Trump and Putin.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Btw, before Donald Trump took over the Republican Party, you could reliably expect to hear any Democratic attempt to reach a compromise deal <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/the-yalta-conference-at-seventy-five-lessons-from-history/">described by Republicans as a potential sell-out </a>of the type Franklin Roosevelt supposedly did at the Yalta Conference (February 4-11, 1945). Ronald Reagan, for example, was a constant critic of Roosevelt’s actions at Yalta, with examples ranging from the 1950s <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/statement-40th-anniversary-yalta-conference">through his two terms in office</a>. </p><p>The widely shared Republican critique was that the Roosevelt too easily trusted Stalin, deferred to the USSR and as a result <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/02/05/President-Reagan-said-Tuesday-he-would-like-to-erase/3967476427600/">consigned half of Europe to totalitarian rule for generations</a>. </p><p>So it is rather bitterly ironic today that it is the GOP, after decades of attacking FDR for “betraying” Poland, that is using all of America’s might to betray and weaken a democratic Ukraine. That being said, what Trump is doing is far far worse than anything FDR was accused of. To understand just how large the differences are, I will start with a short primer on Yalta and FDR.</p><p><strong>Roosevelt and Yalta</strong></p><p>What happened factually at Yalta is actually not an area of disagreement. </p>...</source>
