        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references &#039;Elliot Smith&#039;s Alphabet Town&#039; - Elliott Smith was a critically acclaimed singer-songwriter from Portland who wrote about the city&#039;s neighborhoods. His life story, music career, and tragic death provide rich context for understanding the Portland artistic scene the author is nostalgic about.</p>

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses how private equity has destroyed beloved publications like Deadspin, Vice News, and the Denver Post. Understanding the mechanics of PE firms, their fee structures, and business models illuminates the economic forces the author argues are homogenizing media and neighborhoods alike.</p>

          <span class="read-time">16 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central metaphor compares the transformation of Portland&#039;s NW neighborhood (now &#039;The Pearl&#039;) to the homogenization of the internet. Understanding gentrification&#039;s history, mechanisms, and debates provides academic context for the author&#039;s observations about displaced artists and vanishing character.</p>

You’d order, and two middle-aged Greek men would get to work building the best sandwich you’d ever had—a title lasting only until your next one—while also yelling over their shoulder at you for reading the magazines. It was always open right when you needed it, and the food was priced to move. In other words, perfect for the starving-artist crowd or broke teenagers. Dealer’s choice. </p><p>This was one part of a rich tapestry that made the neighborhood what it was—quirky, eclectic, and just sketchy enough to be interesting. The streets are named alphabetically. I think most readers know Elliot Smith’s<a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/alphabet-town/313345408?i=313345683"> Alphabet Town</a>. This is that place. They’re here, and it was one more part of what made the place cool. You could find good food, good bars, and good buys. And none of them ever appeared in a tourist guide. The most mainstream thing going was an Arby’s that I’m still half convinced was a front. Otherwise, it was all names you’d never heard of, but if said around PDX’ers of a certain age, would light their eyes up. Places like Quality Pie—which I can somehow still smell—Foothill Broiler, and Elephant Delicatessen. The latter two were for the waking hours. The rest lived on the back side of the block.</p><p>Even if you <s>didn’t have the munchies</s> weren’t hungry, there was plenty to see. This was, of course, before the age of the cellphone, but you didn’t need one; you could just walk around and notice cool things. Something interesting might happen, or it might not. Didn’t matter. The environment was so engaging, the vibe so electric, that it created its own kind of dopamine rush. You felt like a part of the place and were immersed in it. It was being present before lifestyle coaches convinced you that you needed that in your life.</p><p>And then the VC money came.</p><p>I recently saw a quote<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> that said something to the effect of <em>“When a Starbucks moves in, it’s good news for property values, and bad news for the tattoo artists.”</em> And boy, is that ever true. As the values rise, the edges get sanded off. The homogeneity creeps in. A feeling of sameness starts to bloom. Things look nice, but it’s a Potemkin village </p>...</source>
