Some, even spreading fake news that she claimed she’s DEFINITELY running. </p><p>But what’s even more maddening is the stream of people on multiple social media platforms (some who don’t even live in Texas) are pushing narratives that James Talarico and Colin Allred should either drop out of the race, or switch races. See, ever since <a href="https://www.tpr.org/news/2025-11-17/joaquin-castro-on-why-a-democratic-senate-logjam-stopped-him-from-running-for-ag">Joaquin Castro talked about all the heavy-hitters running as a slate</a> at TribFest, I think some Democrats have got it in their mind that’s still a possibility. </p><p>After something like the 20th post of someone saying, “Talarico should just drop out and support Jasmine,” I lost it. </p><p><em>Further reading: <a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/its-election-season-so-suddenly-everyone">It’s Election Season, So Suddenly Everyone Is A F*cking Expert In Texas Politics</a></em></p><p>I told the person, who I later found out was  very friendly, that Talarico has already hit record-breaking numbers. His polling numbers show he can win the Senate race. And why should he drop out because you like Crockett better? I may have finished it with “This isn’t fantasy football, honey.”</p><p>Yes, it was condescending. Yes, I was called out for being condescending. And I apologized, because I wasn’t trying to be an asshole, but I was frustrated with the premise that Talarico should drop or change races for Jasmine Crockett because of her celebrity, when she’s not guaranteed to win the general election. (I’ll get there.)</p><p>We have a lot we need to talk about. And I’m going to put a lot on the table, and some of this is going to be <em>very</em> inside baseball. But my dear, sweet Texas Democrats, there just isn’t enough nuance in politics, and I really hope this brings more.</p><h4>First and foremost: Polling.</h4><p>Why does everyone and their mothers and cousins want to get in the Senate race? Because every single one of them has internal polling that shows they can win. Every single one. Allred’s polling shows that he can win. Talarico’s shows he can win. Crockett, the same. Even Beto and Castro had polling done on that race that showed they would win if they jumped in, too. </p><p>Does polling automatically mean they will win? Not necessarily, but it’s an indicator. </p>...</source>
