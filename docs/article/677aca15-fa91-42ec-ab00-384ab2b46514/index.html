But I need to write about being depressed. And for me those experiences cannot be neatly cleft, like conjoined twins whose shared skin shelters so much blood.</p><p>I once worked as a kid actor and kept at it until I was 23. I felt burnt out, lost, and useless. I filled my days with reading, using my newfound time to try to brute-force my way through a classical education. Then I read a charming essay by Salvatore Scibona about St. John’s, a small liberal arts college in New Mexico focused on reading and discussing great books. My wife and I visited classes and I felt at home, so we left Los Angeles and I started studying. The money I saved from five years of regular work on television was quickly immolated by tuition. After graduating, I didn’t feel my niche resume qualified me to work any job — but, as liberal arts graduates know, there is always teaching. And the state of New Mexico desperately needed teachers. After a few months of classes, I got my license and a job teaching English language arts to high schoolers at a charter school focused on “expeditionary learning” (that is, going outside). I went in with big plans and ideals, high on theories of pedagogy, believing my classroom would be an oasis of respect in a desert of inhumanity. I knew on paper that I could burn out and knew that many teachers quickly did. But I took the job anyway because I needed the money, respected the work, and would be working with adults willing to pretend again that I knew what I was doing.</p><p>In most American schools, new teachers aren’t provided much help. I was given a rough description of what my predecessor did, an outline of state standards, three days of training, and a lanyard. The school had lost its lease on its prior campus and now rented out half a megachurch on the south side of town. The workday’s basic structure was this: Wake at 5:45 a.m., carpool with another teacher at 6:30 a.m., teach class for six and a half hours — punctuated by a short lunch break and hour-long prep period — then carpool home and grade assignments.
