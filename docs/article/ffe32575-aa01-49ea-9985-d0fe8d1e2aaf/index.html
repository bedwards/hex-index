(I talked about that on the Fordham podcast this week, too.) I offered three suggestions:</p><ol><li><p>Call it “advanced education” instead of gifted education.</p></li><li><p>Address concerns around equity and bias by using “universal screening” to identify eligible students instead of parent or teacher recommendations.</p></li><li><p>Build initiatives in every elementary school in the country—including high-poverty ones—to serve their top 10 percent of students, at least.</p></li></ol><p>I solicited ideas on what else we might do to get progressives to embrace advanced education in the early grades, just like they support expanding access to advanced courses in middle school and high school. And boy did y’all deliver!</p><p>Let’s group the suggestions into four buckets:</p><ul><li><p>Rhetoric.</p></li><li><p>Nomenclature.</p></li><li><p>Program design.</p></li><li><p>Political strategy.</p></li></ul><p>In terms of <strong>rhetoric</strong>, several of you had recommendations for arguments that might be persuasive to folks on the left, especially around equity and fairness.</p><h4><strong>Equity</strong></h4><p>An <strong>anonymous</strong> contributor writes:</p><blockquote><p>The concern from “the left” has always been about equity. Underneath are several smaller concerns related to resource allocation (e.g., why give more to kids who already have a lot? this takes away resources and time from kids who need more help, it’s just a way to keep rich (mostly) White people happy and in the district), plus the argument that gifted ed is just segregation of schools by another name.</p><p>The strongest argument from a “left” perspective for advanced learning in public schools is that less-advantaged kids are the ones that need it most. American schools could get rid of all honors courses, AP, etc. tomorrow and it would make very little difference in the life of a rich kid. Her parents would open-enroll her to a different district, go to a private school, lobby/run for school board and change the policy, or get private tutoring.
