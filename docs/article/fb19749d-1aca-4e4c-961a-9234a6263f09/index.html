        <p>From the Pastor:</p><p><strong>Psalm 14:1</strong></p><p>The fool has said in his heart,</p><p>“There is no God.”</p><p>They are corrupt,</p><p>They have done abominable works,</p><p>There is none who does good.</p><p>Last week I spent a good portion of my time considering the Truth of God’s Word. Bro. Joseph asked me to lead the Wednesday night Student and Parent Bible Study and my topic for that evening was “the Belt of Truth.” That’s what prompted my study, and that topic has been on my mind since.

He or she may have all the worldly intelligence one can possess, but in their folly they do not see the immorality that they are living in. That is why David says that for all practical reason the fool has denied, rejected, and abandoned the concept of a living God. This is what the fool has done whether intentionally or not.
