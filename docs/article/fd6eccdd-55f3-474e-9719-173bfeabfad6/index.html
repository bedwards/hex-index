        <h3>“Our task at midlife is to be strong enough to relinquish the ego-urgencies of the first half and open ourselves to a greater wonder.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>“In the middle of the journey of our life I found myself within a dark woods where the straight way was lost,” Dante wrote in the <em>Inferno</em>. “The perilous time for the most highly gifted is not youth,” the visionary Elizabeth Peabody cautioned half a millennium later as she considered <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/07/05/elizabeth-peabody-figuring/">the art of self-renewal</a>, “the perilous season is middle age.” </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0919123600/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>The Middle Passage: From Misery to Meaning in Midlife</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/44961060" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>), Jungian analyst James Hollis offers a torch for turning the perilous darkness of the middle into a pyre of profound transformation — an opportunity, both beautiful and terrifying, to reimagine the patterns of thought, feeling, and behavior acquired in the course of adapting to life’s traumas and demands, and finally inhabit the authentic self beneath the costume of this provisional personality. </p>

<p>One has entered the Middle Passage when the demands of the true self press restive and uprising against the acquired persona, eventually colliding to produce untenable psychic ache — a “fearsome clash,” Hollis writes, leaving one “radically stunned into consciousness.” A generation after James Baldwin contemplated <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/06/06/james-baldwin-giovannis-room-love-choice/">how myriad chance events infuse our lives with the illusion of choice</a>, Hollis considers our unexamined conditioning as a root cause of this clash:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the first step in making the Middle Passage meaningful is to acknowledge the partiality of the lens we were given by family and culture, and through which we have made our choices and suffered their consequences. If we had been born of another time and place, to different parents who held different values, we would have had an entirely different lens. The lens we received generated a conditional life, which represents not who we are but how we were conditioned to see life and make choices… We succumb to the belief that the way we have grown to see the world is the only way to see it, the right way to see it, and we seldom suspect the conditioned nature of our perception.</p></blockquote>
<p>Haunting this conditional life are our psychic reflexes — the coping mechanisms developed for the traumas of childhood, which Hollis divides into two basic categories: “the experience of neglect or abandonment” ...</p>
