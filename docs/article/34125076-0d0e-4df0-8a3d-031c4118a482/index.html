Understanding this paramilitary organization that became the core of the IDF and its role in the 1948 founding of Israel provides crucial historical context for the Wexner family&#039;s deep ties to Israel.</p>

        <p>Our latest article on the life and times of Jeffrey Epstein is based on a cache of emails obtained by the whistleblower nonprofit Distributed Denial of Secrets, which provided access to them to Drop Site News. The cache includes the undisclosed names of Epstein victims as well as explicit images, meaning it can’t simply be published in whole without some redactions. But many of the messages <em>can</em> quickly be made public, and to that end Drop Site is collaborating with the team <a href="https://jmail.world/">that built Jmail</a> to make new emails available and searchable there, beginning this week, and rolling out continuously as we vet the remainder of the cache. (<a href="https://jmail.world/">Jmail is a searchable inbox of Epstein’s emails </a>that mimics Gmail.)</p><p>None of this work would be possible without our growing base of subscribers.

The Wexner Foundation is one of the largest contributors to pro-Israel causes in the U.S.</p><p>The review claimed that Wexner Foundation staff had “no contact” with Epstein after his resignation as a trustee in September 2007, and, before that, he had “played no role in the management or administration of the Foundation’s operations,” had “no meaningful role in the Foundation’s budget [or] finances,” and “did not make decisions regarding the use of Foundation’s funds.” None of that is true.</p><p>Hundreds of leaked emails from Epstein’s Yahoo inbox, </p>...</source>
