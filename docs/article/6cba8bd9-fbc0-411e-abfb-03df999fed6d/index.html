This will take place on Monday 1 December for the Americas and Europe (5pm EST / 11pm CET), and Tuesday 2 December for the Asia–Pacific (9am AEDT)</p><p>If you’re a <em>GD Professional</em> subscriber, you’ll have received the registration details separately.</p><p>If you’re not — and would like to attend — do consider upgrading so you can join us.</p><p>By way of background, Peter spent 35 years in Australia’s diplomatic and defence ministries, serving as Ambassador to Russia, Ambassador to Germany, Ambassador to Kazakhstan, Deputy Secretary of Defence, and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations. His grasp of Russian strategic culture is extraordinary. I can attest to this personally: he was my boss in Moscow from 2016 to 2019, when we both served in the Australian embassy. Few people can read the Kremlin as well as Peter.</p><p>We will also hold our regular monthly private roundtable for <em>GD Professional</em> subscribers, where our Chief Strategist Michael Feller will cover the five major geopolitical developments of the month — including the Ukraine war — and look ahead to what matters most for business. That session is on Tuesday, 2 December (4pm EST / 10am CET / 8pm AEDT).</p><p><strong>A potential inflection point</strong></p><p>Without attempting to forecast the outcome, it’s worth setting out the dynamics that have now come into view.</p><p>After months of back-channel diplomacy, several peace-framework proposals have surfaced: one reflecting US–Ukrainian preferences, another pushed by key Europeans, and a set of Russian counter-positions delivered in unusually detailed comments from Vladimir Putin. Much of Moscow’s line is familiar, but one element has been sharply elevated: the idea that President Zelensky must step aside — or be removed — before “serious negotiations” can begin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russia has increased military pressure with renewed strikes on Kyiv. Washington appears increasingly willing to press Kyiv toward an agreement that would have previously been off-limits. </p>...</source>
