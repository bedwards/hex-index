By 2025, Ukraine fields a diverse but still imperfect long-range strike arsenal, with lighter drones and mini-cruise missiles forming the backbone and new efforts underway to add heavier missile systems.</p><p>This post attempts to provide an initial assessment of the evolution of Ukraine’s missile industry and programs, from pre-2022 to today.</p><p><strong>2014–2022: Ukraine’s Pre-War Missile Industry</strong></p><p>On the eve of 2022, Ukraine retained a real but uneven missile capacity built on Soviet-era design and production hubs at Yuzhnoye and Yuzhmash, complemented by Luch for longer-range missile systems.</p><p>Concrete outputs existed but were limited in scale: the Vilkha guided 300 mm rocket entered service in 2018 with serial production beginning in 2019, and the R-360 Neptune coastal anti-ship cruise missile was <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/7989">delivered</a> to the Ukrainian Navy in March 2021, reportedly just achieving initial operational capability before the war. A short-range ballistic missile program, the Hrim-2 (with the export version known as Sapsan), remained mired in prolonged development with uncertain funding and timelines.</p><p>Structural constraints in Ukraine’s missile industry were significant. Deep <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2014/05/close-ranks">historical dependence</a> on Russian components and markets, sharply disrupted after 2014 and only partially substituted by 2022. Yet opportunities remained in a skilled workforce, legacy facilities, rising domestic demand after 2014, and early export interest, such as <a href="https://armyrecognition.com/archives/archives-naval-defense/naval-defense-2021/indonesia-negotiates-acquisition-of-ukrainian-rk-360mc-neptune-coastal-missile-defense-system">talks with Indonesia</a> on the Neptune in 2021.</p><p><strong>2022: Ukraine’s Missile Industry Under Fire</strong></p><p>The challenges Ukraine’s missile industry experienced deepened once the war began. Russia likely made a concerted effort in the early months to disrupt and destroy Ukraine’s missile industry, though details remain murky.</p><p>One confirmed case was a missile strike on the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-missile-strikes-target-ukrainian-gas-production-facilities-ukraines-pm-2022-11-17/">Pivdenmash</a> production plant in Dnipro in November 2022, which produced rocket motors and liquid fuel, among other components. There are also reports that infrastructure linked to the Hrim-2 program was targeted early on, in particular a solid-fuel production plant in Dnipro, causing a setback to the program.</p><p>Within the chaos of the war and intense competition among industry and services for scarce funds and resources, scaling Ukraine’s missile industry likely posed a major challenge. Ongoing programs such as the Hrim-2 were probably </p>...</source>
