        <p>We all seem to have an excuse.</p><p>I’m not talking about legitimate excuses like not being able to drive to work because your car broke down…</p><p>… And I’m not talking about the little day to day excuses like “I can’t clean my room today, I’m too tired.”</p><p>I’m talking about a different type of excuse.</p><p><strong>The one or two big excuses that hold you back.</strong></p><p>The stuff your mind tells you every day unconsciously that holds you back from being where you truly want to be.</p><p>The “invisible script” running in your head… day in and day out.</p><p>… And you probably don’t even realize this script is sabotaging you at every turn.</p><p>Some common ones are:</p><p><em>“I don’t have enough money…”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t have enough time…”</em></p><p><em>“I’m not good-looking enough. Strong enough. Tall enough. Fast enough. Smart enough…”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t have what it takes to do what HE or SHE did…”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t have enough resources…”</em></p><p><em>“That’s just not who I am…”</em></p><p><em>“I’m lazy. I’m messy. I’m too overwhelmed…”</em></p><p>These are the types of excuses that keep you frozen in your tracks.</p><p><strong>Then, there are 2 other types of excuses…</strong></p><ul><li><p>The justifying excuse.</p></li><li><p>The comforting excuse.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s the reality of our “invisible scripts”…</p><p>Every excuse we make has either a “justifying phrase” or a “comfort phrase” behind it.</p><p>The justifying phrases go like this…</p><p><em>“Why don’t you have enough money?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Well, I don’t have a four year degree… My parents were poor… I didn’t have opportunities because of the city I’m from.”</em></p><p>The comfort phrases go like this…</p><p><em>“I don’t NEED more money. I’m content with where I am…”</em></p><p><em>“I don’t NEED more love in my relationships. Things are good enough…”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>“I don’t NEED to be healthier. I’m healthier than most of my friends…”</em></p><p>Now, yes. There are times when you truly do have enough of something.&nbsp;</p><p>You <em>can</em> be fully content with what you have.</p><p>… But you need to be able to differentiate when it’s the truth — and when it’s just a way to stay in your comfort zone.</p><p>These phrases aren’t true.</p><p>When you believe them, you hold yourself back from your full potential.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re stealing your gift away from the world, and those who can benefit from your gift.</p><p>YOU decide what your life is like.</p><p>YOU are exactly where you are because that’s exactly where you’re supposed to be.</p><p>Your life is ...</p>
