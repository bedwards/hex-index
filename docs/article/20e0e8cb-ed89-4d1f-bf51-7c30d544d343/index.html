          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the craft of creating new words (neologisms) in fiction writing. Understanding the linguistic history and mechanisms of how neologisms form and enter languages would provide valuable context for readers interested in worldbuilding.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Miéville&#039;s novel Embassytown is the primary text discussed in the article. Learning about his broader body of work, literary influences, and the &#039;New Weird&#039; genre he helped define would enrich understanding of his linguistic experimentation.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Embassytown&#039;s central premise—that the Ariekei&#039;s Language shapes and limits their ability to think, lie, or imagine—directly engages with linguistic relativity (the idea that language structure affects cognition). This foundational concept in linguistics would provide deep context for the novel&#039;s themes.</p>
