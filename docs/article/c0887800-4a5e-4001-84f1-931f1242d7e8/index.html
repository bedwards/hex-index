        <p>“Super pollutants” – short-lived climate pollutants like methane (CH4) and some refrigerants (halocarbons) – are having a moment. There were numerous sessions on the topic during the recent New York Climate Week, and a number of companies are exploring investments in reducing these emissions as part of their climate goals.</p><p>Reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) is, by itself, an unambiguously good thing. Methane in particular is responsible for around a <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf">third of all warming to-date</a> from well-mixed greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and reductions in emissions can have a rapid cooling effect on the planet.</p><p>It is when methane (or other SLCPs) are used to offset or neutralize CO2 emissions – to make a claim that the climate effects of CO2 can be counterbalanced by methane – that the problem becomes much, much thornier. As Ray Pierrehumbert <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2023/12/mass-delusion-and-wishful-thinking-why-everything-you-think-you-know-about-methane-is-probably-wrong/">explains</a>, “It is useful to reduce methane, but it’s not going to really help us towards net zero. The only real solution to the climate crisis is to get carbon dioxide emissions down to as close to zero as we can.”</p><h3><strong>Stocks vs flows</strong></h3><p>The question of how to compare methane and CO2 is one that has long interested me. I wrote a paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421515300239">a decade ago</a> on how to compare the climate impacts of coal and natural gas (back when talk of a “natural gas bridge” was in vogue), and authored the chapter on methane and other short-lived climate pollutants for Greta Thunberg’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Book-Facts-Solutions/dp/0593492307">Climate Book</a>.</p><p>At its core, the difference in climate impacts between CO2 and methane comes down to the fact that CO2 is a “stock pollutant” and methane is a “flow pollutant”.</p><p>CO2 is an extremely stable molecule that accumulates in the atmosphere over time with constant emissions; while a portion of CO2 can be absorbed by land and ocean sinks in the form of organic or inorganic carbon, it does not naturally degrade. The warming that results from CO2 is – to a first order approximation – a largely time-invariant function of cumulative emissions. If CO2 emissions increase, the world warms faster; if they stay constant the world warms at a constant rate; if emissions decline, the world warms more slowly. But even if CO2 emissions get to zero, the world does not meaningfully cool back down for centuries to come; the only way to cool the planet through CO2 is to go net-negative – ...</p>
