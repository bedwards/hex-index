(Photo by <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?artistexact=Brandon%20Bell">Brandon Bell</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Housing systems across the United States are under pressure from multiple directions. Changes to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have left local providers scrambling to maintain programs, while cities are getting creative with existing laws and turning to zoning reforms, accessory dwelling units, and transit-oriented projects to boost supply. At the same time, rising home prices and worsening affordability are reshaping how Americans approach housing and homeownership.</p><div><hr></div><h4>States re-evaluate policies amid HUD changes </h4><p><strong>Disruptions to supportive housing across the U.S.<br></strong>HUD’s shift away from permanent supportive housing is causing upheaval across the country, with local agencies warning they may lose long-standing programs even as needs intensify. </p><p>In New England, providers cited by the <a href="http://Boston">Boston Globe</a> say the new funding rules for the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/hud-partners/community-coc">Continuum of Care program</a> could destabilize hundreds of residents who rely on long-term rental support. The rules cut support for permanent supportive housing in favor of transitional, work-or-treatment-required shelter models, prompting a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/25/metro/lawsuit-trump-hud-homeless-funding-ri/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results&amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link">multistate lawsuit</a> to block the cuts.</p><p>In Los Angeles, LAist reports that local officials estimate HUD’s new funding requirements could remove long-term rental support for <a href="https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/lahsa-funding-hud-trump-nofo-cuts-housing-first-shelter-permanent">roughly 5,000 people</a> currently housed in permanent supportive units. On top of that, plans to gut <a href="https://laist.com/brief/news/housing-homelessness/trump-administration-plans-mass-firing-at-office-that-funds-homelessness-programs">more than 80 percent</a> of the HUD staff who administer homelessness grants have left providers scrambling to redesign programs, renegotiate contracts, and brace for widespread displacement if the cuts take effect. </p><p>And in Michigan, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/11/29/hud-grant-funding-homeless/87449354007/">the Detroit Free Press reports</a> that agencies across the state may have to shut down supportive housing, rapid-rehousing, and shelter programs that thousands rely on to stay housed. With winter approaching and demand for services high, Michigan nonprofits say the abrupt shift away from permanent housing models leaves them scrambling to find replacement funding or prepare for rising homelessness as contracts expire.</p><p><strong>Supply, vacancy, and funding pressures for Portland’s low-income housing<br></strong>Portland’s subsidized housing system is showing strain from multiple angles. A recent study conducted by the real-estate analytics firm CoStar and reported by <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/12/nearly-1900-affordable-portland-apartments-sit-empty-while-thousands-need-homes.html">The Oregonian</a> found that nearly 1,900 subsidized apartments — about 7.4 percent of the city’s roughly 25,409 “affordable” units — are currently vacant. Housing providers cited by The Oregonian warn that even the subsidized rents remain too high for many low‑income households, potentially explaining why units sit empty even as demand remains high.</p><p>At the same time, Oregon Public Broadcasting <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2025/12/01/portland-oregon-home-forward-housing-rent/">reports</a> that the </p>...</source>
