        <p>Today marks the 50th anniversary of the dismissal of the Whitlam Government (Labor or progressive) in Australia. Does this event still matter amid the churning of the world in 2025?</p><p>On 11 November 1975 Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was sacked by the Governor General using the ‘reserve powers’ of the Constitution, reserved for the monarch’s representative. Yes, for non-antipodean readers, the Queen of England was still the Queen of Australia. In response, Whitlam defiantly stood on the steps of Parliament House and after the Governor-General’s secretary completed his formal proclamation with the salutation, “God Save the Queen,” Whitlam, the barrister, responded with the words, legendary in Australian political history,</p><blockquote><p>Well may you say ‘God save the Queen’ because nothing will save the Governor General.</p><p>Gough Whitlam, 11 November 1975</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png" width="1098" height="608" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:608,&quot;width&quot;:1098,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:927513,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jeffrich.substack.com/i/178562473?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8uSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b77f55e-a702-4f0a-b566-e7db93fa493b_1098x608.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">11 November 1975, Whitlam stands behind right shoulder of Governor-General’s Secretary announcing his dismissal</figcaption></figure></div></blockquote><p>A three-minute summary of these events with archival footage of this moment is below, especially for non-Australian readers.</p><div id="youtube2-opz97499flU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;opz97499flU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/opz97499flU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The history of Australia’s greatest constitutional crisis remains passionately debated, although after 50 years clear memories are clouded by political mythologies. Was it a coup arranged by the CIA or the Palace? Did it expose irredeemable flaws in Australian democracy? Who was to blame? Whose villainy was blackest? Has Australia ever since enjoyed full national sovereignty within the American alliance?</p><p>And why, despite Gough’s plea to the nation to “maintain the rage,” did the Australian electorate validate the decision by the despised Governor General, Sir John Kerr, his dismissal of the legendary reforming Labor Government, not once, but twice. In both the 1975 and 1977 elections Whitlam and the Labor Party were defeated in landslides. In 1975 the ALP lost 30 seats and suffered a 7.4 per cent swing in votes. New Liberal-National (conservative) Prime Minister Malcom Fraser enjoyed a 91 to 36 majority in the new Parliament. In 1977 the majority changed marginally to 86 to 38.</p><p>Democracy threw out another inconvenient truth.
