But there is a further difference: the spectacle is not intended for those the pair confront. After all, the Palestinians know only too well that they have been suffering for decades under the boot of a lawless, joint US-Israeli criminal enterprise.</p><p>No, the intended audience are the onlookers: western publics.</p><p><strong>Ban on aid groups</strong></p><p>The US “<a href="https://www.palestine-studies.org/en/node/163480">honest broker” myth</a> should have perished long ago. But somehow it persists, despite the evidence endlessly discrediting it. And that is because western capitals and western media keep propping the myth up, treating it as a plausible description of events it simply cannot explain.</p><p>Nothing has disrupted the official “policing” storyline in Gaza, supposedly against Hamas “law-breaking.”</p><p>It is now echoed in Trump’s outlandish claim that his self-declared oil grab in Venezuela is really about bringing Maduro to justice for supposed drug trafficking—or “narco-terrorism” as the administration prefers to call it.</p><p>Why has Gaza dropped off the front pages? Only because the “good cop” declares it has brought hostilities from the “bad cop” to an end.</p><p>Last </p>...</source>
