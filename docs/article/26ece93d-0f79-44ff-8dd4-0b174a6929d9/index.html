Tangopaso/wikimedia CC BY-SA 4.0.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A survey conducted by the Ifop polling firm for Bayard-La Croix <a href="https://www.la-croix.com/religion/qui-sont-les-catholiques-engages-en-france-notre-enquete-exclusive-20251207">concluded</a> that 50% of the country’s weekly Massgoers attend confession, also known as the Sacrament of Reconciliation.</p><p>The poll, whose results were published Dec. 8 by the Catholic daily newspaper La Croix, which is owned by Bayard Presse, also found that 36% of those who attend Mass at least once a month frequent the sacrament.</p><p>Among those who go to Mass less than once a month but are still engaged with the faith, 7% attend confession, compared with 12% among those who attend Mass mainly on special occasions.</p><p>La Croix <a href="https://www.la-croix.com/religion/le-retour-d-un-sens-du-peche-pourquoi-la-confession-revient-chez-les-catholiques-20251210">noted</a> that the survey did not state whether the figures were higher or lower than in previous years. But it said that anecdotal evidence suggested confession was “making a comeback” among French Catholics.</p><p>Canon Jean-Marc Pimpaneau, the pastor of the Church of Saint-Louis d’Antin in Paris, told the newspaper he was convinced more Catholics were attending confession.</p><p>“It’s in the air,” he said. “The return of traditional practices, prayer vigils, pilgrimages... and a certain awareness of sin.”</p><p>Priests hear confessions daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. at Saint-Louis d’Antin, which is located near the capital’s most popular department stores. At the church’s entrance are two banners proclaiming: “Priests welcome you for confession seven days a week.”</p><p>France’s bishops <a href="https://eglise.catholique.fr/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/Reperes-confesseurs.pdf">called</a> at a plenary meeting in November 2024 for the country’s dioceses to establish a body known as a <em>pénitencerie diocésaine</em>, or diocesan penitentiary, to provide training and support to priests who hear confessions. Pimpaneau <a href="https://dioceseparis.fr/la-penitence-ne-devrait-jamais.html">helped to establish</a> a <em>pénitencerie diocésaine</em> in the Archdiocese of Paris.</p><p>The results of the Ifop poll appear to challenge the widespread perception that confession is in terminal decline among Catholics in Western nations. </p><p>In the book “For I Have Sinned,” published in April 2025, author James O’Toole <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/books/9780674294523">noted</a> that the practice diminished dramatically in the U.S., beginning in the 1970s. Historian Guillaume Cuchet has <a href="https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2022/09/13/anatomist-of-the-catholic-collapse-in-france-and-beyond/">suggested</a> that a similarly sharp decline occurred in France from 1965 onward.</p><p>Attending confession at least once a year is one of the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/catechism/en/part_three/section_one/chapter_three/article_3/ii_the_precepts_of_the_church.html">five precepts</a> of the Church, a summary of Catholics’ essential obligations.</p><p>In recent years, the Catholic Church in France has bucked trends seen elsewhere </p>...</source>
