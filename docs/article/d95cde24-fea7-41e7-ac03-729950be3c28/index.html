The phrase usually implies avoiding unethical, illegal, or immoral acts that will get you on the “skyline” of higher-ups or the press. And the Navy SEAL community—an active-duty force of about 2,500 elite commandos—has often been on the skyline.</p><p>“War crimes, drug use, sexual assault on deployment, and homicide are just some of the charges against active-duty SEALs in recent years,” wrote Matthew Cole, journalist and author of<em><a href="https://amzn.to/3EDB8bW"> Code Over Country: The Tragedy and Corruption of SEAL Team Six</a></em><a href="https://amzn.to/3EDB8bW">,</a> in an article <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/22/navy-seals-code-over-country-matthew-cole/">published in February at </a><em><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/02/22/navy-seals-code-over-country-matthew-cole/">The Intercept</a>:</em></p><blockquote><p>“In a span of two years, two <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/7/16604484/seal-team-6-navy-army-green-beret-murder">SEAL Team 6 operators killed a Green Beret while deployed to Mali;</a> a group of SEALs turned in their platoon chief, <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/eddie-gallagher-war-crimes/">Eddie Gallagher</a>, accusing him of an array of war crimes, including the stabbing death of an unarmed, injured&nbsp;Islamic State fighter; <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/07/22/internal-report-exposes-cocaine-abuse-lax-testing-inside-seal-team-10/">rampant drug use was discovered in an East Coast SEAL unit</a>; and an entire SEAL platoon was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/navy-seal-platoon-withdrawn-iraq.html">sent home </a>from a deployment to Iraq after military leaders learned&nbsp;that they’d been drinking excessively and one of the operators was accused of sexual assault.”</p></blockquote><p>More recently, an article in The New York Times exposed a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/us/navy-seal-training-death.html">culture of brutality, cheating and drugs</a>” during initial SEAL training at BUD/S, or Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL. The August exposé came after a candidate died in training; officials uncovered drugs in his car and found about 40 others using drugs to pass the grueling course.</p><p>“What am I going to do with guys like that in a place like Afghanistan?” a senior SEAL leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/30/us/navy-seal-training-death.html">told The Times</a>. “A guy who can do 100 pull-ups but can’t make an ethical decision?” </p><p>The case remains under investigation, but the SEALs have been here before: Scandal erupts, officials promise to reform and institute changes, and the world moves on… until the next scandal.
