"Something is wrong" she said as she handed over the phone to me. It felt like an avalanche had hit my android phone. Video calls, voice calls, text messages, data calls, whats app messages, my phone was on fire. As I stared at the phone the messages kept rolling, one of them said "Your number has been leaked".

The following day I went to the police station close to my house. I sat for about eleven hours, giving details of the calls, the messages, the obnoxious images, the rape and death threats to me and my family.
