It was 2020, and months earlier, Microsoft made global headlines for its <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796758230/microsoft-pledges-to-remove-from-the-atmosphere-all-the-carbon-its-ever-emitted#:~:text=Hourly%20News-,Microsoft%20Pledges%20To%20Remove%20From%20The%20Atmosphere%20All%20The%20Carbon,it%20was%20founded%20in%201975.%22">groundbreaking new commitment</a> to not only become carbon negative by 2030, but to remove from the atmosphere all the climate pollution the company had ever emitted since its 1975 inception by the year 2050.</p><p>Will saw his new role at Microsoft as a way to help fulfill that pledge, and create a climate-friendly model for the rest of Big Tech. As a product manager working on the company’s artificial intelligence platform, he was tasked with developing tools to make it easier for customers to use Microsoft’s AI in an ethical and environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>“I thought it was just the most exciting thing in the world, building the cutting-edge tools and technology that could really help fight climate change,” he recalled. Both Will and Microsoft were adamant that this was the future of AI: <a href="https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2023/11/Microsoft_Accelerating-Sustainability-with-AI-A-Playbook-1.pdf">to help society transition toward a cleaner, greener economy</a>. </p><p>Will poured himself into the job. He created a group called Green AI, dedicated to reducing the carbon footprint of Microsoft’s AI development and operation. He helped build the <a href="https://carbon-aware-sdk.greensoftware.foundation/">CarbonAware SDK</a>, a tool that enables software programs to perform larger processing tasks when electricity is coming from low-carbon sources, and smaller tasks when electricity is coming from fossil fuels. He met his now-wife, Holly Alpine, who was organizing nearly 10,000 Microsoft employees into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rjDLpGdVs8">community to incorporate sustainability</a> into their jobs.</p><p>“I'd say for about a year, year and a half, we were heads down doing good sustainability work,” he said. “Only then did I start to realize who was really using the AI that I was helping build.”</p><h3><strong>“Our paychecks were dripping in oil”</strong></h3><p>Holly, then a senior manager at Microsoft, first learned her employer was selling AI to Big Oil about a year before Will arrived. “It was this really secretive thing,” she recalls.</p><p>In 2019, a high-level employee who worked on climate told Holly about several contracts Microsoft had to help fossil fuel companies increase their production. These companies, she learned, were using Microsoft cloud computing to process seismic data, and then using Microsoft machine learning algorithms and AI to analyze that data, telling them </p>...</source>
