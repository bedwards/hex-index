        <p>Cipro, the common name for an antibiotic once commonly prescribed, is not a safe drug. Cipro is short for Ciprofloxacin, and it is the most familiar antibiotic in a class called Fluoroquinolones.</p><p>Cipro is one of very few drugs that I always had with me when traveling and doing research in Latin America and in Madagascar in the 1990’s, when I was in my 20s.

I fell, sprawled in the sand.</p><p>I knew immediately that this was not a sprain.</p><p>Just before it had happened, I had been jumping in place to stay warm before the next point began, joyful to be playing one of my favorite games in the world, in a beautiful place, with a group of young people who were inquisitive and open. There had been just one thing that nagged at my consciousness—my Achilles tendons hurt just a bit. I had never before given my Achilles tendons a second thought.</p><div><hr></div><p>Achilles was half mortal, half god, and his mother, the sea nymph Thetis, felt betrayed by the fact that her son could die.
