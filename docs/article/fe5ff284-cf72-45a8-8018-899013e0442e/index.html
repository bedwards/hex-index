        <p><em><strong>You can listen to an audio version by clicking the button above. I used AI software (specifically <a href="https://www.understandingai.org/p/i-cloned-my-voice-with-ai-and-my">Descript’s Overdub</a>) to synthesize my voice and included actual audio of sources I quoted in the piece. This took a couple hours of work, so if you would like me to continue doing this with future articles, please let me know by leaving a comment or responding by email. Thanks!</strong></em></p><p>When ChatGPT was released last fall, a lot of white-collar workers had a chilling thought: “could this technology do my job?” A <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/these-are-the-workers-most-worried-that-ai-will-soon-take-their-jobs.html">May survey</a> by CNBC and SurveyMonkey found that almost a quarter of workers fear losing their jobs to AI in the next few years, including 51 percent of workers in advertising and marketing and 46 percent of those in business support and logistics.</p><p>But for one white-collar profession—translators—this stopped being a theoretical question years ago. ChatGPT is based on a neural network architecture called the transformer that was first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">used by Google for machine translation</a> in 2017. So competition from AI has been an everyday reality for human translators for more than five years.</p><p>Marc Eybert-Guillon started his career as a translator in 2017. In 2020, he founded <a href="https://fromthevoid.net/">From the Void</a>, a firm that helps video game makers localize their games for foreign markets.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg" width="1456" height="1155" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1155,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1854803,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7NSZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfce7ad-74da-4d74-bb5a-219fe1ef2701_3024x2398.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Marc Ebert-Guillon is a translator who works on video game localization.

The condemned man looks over at the guy standing next to him on the gallows and asks “first time?”</p><p>“We’ve been ‘in danger’ of being taken over by AI for 10 years now and it still hasn’t happened,” Eybert-Guillon said. “But we keep getting told that it’s going to happen.”</p><p>There are two big reasons AI hasn’t put many human translators out of work. First, human translators still do a better job in specialized fields like law and medicine. Translation errors in these fields can be very expensive, so clients are willing to pay extra for a human-quality translation.</p><p>Second, there has been rapid growth in hybrid translation services where a computer produces a first draft and a human translator checks it for errors. These hybrid services tend to be about 40 percent cheaper than a conventional human translation, and customers have taken advantage of that discount to translate more documents. Translators get paid </p>...</source>
