        <p>Narendra Modi’s decade in power has been marked by an aggressive push for Hindu nationalism, recasting the idea of India from a secular democracy into a majoritarian state. While this ideological shift may have consolidated political power at home, it has come at a steep price abroad. India’s foreign policy—once rooted in non-alignment, pluralism, and soft power—is now faltering, increasingly shaped and limited by domestic identity politics. The result: strained alliances, emboldened rivals, and a loss of moral leadership in the region. Now, in the wake of the latest India-Pakistan conflict, India’s global relationships are being tested more severely than ever. One of the starkest casualties of this transformation has been India's relationship with Bangladesh. Once entrenched in strong ties under Sheikh Hasina’s long tenure, the relationship has frayed significantly. </p><p>Following a student-led uprising in 2024, Hasina who enjoyed an extremely favourable relationship with New Delhi was ousted from power and subsequently took refuge in India. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has since banned the activities of Hasina’s Awami League party, marking a major political shift in Dhaka.</p><p> India is yet to respond to the Bangladesh government's request for the extradition of Hasina over allegations of human rights abuses and corruption.

Bangladesh's interim Chief Adviser, Muhammad Yunus, was invited by Chinese President Xi Jinping for an official visit to Beijing. The meeting took place on March 28, 2025, at the Great Hall of the People. During this visit, Yunus and Xi discussed various aspects of bilateral cooperation, including economic partnerships and regional stability. Notably, Yunus called for China to play a "greater role" in ensuring peace, reflecting Bangladesh's desire for a more active Chinese involvement in regional affairs . </p><p>This visit marked Yunus's first bilateral trip since assuming office and was seen as a significant step in strengthening ties between Bangladesh and China. This development is particularly noteworthy in the context of shifting regional alliances and India's evolving foreign policy. Bangladesh's increasing engagement with China and Pakistan, especially ...</p>
