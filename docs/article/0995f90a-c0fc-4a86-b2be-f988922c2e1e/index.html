He was still strong and thin, active, especially in the summers. He still threw batting practice a few times a week and golfed several times a month through the summer. He and Adele would often take a walk after dinner, and if he found himself sitting too long watching TV at night, he would do 10 or 15 or 20 push-ups before bed, just ...</p>
