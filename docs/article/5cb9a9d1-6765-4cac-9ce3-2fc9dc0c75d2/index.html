Their resulting model is 0.9B parameters (versus ~1-2B for other similarly small-sized models) and obtains decent but not state-of-the-art scores on video quality.<br>   To make the model, they started with a 2B parameter Diffusion Transformer then 'pruned' it to get it down to under a billion parameters so it could fit on an iPhone. They also do finetuning to take this pruned model and get it to generate higher quality outputs.<br>    The results are quite good - I'd encourage readers to <a href="https://snap-research.github.io/mobile_video_dit/">check out the site</a> to get a feel for them.<br><br><strong>Why this matters: </strong>Soon, your phone will be generating not just on-device text and images, but videos, as this research shows. And then a little after that, perhaps entire worlds (via massively optimized world models, which will be the successors of things like Genie3). This all points to a future where everyone is surrounded by "instant imagination", and will unlock a broad range of applications.<br>    <strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13343">Taming Diffusion Transformer for Real-Time Mobile Video Generation (arXiv)</a>.<br>   <strong>View samples</strong> from the <a href="https://snap-research.github.io/mobile_video_dit/">model at the project page (Snap Research, GitHub)</a>.<br><br>***<br><br><strong>AI2 gets $152 million for building an open AI ecosystem:<br></strong><em>…NSF and NVIDIA fund the research non-profit…<br></em>The National Science Foundation has awarded $75m to the AI research organization the Allen Institute for AI Research (AI2), and NVIDIA has awarded it $77m as well. "The partnership supports the NSF Mid-Scale Research Infrastructure project, Open Multimodal AI Infrastructure to Accelerate Science (OMAI)," AI2 writes in a post announcing the funding. "OMAI will build a national level fully open AI ecosystem to drive scientific discovery through AI, while also advancing the science of AI itself."<br><br><strong>Why this matters - your tax dollars are (effectively!) being </strong>...</p>
