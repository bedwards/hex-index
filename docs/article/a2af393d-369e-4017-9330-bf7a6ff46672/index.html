        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions the Samuel Richardson Award, which the book was entered for. Understanding who Samuel Richardson was—an 18th-century English novelist who pioneered the epistolary novel form with works like Pamela and Clarissa—provides context for what kind of literary tradition this award honors.</p>

        <p>During my twenties, my friends would circle constantly circle around the same topic. They would ask, “Should I go for a career that earns money? Or a career that helps people?”</p><p>I personally had chosen a career that neither earns money <em>nor</em> helps people (writing fiction), so I couldn’t empathize, but I still had many, many conversations with various friends on this subject. It was probably the defining drama for my slice of the Millennial generation.</p><p>But I’ve never seen an examination of this topic in literature. That’s why I was so drawn to Peter Shull’s <em>Why Teach?</em> when I first came across a review in Isaac Kolding’s blog.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> I immediately bought the book, as I often do after reading a review.

But recently I remembered this book and decided to actually open it.</p><p>I spent the next three hours reading the book from cover to cover, very transported and impressed.</p><p>The reason people don’t write books about this kind of conflict—what should I do with my life?—is that it’s very difficult to dramatize. There’s a risk that you’ll end up with a lot of rumination and not enough suspense. Because ultimately, how can this kind of conflict get resolved?

The novel is about a young man, in his mid-twenties, who is employed as an English teacher at a school in his hometown in Kansas. The protagonist, William, loves literature, but does not love teaching—something he makes clear at the beginning of the book:</p><blockquote><p>The truth of the matter was that I never planned to teach, never wanted to be a teacher. Not that I hadn’t liked school, or been good at it. I had; I was. But the profession never held an allure for me as it does for some. Not once did I ever look at one of my own teachers and think Yes. That. I would like to do what he (or more likely she) does for a living. To the contrary, if someone had told me when I was a 17- or 18-year-old that I would </p>...</blockquote>
