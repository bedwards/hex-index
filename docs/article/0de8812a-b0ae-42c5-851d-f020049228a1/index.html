        <p>Today, we’re discussing all things gaming in China! Our illustrious guest is <a href="https://danielcamilo.substack.com/">Daniel Camilo</a>, a Portuguese national who has spent over a decade in the Chinese video game industry. We cover the most important titles, publishing and development trends, and where the industry is headed.</p><p><strong>We discuss:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>How China’s game industry climbed the value chain from low-cost mobile and PC titles to globally competitive AAA releases,</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why </strong><em><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></em><strong> reset global expectations, becoming the template for live-service “cash cows,”</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>China’s domestic market’s newfound self-sufficiency, as hundreds of millions of middle-class gamers mean Chinese developers no longer need international success,</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Steam’s magical liminal status in China as a de facto gateway for uncensored and imported games,</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why gaming is a global language in ways movies and music aren’t, and how mechanics and genres travel even when stories don’t,</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The </strong><em><strong>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</strong></em><strong> controversy, where nationalist backlash led to patched-out boss deaths and preemptive self-censorship.</strong></p></li></ul><p>We also cover Daniel’s pick for the biggest Chinese game of 2026, the looming <em>Genshin</em>-style live-service bubble, and how a game set in 1984 East Germany channels distinctly Chinese workplace anxiety.</p><p>Listen now on <a href="https://pod.link/1289062927">your favorite podcast app</a>.</p><h1>How China Leveled Up</h1><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> Watching the industry’s industrial upgrading has been fascinating. It mirrors other Chinese sectors — starting with straightforward, low-capital commercial products, simple 2D PC games and free-to-play mobile titles, and moving up the value chain. Now, Chinese developers are taking big swings with AAA titles featuring eight-figure budgets and quality rivaling global studios. Daniel, is that a reasonable generalization of the past decade?</p><p><strong>Daniel Camilo:</strong> Mobile remains the largest market slice, but if I want to highlight one title that changed everything — <em><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/i/163556575/how-chinas-gen-z-is-exporting-chinese-soft-power-to-the-world">Genshin Impact</a></em>. Even before <em><a href="https://gamesci.cn/wukong/">Black Myth: Wukong</a></em>, <em>Genshin</em> shifted expectations. It was a free-to-play title available across platforms that felt like an AAA experience. It demonstrated an ambition and scale previously unseen from Chinese developers — or any mobile developers, for that matter.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> Give us a primer on <em><a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/">Genshin Impact</a></em>. Who made it, and how big was it?</p><p><strong>Daniel Camilo:</strong> <em>Genshin Impact</em> was made by miHoYo and it was released in 2020 as a free-to-play, open-world, story-driven RPG with anime-inspired aesthetics.
