        <p>Greetings everyone - </p><p>The year is drawing to an end, and that means every other link you click is a Best of 2025 list. And you know what, that’s just fine; if you’re at all like me, you just keep on clicking. Give me more of the best stuff, show me what all the best stuff was, I can’t get enough of it. And I’ll tell you what, I’m even going to contribute to this benevolent plague of listmaking, because I haven’t yet seen what I want, and what dear readers of this newsletter might want: A guide to the media that critically examined the role of technology in politics, culture, and society. </p><p>Speaking of those readers: Permit me to embrace the season of sentimentality and get real with you all for a minute here before we get onto the lists. I want to say thank you for reading, discussing, and supporting this work through what was a particularly dark year. When I went <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-tech-oligarchs-and-their-ai-are">all in on this thing back in February</a>, I really had no idea whether it could become a monetarily viable long-term undertaking aka a job. As <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-to-win-followers-and-influence">I recently discussed at (much) greater length</a>, you’ve all shown me it can be. I still have a lot of work to do and goals to meet. But I count myself as beyond fortunate to be able to do this work, on my terms: to try make sense of the world of AI and its impact on the working class, to document the rise of the tech oligarchy, and to write long-winded reviews of Frankenstein. </p><p>There are now 33,000 beautiful machine breaking subscribers here, many more than I would have predicted this time last year. Cheers to you all, with an extra emphatic thanks to those of you who support this work with your hard-earned cash—it’s you who quite actually make all of this materially possible, and I would not have been able to do any of this without you. There would be no <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/s/ai-killed-my-job">AI Killed My Job</a> stories, no investigations into <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-weaponization-of-waymo">LA’s torched Waymos of LA</a>, no dispatches from <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-luddite-renaissance-is-in-full">the frontlines of the Luddite renaissance</a>. Thanks again everyone. </p><p>I’m going to take a couple weeks off for the holidays here, though hopefully this ~8 million word edition will help tide you over, and I’ve scheduled another special post or two to help fill the gap. ...</p>
