The festival is also known as “Singles Day” — a name that plays on the date November 11th (11/11), where the four ones represent single people.</p><p>For many, Double 11 this year was underwhelming. </p><p>The festival lasted five weeks, beginning in mid-October—its earliest start yet—as retailers desperately sought to stimulate spending amid subdued consumer sentiment.</p><p><a href="https://www.realtimemandarin.com/p/251-chinas-double-11-shopping-festival">Which brings us to the phrase itself:</a></p><blockquote><p><em>“Lately, more and more people have been reminiscing online about <strong>the beauty of the economic upturn</strong> during the 2010s.”</em></p><p><em>最近刷到越来越多人开始怀念10年代<strong>经济上行期的美</strong>。</em></p></blockquote><p>And with that, we have our Sinica Phrase of the Week.</p><h3><strong>What it means</strong></h3><p>“The beauty of the economic upturn” (经济上行期的美) is a self-explanatory phrase.

The phrase captures a sense of what used to be “a promising future” (未来可期) — the belief that tomorrow will be better than today.</p><p>It refers to the period between roughly 2001 and 2015, when China’s economy maintained around double-digit growth and quality of life seemed to improve every year. People were visibly getting wealthier. Upward mobility felt tangible. Opportunities appeared to be everywhere.</p><p>Many people also reflect nostalgically over the fashion of that time. It’s best described as the Chinese version of “bling”: exaggerated hairstyles, flashy clothes, and large designer logos.</p><p>It was also a more tolerant and open time.</p><p>Cultural expression was freer, public discussion more vibrant. Writers became celebrities for critical essays, celebrated rather than silenced.</p><p>This sense of increasing economic freedom and wealth defined the early days of Double 11, which started in 2009.
