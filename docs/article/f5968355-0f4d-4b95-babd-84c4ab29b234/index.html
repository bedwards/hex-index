          <strong>YIMBY</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on pro-development housing policies and the debate between supply-side housing advocates and their critics. Understanding the YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard) movement provides essential context for the policy battles over parking requirements, occupancy limits, and missing middle housing that Qadri champions.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions &#039;missing-middle options&#039; as a key housing reform. This urban planning concept—housing types between single-family homes and large apartment buildings—is central to understanding the land use changes Austin is implementing to increase housing supply.</p>

          <strong>Rent regulation</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s core claim is that Austin rents fell 10% due to supply-side policies rather than rent control. Understanding the economics and history of rent regulation provides valuable context for evaluating the competing approaches to housing affordability debated by Qadri and his opponents.</p>
