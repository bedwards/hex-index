        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly references how Republicans drew district lines to maintain advantage, mentioning &#039;obvious product of Republican gerrymandering&#039; and districts drawn as &#039;weird strips&#039; to keep parties in power. Understanding the history and mechanics of gerrymandering provides crucial context for why these Texas districts have the shapes and partisan leans they do.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The author casually mentions &#039;a few sundown towns&#039; in East Texas when describing TX01. Many readers may not know the specific history of these communities that excluded Black Americans after dark through intimidation and violence, which directly relates to the article&#039;s discussion of Black voter turnout and Democratic organizing in East Texas.</p>

And the reason is that <a href="https://goelect.txelections.civixapps.com/ivis-cbp-ui/candidate-information">the Secretary of State</a> is only showing the two major primary elections at this time. Maybe I can find it elsewhere, but do the Green Party and Libertarians even have primary elections in Texas? No, they don’t. So, I’ll add them when the SOS adds them for the general ballot.</p><p>There are some Independents (*cough cough Mike Collier*) who are running as Independents but hoping to get Democratic voters. Of course, my feelings have always been that if you want Democratic votes, you should probably run as a Democrat. 🤷🏻‍♀️   </p><p>Let’s talk about the Democratic Congressional primaries. (Under the 2025 map.)</p><h4>TX01</h4><p>We’re going to start with TX01, and I’m going to tell you it’s a long shot, but keep reading because there really aren’t too many long shots (surprisingly) for Democrats. However, this is a good opportunity for Democrats to chip away at Republican dominance in East Texas and build infrastructure. </p><p>TX01 is rural East Texas and consists of a lot of small towns, a few sundown towns, and is heavily Republican at the federal level despite a sizable Black population in some counties. Nathaniel Moran (R) is the incumbent here, and God forgive me, I have such a hard time with his name, because every time I see him, he’s speaking slowly and his mouth is hanging open. </p><p>Running for this seat are <a href="https://www.tracyandrusforuscongress.com/">Rev. Dr. Tracy Andrus</a>, <a href="https://www.masikaakilahray.com/">Masika Ray</a>, <a href="https://www.daxforcongress.com/">Dax Alexander</a>, and Yolanda Prince. </p><p>This is one of the few districts that has an Anglo majority, 60%, an obvious product of Republican gerrymandering. Realistically, Democrats would have to overperform by something like +35 points to flip </p>...</source>
