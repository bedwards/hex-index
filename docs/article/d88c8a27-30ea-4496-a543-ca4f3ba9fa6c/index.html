The board is making an effort to show that it can prove useful during an unfolding crisis. But given the speed and scale of the conflict —&nbsp;and Meta’s cool reception to many of the board’s recent ideas — it’s unclear whether the result will go much beyond restoring a couple of posts to Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>On Thursday the Oversight Board, a Meta-funded but independent body that is empowered to make binding decisions about whether posts on the company’s apps should come down or stay up, <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/318968857762747-oversight-board-announces-new-cases-on-israel-hamas-conflict-for-expedited-review/?_hsmi=285584870&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_hoMSPfFlDgLIpatsdR4OzfAjNz4l1fv3gQ_f3HFWHqXE0ndUy2KqE7bymQLgEwMDSUm8LNExGp0W41lXGl9uj1gRT5g">announced it would take two cases stemming from the Israel-Hamas war</a>. For the first time, the board said it would conduct its review on an expedited basis —&nbsp;meaning that its decision could come in <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/943702317007222-oversight-board-announces-plans-to-review-more-cases-and-appoints-a-new-board-member/">as soon as 48 hours, and up to 30 days</a>. (Regular decisions typically take the board about three months.)&nbsp;</p><p>The first case selected today concerns an Instagram post:</p><blockquote><p>[It] includes a video showing what appears to be the aftermath of a strike on a yard outside Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The content, which was posted on Instagram in early November, shows people, including children, injured or dead, lying on the ground and/or crying. A caption in Arabic and English below the video states that the hospital has been targeted by the “usurping occupation,” a reference to the Israeli army, and tags human rights and news organizations. Meta initially removed the post for violating its rules on <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/violent-graphic-content/">violent and graphic content</a>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The second is a Facebook post.</p><blockquote><p>[It] shows a woman begging her kidnappers not to kill her as she is taken hostage and driven away on a motorbike. The woman is seen sitting on the back of the motorbike, reaching out and pleading for her life. The video then shows a man, who appears to be another hostage, being marched away by captors. In a caption, the user who posted the content describes the kidnappers as Hamas militants and urges people to watch the video to gain a “deeper understanding” of the horror that Israel woke up to on October 7, 2023. The user posted the content around a week after the </p></blockquote>...</source>
