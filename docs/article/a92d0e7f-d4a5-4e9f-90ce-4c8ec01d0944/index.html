        <p>Hey there,</p><p>It’s been a while.</p><p>When I started <em>Emerging Markets Today</em> back in 2023, the idea was simple: use this newsletter to drop quick notes every time a new podcast episode went live.</p><p>But here we are in 2025, and a lot has changed — in emerging markets and in how I want to run this project.</p><p>So I’m officially rebooting this Substack.</p><p>Going forward, this newsletter will be more than just podcast episode alerts. You’ll get<strong> one post a week</strong> — sometimes a quick take, sometimes a deeper dive, sometimes reflections based on conversations from the podcast.</p><h3>What to Expect:</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Sharp insights</strong> from across Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and beyond</p></li><li><p><strong>Stories and voices</strong> you won’t hear on mainstream channels</p></li><li><p><strong>Commentary that connects the dots</strong> between finance, tech, and real-world impact</p></li><li><p>And yes — the occasional podcast drop too, with takeaways or behind-the-scenes notes</p></li></ul><p>I’m keeping this simple: one post a week, right here in your inbox.</p><p>If you’ve been subscribed since the early days — thank you for sticking around. If you’re new here, welcome.</p><p>Let’s explore what’s next for emerging markets — together. In the meantime you can have a look at the <a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/">Emerging Markets Today</a> site.</p><p>More soon,<br><strong>Ana Paula</strong></p><p>🟢 <em>P.S. Know someone who’s into fintech, innovation, or global development? Feel free to forward this or share the Substack.</em></p>
