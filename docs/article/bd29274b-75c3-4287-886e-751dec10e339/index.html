The Turkish Straits (Bosporus and Dardanelles) are the only passage between the Black Sea and global markets, making their legal regime under the Montreux Convention crucial to understanding why Turkey has leverage in this situation.</p>

        <p><em>“I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.”</em> – Everett Dirksen</p><p>In late September, French naval forces boarded and immobilized the <em>Boracay</em>, a Benin-flagged oil tanker sailing off of France’s Atlantic coast. Carrying crude from Russia to India, the <em>Boracay</em> is part of what Western leaders call the “Russian shadow fleet,” a term with no legal standing under international law that refers to sanctioned ships insured by non-Western entities. Russian President Vladimir Putin blasted the move as piracy in neutral waters. After a short news cycle, the ship was released and allowed to continue its course.</p><p>Two months later, attacks on the sanctioned fleet escalated dramatically. Several tankers were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9ky5z2gx0o">struck</a> by naval drones, actions for which the Ukrainian Security Service has openly taken responsibility. Another was apparently hit just <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraines-sbu-conducts-new-sea-baby-drone-strike-on-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-in-black-sea-source-says/">yesterday</a>. Although no lives were lost, the flagrant attacks against unarmed ships caused outrage in many countries. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey publicly condemned the assaults as “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-attacks-black-sea-commercial-ships-unacceptable-2025-12-01/">unacceptable</a>” and issued a stern warning that they should halt.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png" width="1456" height="962" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:962,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:970940,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://newsletter.doomberg.com/i/181156552?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LKJn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F751b9437-b087-4cf6-b1e7-fb975c3037d9_1540x1018.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Seems reckless | Reuters</figcaption></figure></div><p>Stopping these tankers from transporting Russian oil has become an obsession for Western leaders, who believe the associated money brought in is critical to financing Russia’s war effort. The thinking goes that if these ships are blocked and that revenue is cut off, Russia’s economy will suffer significant damage and Putin will be forced to the negotiating table in a weakened position. Considering that there are approximately <a href="https://united24media.com/latest-news/how-many-tankers-does-the-russian-shadow-fleet-have-14061">1,240 ships</a> in the shadow fleet, it seems an unlikely goal to achieve, but the recent bout of attacks is certainly having <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5962cf4-aec1-445e-805e-0122d43d67be">an impact</a> on global logistics:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The cost of war risk insurance for ships sailing through the Black Sea — a critical trade zone for commodities such as grain and oil — jumped after attacks by Ukrainian special forces on infrastructure including Russia’s Novorossiysk port.</em></p><p><em>War risk insurance prices have risen from about 0.25 to 0.3 per cent of a ship’s value in early November to between 0.5 and 0.75 per cent this week, Marcus Baker, head of marine and cargo for broker Marsh, told the Financial Times, bringing price rises to as much as 250 per cent.</em></p><p><em>A commodities insurance broker at another firm said that prices for their clients had risen more than 200 per cent.</em>”</p></blockquote><p>As we have long <a href="https://newsletter.doomberg.com/p/crazy-pills">argued</a>, </p>...</source>
