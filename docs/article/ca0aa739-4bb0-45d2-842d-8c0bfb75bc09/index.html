      <p><span>I am joined by the philosopher Mladen Dolar, one of the most important Lacanian philosophers working today. A founder of the Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis, Mladen Dolar has written important works on Hegel, Marx and numerous works on Lacanian thought. In this podcast, we discuss his experience studying with Lacan in Paris and the legacy of the 1960s on today's politics. We then turn to a discussion of Dolar's new book </span><em>Rumors</em><span>, a philosophical essay on the persistent problem of rumors from the time of Socrates to the present.</span></p><p><span>We examine how Socrates, Rousseau, Kafka and Kierkegaard each faced the problem of rumors and sought to overcome the stain of rumors on philosophy. Dolar writes that “rumors present another face of the big other, not the face of knowledge and truth but something that nobody quite believes to be true yet it unfailingly works and is given a questionable credence and general currency.” Learn more about Mladen Dolar's new book </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbi1pRWN6bGZ3Tjh6NUVRaHIwaWZYVWRMemJYd3xBQ3Jtc0trNEw2cUlBTTdlTVFseVRELWFqWVZyU1dNc3c1RV82dnVrSVZOeGE4X1VtWG50aVBtdzcwUGFWeVBwalJjOUd3UFNlcFR0VzR6WDg2eW96a0hZd2RmSjlYUUFBUmtrUkV4bGpqUmlTT2RPMEFCekJCQQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F4b7WlJJ&amp;v=IXx0Dv_4-zw" rel="">https://amzn.to/4b7WlJJ</a></p>
