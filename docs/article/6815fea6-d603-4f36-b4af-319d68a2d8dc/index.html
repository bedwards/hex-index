In one corner, we have Ryan Coogler’s Southern Gothic vampire extravaganza <em>Sinners</em>, a massive spring-season hit and a film being treated as a profound meditation on the intergenerational trauma of the Black experience and a radical reclamation of American roots music. In the other, we have Paul Thomas Anderson’s Thomas Pynchon riff <em>One Battle After Another</em>, which is being hailed as a generational masterpiece, a bracing portrait of an America coming apart and a kind of prophetic pre-autopsy of the MAGA era. These are movies that sold a lot of tickets, earned stellar reviews, and which thrilled me as cinematic experiences… and they’ve both achieved rare heights in the world of commentary, analysis, and debate<em>. </em>In the 21st century, beyond profit, beyond critical commendation, important movies are defined by their ability to generate <em>discourse.</em></p><p>And look, I want to be clear that I liked both of these movies, very much. I really, truly did. I had a great time watching both. I don’t dispute that they’re excellent, riveting movies; I’m not wearing my hater hat today. But I think that both have been the subject of a particular kind of overheated praise that you see a lot these days: they’re fundamentally fun-but-shallow exercises in action filmmaking that are being hung with implied depth they don’t contain. And, worse, they each seem to be playing for that kind of recognition, and to their detriment. Both <em>Sinners </em>and <em>One Battle After Another </em>are very good movies that would be even better if they didn’t take unnecessary swipes at profundity that they can’t achieve. Which is a shame! The world needs this kind of exceptionally well-crafted fun movie, built with vision and profound seriousness. Not every movie has to reach for artistic depth if such depth doesn’t emerge from it organically.</p><p>In <em>Sinners,</em> twin brothers return to 1930s Mississippi to open a juke joint, but their attempt at building an artistic space for their community (that is, a Black Southern community in the depths of Jim Crow) turns into </p>...</source>
