In search of dinner, Scottie and I rounded the edges of pond after pond at the sandpits, looking and looking. We saw not a single frog. We heard not one deep-throated bellow. In Southern towns where creeks and ponds proliferate, frogging is not unusual. What followed, however, was. Quite.</p><p>After darkness fell on the unusually cool evening, Scottie and I loaded our gear into my old 1949 Plymouth Coupe (bought for $50) and headed for the sandpits near the golf course on the edge of town. I knew from prior hunts that our quarry was there by the dozens.</p><p>Decades before, truckloads of sand had been dug and hauled out for construction and cement. Left abandoned were about 25 gaping holes — large and small, deep and shallow. Over the decades, rain filled them. In time, water lilies and cattails sprouted; critters filtered in. These old ponds now were fully populated by frogs, tadpoles, snakes, turtles and other creatures.</p><p>Frogging requires strong illumination. Thus, I carried a powerful, five-cell flashlight with a tight beam. Because houses were nearby, instead of our usual .22 rifle, we had a quieter, far more primitive device — a gig. This is basically a steel fish spear with three or four barbed prongs mounted on a 10-foot bamboo pole. Scottie was the gig bearer; I was the spotter.</p><p>In darkness, the eyes of a bullfrog glow bright yellow when a strong light is shone at them. The technique is simple. Find a frog sitting at the water’s edge waiting for bugs: The person with the light blinds the creature, while the other sneaks up quietly from behind and spears </p>...</source>
