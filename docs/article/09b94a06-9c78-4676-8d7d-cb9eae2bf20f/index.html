He notes that American brutality in Japan and Iraq was never genocidal — despite the much higher death tolls — because the Americans never contemplated population extermination or extraction. </p><p>The thing is that Israel’s neighbours have never accepted her. Not in 1936. Not in 1948 or 1956 or 1967 or 1973 or 2000 or 2006 or 2023. What happened on October 7 2023 was celebrated on the streets of Gaza. Israel has many problems, but antagonising Gazans is not one of them: they have already maximally hated the Jews for a very long time. </p><p>My view is that Israel’s actions in Gaza are not genocidal, and the future in the region as messy as ever.
