        <p>With an eye to the dilemmas and possibilities of having a socialist mayor in New York City, last month I published an <a href="https://www.laborpolitics.com/p/sewer-socialism-in-wisconsin-and">article</a> on the lessons of Wisconsin’s so-called sewer socialists, who governed Milwaukee for almost fifty years. It drew more readers than normal — as well as more blowback. To quote one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericblanc.bsky.social/post/3m63f3p5yds2j">critic</a>, “Victor Berger was the godfather of the ‘sewer socialist’ movement and was also incredibly racist against Black people.” </p><p>Another <a href="https://www.marxistunity.com/light-and-air/socialisminonecity">polemical response</a> insisted that white supremacist views were not a personal flaw of Berger. Rather, they arose from the sewer socialists’ “appeal to the lowest-common-denominator instincts of the workers whose votes they depended on, including racism.” Such criticisms <a href="https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/812-the-american-socialist-movement-1897-1912">echo</a> a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/2716273">historiographic</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/blackmilwaukeema00trot">consensus</a>, which for over 75 years has <a href="https://www.thepromptmag.com/advancing-black-liberation-doesnt-fit-agenda-whats-left-us/">painted</a> Berger as America’s prime <a href="https://jacobin.com/2015/08/debs-socialism-race-du-bois-socialist-party-black-liberation/">example</a> of a <a href="https://mygaryislike.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/blacks-in-and-out-of-the-left-michael-c-dawson.pdf">racist</a> white socialist. Even otherwise sympathetic <a href="https://archive.org/details/victorbergerprom0000mill">portrayals</a> of Berger have <a href="https://moving-the-social.ub.rub.de/index.php/MTS/article/view/10026/9520">suggested</a> he remained a bigot his whole life.</p><p>Before I started researching Milwaukee’s socialists, I assumed that the consensus view was accurate. And that’s why I was so surprised to stumble across a 1929 obituary on Berger from Milwaukee’s NAACP <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ndnp/whi/batch_whi_italico_ver01/data/sn83045293/00542869094/1929081001/0325.pdf">praising</a> “the very broad and sympathetic views Mr. Berger always had regarding us as a race, the unbiased attitude of his paper, <em>The Milwaukee Leader</em>, and his interest in the welfare of all.” How could one square this NAACP assessment with Berger’s infamous 1902 <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/social-democratic-herald-us/020531-socdemherald-v04n48w200.pdfhttps://www.marxists.org/history/usa/pubs/social-democratic-herald-us/020531-socdemherald-v04n48w200.pdf">declaration</a> that “there can be no doubt that the negroes and mulattoes constitute a lower race—that the Caucasian and even the Mongolian have the start on them in civilization by many thousand years”? Maybe the Milwaukee NAACP was just saying something polite but inaccurate about an influential dead man?</p><p>Searching for answers, I started systematically reading <em>The Milwaukee Leader</em>, the newspaper that Berger founded in 1913 and edited until he was killed by a trolley car in 1929. What I found surprised me. It turns out that generation after generation of historians had somehow managed to overlook a remarkable transformation: not only did Berger eventually ditch white supremacist views, but he and his paper became ardently anti-racist during the 1920s, a decade when most of white America in both the North and South actively embraced Jim Crow. Using his bully pulpit as America’s first Socialist congressman, Berger became one of the country’s highest-profile white fighters against lynching, racism, imperialism, and nativism.</p><p>This is an important story to tell. One-sided portrayals of Berger have ...</p>
