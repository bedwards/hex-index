        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions Avi Loeb as the Harvard astrophysicist who proposed that interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could be an artificial probe. His controversial scientific positions and distinguished career make for substantial educational reading.</p>

        <p>The fireworks of awe-inspiring configurations of the last months are over since the first weekend of December when the last of the grand water trines became exact. The subtle current that carried us through October and November with a certain effortless grace is slowly subsiding, giving way to a more focused energy. The remaining weeks before Saturn and Neptune meet precisely on the Aries point (to finally ring in the new era) will be peculiar in their own way. It looks as if all the fast-moving planets have decided to concentrate forces in Sagittarius this month to then jointly march on into the signs of Capricorn and Aquarius:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png" width="1456" height="560" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:560,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:694467,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://cosmiccompanion.substack.com/i/181324832?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XxV9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13621a4f-768e-4e9d-8afd-a084fa651f08_1835x706.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>However, what sounds like an easy journey for our planetary bunch might initially get off to a rather unwieldy start: Whether it’s Mars, the Sun, Venus or Mercury, they will all have to pass Saturn’s reality checkpoint this month and deal with the uncertainty and vagueness of Neptune. For us, this can feel like a lot of energy damming up from the middle of December on until Christmas, asking us to question, reevaluate and let go of old expectations and assumptions. With all these planets in Sagittarius squaring Saturn and Neptune, we could get a course correction wherever we have been too optimistic, naïve or over-confident particularly concerning our vision of a free world and some of our cherished ideals. Those of you who have planetary placements in the last degrees of Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius or Pisces will be especially sensitive to this potential challenge to whatever you know and have so far believed in. With an attitude of sincere humbleness, though, we might be able to keep the faith while successfully adapting to the changing circumstances of these times of transition.</p><p><strong>The 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of December</strong></p><p>The 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of December will fall right into the peak time of this planetary ‘congestion’ and challenge to our beliefs, the very days when all eyes will probably be on the interstellar comet 3i/Atlas because it will be closest to Earth then. The internet has been abuzz with speculations about whether this is an alien artefact or just an unusual comet as claimed by NASA. Astrology cannot answer this question, of course, but it is interesting that this astronomical peculiarity has sparked a serious debate about our understanding of human civilization within the context of the universe, a </p>...</source>
