        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references pre-Reagan tax rates and blames Reagan-era policies for wealth inequality.

Every time Trump or his lapdogs in Congress tell voters that the economy is terrific, they seem more out of touch.</p><p>A significant number of Democrats have won elections over the last 10 months — mayoral, gubernatorial, and special elections — by stressing <em>affordability.</em></p><p>Democrats can show America that they can be better trusted than Republicans to bring prices down and real wages up by promising 10 things.</p><p>***</p><h4>         The Democrats’ Pledge to Make America Affordable Again</h4><p><strong>1. We’ll eliminate Trump’s across-the-board tariffs.</strong> They’re import taxes that are raising the prices of just about everything American consumers buy. We’ll eliminate them where their costs to consumers are far higher than any potential benefits in the form of new jobs.</p><p><strong>2. We’ll bust up monopolies.</strong> Another major source of high prices is monopolies — especially in high tech, health care, food, and finance. We’ll vigorously enforce antitrust (anti-monopoly) laws so that corporations don’t have the power to raise prices. We’ll bust up giant corporations. We’ll bar large firms from merging or acquiring other firms. </p><p><strong>3. We’ll fight for stronger unions. </strong>Workers need more bargaining power to get higher wages. Part of the answer is stronger unions. Democrats will make it easier for them to start or join them. </p><p><strong>4. We’ll raise the national minimum wage to $20 an hour. </strong>No one who works full-time should be in poverty. And we’ll raise it even higher for employees of big corporations that pay their top executives more than 200 times the typical worker. </p><p><strong>5. We’ll make housing more affordable. </strong>We’ll stop private equity firms from buying up large tracts of housing and colluding on prices. We’ll get rid of zoning laws that keep housing prices high. And we’ll raise taxes on big corporations that drive up housing prices where they’re headquartered or have major facilities and use the funds for more affordable housing there. </p><p><strong>6. We’ll cut health care costs by making Medicare available to everyone. </strong>Giving everyone the option of buying into Medicare would bring health care costs down because it’s cheaper and more efficient than private for-profit health insurance.  </p><p><strong>7. We’ll get working families help with child care and elder care. </strong>Both are essential for working families who must now pay out large portions of their incomes to provide care for family members. </p><p><strong>8. We’ll give working families paid family leave. </strong>Twelve </p>...</source>
