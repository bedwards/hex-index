        <p>AI data centers use water. Like any other industry that uses water, they require careful planning. If an electric car factory opens near you, <a href="https://cityofcovington.org/ckeditorfiles/files/2025_Water_OneWaterResourcesAnalysis2024.pdf">that factory may use just as much water as a data center</a>. The factory also requires careful planning. But the idea that either the factory or AI is using an inordinate amount of water that merits any kind of boycott or national attention as a unique serious environmental issue is innumerate. Individual data centers can sometimes stress local water systems in the way other industries do, but when you use AI, you are not contributing to a significant problem for water management compared to most other things you do in your day to day life. On the national, local, and personal level, AI is barely using any water, and unless it grows 50 times faster than forecasts predict, this won’t change. I’m writing from an American context and don’t know as much about other countries. But at least in America, the numbers are clear and decisive.</p><p>The idea that AI’s water usage is a serious national emergency caught on for three reasons:</p><ul><li><p>People get upset at the idea of a physical resource like water being spent on a digital product, especially one they don’t see value in, and don’t factor in just how often this happens everywhere.</p></li><li><p>People haven’t internalized how many other people are using AI. AI’s water use looks ridiculous if you think of it as a small marginal new thing. It looks tiny when you divide it by the hundreds of millions of people using AI every day.</p></li><li><p>People are easily alarmed by contextless large numbers, like the number of gallons of water a data center is using. They compare these large numbers to other regular things they do, not to other normal industries and processes in society. They aren’t aware of how much water society uses on other normal industries.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these create the impression that AI water use is a problem. It is not. Regardless of whether you love or hate AI, it is not possible to actually look at the numbers involved without coming to the conclusion that this is a fake problem. This problem’s hyped up for clicks by a lot of scary articles that completely fall apart when you look at the simple easy-to-access facts on the ground. These articles have contributed to establishing fake “common wisdom” ...</p>
