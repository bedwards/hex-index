        <p class="topic-summary">Central to understanding why quantum computers threaten current cryptography - this is the specific quantum algorithm that could break RSA and elliptic curve cryptography used in Bitcoin and blockchains. The article&#039;s discussion of &#039;cryptographically relevant quantum computers&#039; directly relates to when Shor&#039;s algorithm becomes practical.</p>

        <h5>INNOVATION BETS</h5><h2>TradFi’s tipping point: Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson on stablecoins, Bitcoin, and more</h2><p>Fidelity Chairman and CEO Abigail Johnson takes us inside the institution’s decade-long journey in crypto — from early Bitcoin mining to building custody infrastructure that other institutions now rely on, to thoughts on stablecoins then vs. now and on how the company decides what to build vs. buy. </p><p>Johnson reveals (in conversation with a16z crypto COO <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/team/anthony-albanese/">Anthony Albanese</a>) how Fidelity sifted through dozens of use cases, why only one truly mattered at first, and how that early insight set the course for everything that followed.  </p><p>Whether you’re a traditional finance institution exploring crypto, a startup seeking to partner with TradFi, or just someone who wants to understand how innovation happens inside large, established institutions — this episode is your guide to what we’ve been calling “<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/state-of-crypto-report-2025/#financial-institutions-have-embraced-crypto">The Year of Institutional Adoption</a>” and beyond. </p><div id="youtube2-M0S816O3y5g" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;M0S816O3y5g&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M0S816O3y5g?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=47s">00:47</a> – “Is this real?”: Early experiments<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=150s">02:30</a> – A use case that changed everything<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=258s">04:18</a> – Surprises in early bitcoin mining<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=344s">05:44</a> – First consumer business <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=530s">08:50</a> — Embedding throughout Fidelity<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=600s">10:00</a> – Responding to the regulatory freeze<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=799s">13:19</a> – Stablecoin then and now <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1019s">16:59</a> – Build vs. buy<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1220s">20:20</a> – How to operationalize the new <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1452s">24:12</a> – Replace vs. rebuild financial system?<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1706s">28:26</a> – Thoughts on bitcoin <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1817s">30:17</a> – Handling skepticism, “religious wars”<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=1950s">32:30</a> – Innovation vs. inertia, taking risks  <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0S816O3y5g&amp;t=2047s">34:07</a> – The future of crypto x TradFi</p><div><hr></div><h5>THE ARGUMENT</h5><h2>Quantum computing and blockchains: Let’s match the urgency to the actual threats</h2><p><em>Justin Thaler</em></p><p>Timelines to a cryptographically relevant quantum computer are frequently overstated in press releases, media, and elsewhere — leading to calls for urgent, wholesale transitions to post-quantum cryptography. </p><p>But these calls often ignore the costs and risks of premature migration, and also overlook more salient security issues (like bugs).</p><p>So in this piece, Thaler clarifies common misconceptions about quantum threats to cryptography — covering encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs — with a special focus on implications for blockchains.
