Today we have Josh’s analysis of today’s “global authoritarian movement” of Trump, Musk, MBS, petro‑states, and a right‑curious billionaire class whoh together form an Authoritarian International whose natural habitat is our current, parasocial, rage‑bait internet, which is a tool they hope to use to castrate democracy as we have known it, and transform liberal democratic capitalism into a very strange authoritarian oligarchical collectivism powered by its use of the information-warfare brain-hacking tools that are part of our Attention Info-Bio Tech mode of production…</h6><div><hr></div><p>I hope first-generation internet stalwart Josh Marshall and his TPM “Talking Points Memo” team &lt;http://talkingpointsmemo.com&gt; won’t be <em>too</em> mad at me for crossposting this, and thus pulling it out from behind his paywall of TPM members.

But today I want to make an ask: In our current situation, the same wetware that evolved for a roving band of 150 East African Plains Ape souls on the veldt is now thrown into a billion‑person feed curated by authoritarian‑curious plutocrat-oligarchs. So please to something to slightly unkew our mediasphere of public reason.
