        <p>Up to now, <em>We Have Never Been Woke</em> has been a smashing <a href="https://musaalgharbi.substack.com/p/critics-respond-to-we-have-never">critical success</a>. It’s also been commercially successful. It missed some of the bestseller lists because those are determined by first week sales and, in my case, the book had a decent but not gangbuster first week but then built rapidly —seeing a growth curve that’s starting to look exponential (even as most other successful titles have strong first-week sales and then rapidly drop off). All good things. </p><p>To everyone who picked up a copy of the book for themselves or even bought multiple copies to give them to others, thank you so much! Info on how to buy the book from your preferred vendor and your preferred format is <a href="https://musaalgharbi.com/paperback-edition-we-have-never-been-woke/">here</a>.  </p><p>For those who’ve already invested in a copy, I hope you find the book to be accessible, compelling and insightful. So far, the feedback from readers in comments and emails has been very warm.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:180303,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n4Lg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F740e7964-3717-4b46-be95-8d0ba1b63867_2016x1512.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Thanks to reader Caitlin S., who shared this image of my book “in the wild” </figcaption></figure></div><p>Ultimately, as a scholar, my primary concern is not necessarily to maximize profits — it’s to have as many people as possible read and engage with the book and its content. On <em>that</em> front, there are several ways that you (yes, you!) can help expand access and interest for <em>We Have Never Been Woke </em>to those who don’t yet have a copy. This post will walk through some options. Most of the suggestions just take a few minutes and cost nothing. However, at scale they can make a <em>very</em> big difference in enhancing the impact and reach of the book.</p><h2>Request <em>We Have Never Been Woke</em> for your local public library</h2><p>Public libraries are great places where people of all ages and from many walks of life end up gathered together. Books available at public libraries can reach many constituencies that I might not otherwise interact with through other means.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </p><p>Most contemporary public libraries have websites allowing you to search their existing catalog – and if they don’t yet have a particular book, but folks in the community <em>want</em> the library to have that book, there’s usually a quick form that can be filled out to request that a text be added to the collection. Librarians are often quite responsive to these requests.</p><p>To illustrate what the process looks like: the closest public library to me </p>...</source>
