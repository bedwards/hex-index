My restaurant became a volunteer run aid distribution center - one of hundreds of grass roots efforts across the country that sprang up and gave Moldova the name “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nicQGPC5K5I">A Small Country With a Big Heart</a>.” </p><p>As you all know, this small country has come under unrelenting pressure in the last year as Russia’s hybrid attacks against Moldova’s democracy pushed the country to the brink.

This situation is only getting worse - for many critical organizations this election may have been their last rodeo. </p><p>The European Union has stepped into the gap left by USAID, but there is only so much that they can do. There are still gaps, and it is more important than ever to fill them. </p><p>So today, I’m announcing that I’ve co-founded a new US based 501c3 non-profit called the <strong><a href="https://www.moldovaresilience.org">Moldova Resilience Fund</a></strong>. In this email I’m going to share a bit about our new organization and how you can get involved. </p><h2>Introducing the <strong>Moldova Resilience Fund</strong></h2><p>The origins of the Moldova Resilience Fund (MRF) go back to December 2024. The country was still reeling from the razor thin referendum on EU integration, and subsequent Romanian election disaster. We were only beginning to learn </p>...</source>
