          <strong>Luddite</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Kingsnorth explicitly invokes the Luddites as a model for &#039;reactionary radicalism&#039; against the Machine. Understanding the actual historical movement—their craft-based protests, the specific technologies they opposed, and their vision of a &#039;moral economy&#039;—provides essential context for his argument that technology should serve human capability rather than replace it.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The enclosure of the commons is presented as the origin point of Kingsnorth&#039;s &#039;Machine&#039;—the moment when communal land was privatized and peasants lost their &#039;partial independence.&#039; Understanding this historical process in England illuminates his thesis about how people became dependent &#039;hirelings&#039; rather than self-sufficient communities.</p>

          <strong>Ivan Illich</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Illich&#039;s &#039;Tools for Conviviality&#039; as a key framework for evaluating technology—that tools should extend human capability rather than diminish independence. Illich&#039;s broader critique of institutionalization in medicine, education, and transportation deeply informs the anti-Machine philosophy Kingsnorth advocates.</p>
