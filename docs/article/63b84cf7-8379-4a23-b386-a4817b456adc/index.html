        <p>Whenever you see a regulatory agency like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a utility company crow about how much an energy proposal or regulation will save or cost Americans, the first thing you should do is ask: “Oh yeah? Compared to what?”</p><p>It’s important to ask this question because these entities never report the true cost of a proposal compared to today’s costs, but instead, they compare the costs to some imaginary future baseline scenario that is often even more expensive. </p><p>This deceptive bait-and-switch tactic allows utilities and regulatory agencies to hide the true costs of their onerous regulations or integrated resource plans in a B.S. baseline. It also allows these entities to dishonestly claim their preferred policies will save energy consumers money—when in reality, they won’t</p><p>In this week’s episode of <em>Energy Bad Boys, </em>we pull back the curtain on how the EPA used a B.S. Baseline to hide the true (and massive) costs of its regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal and new natural gas power plants.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png" width="936" height="704" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:998877,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://energybadboys.substack.com/i/170388595?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!c_m2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F495961d6-31eb-4dd8-bdef-5d66e9eb00de_936x704.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>What’s the Bait &amp; Switch (B.S.) Tactic?</h1><p>Imagine you were at Best Buy browsing around, and you saw an advertisement for two TVs—the one on the left has a price tag of $800, and the other on the right has a price tag of $500. The sign reads: “Save $300 by choosing the one on the right!”</p><p>Sure, you can save $300 by buying the TV on the right, <em>compared to buying the one on the left, </em>but ultimately, you understand that you’re still spending an extra $500. You could save <em>even more </em>($500) by not buying a new TV in the first place. These are the kinds of bait-and-switch shenanigans used by regulatory agencies and utilities to sell their energy proposals to the public. </p><p>To help understand how this relates to energy modeling, it helps to look at another example involving a government budget.</p><p>Let’s say the federal government currently spends $200 billion per year on government programs, but some lawmakers want to increase spending to $1 trillion to pay for more government programs. Ultimately, Congress agrees to spend a total of $700 billion per year instead of $1 trillion.</p><p>Most people would probably look at this budget and agree that it increases spending by $500 billion per year, but spending advocates would argue that <em>this bill saves $300 billion per year</em>. This is only true </p>...</source>
