      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I just got back to London after a week at the Annual Meeting at Davos. For the past few years, the World Economic Forum had become a kind of parody of itself, a place where billionaires flew in on private jets to discuss climate change and “stakeholder capitalism” while nothing much seemed to happen. But this year was different.</p><p>The AI discussion at the Forum alone was proof of change. It was practical, CEOs asking each other: what’s actually happening with your workforce? Which skills matter now? Why is <em>that</em> company pulling ahead while everyone else flounders? </p><p>And on politics, things moved to the heart of the matter: the fragmentation, the end of the old world order. But neither Davos woman nor Davos man felt a deracination in the face of the crumbling rules-based order. Rather, they used the simple fact that many of those who hold the world’s power were gathered in that one place: to speak and, in many cases, to listen.</p><p>The gathering met, nay exceeded, its purpose. Davos showed why it matters, why it is necessary in a world that is fraying rather than cohering.</p><p>Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, gave a speech that will echo for a long time. He spoke of “the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality.” He was referring to the unraveling of the post-war geopolitical settlement, the fading authority of the rules-based order, the growing irrelevance of multilateral institutions designed for a slower, more stable world. If you haven’t seen it yet, I really recommend watching.</p><div id="youtube2-flsgJe8mN-A" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;flsgJe8mN-A&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/flsgJe8mN-A?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Carney was talking about treaties, trade, and power. But these aren’t the only norms that are unravelling. </p><p>Today’s reflection originates from the research I’m doing for my second book. There’s a long way to go before it lands on your shelf, but that work is already tracing a similar unraveling – in domains much closer to Exponential View’s home. So let’s get to it.</p><h3>The three crossings</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png" width="561" height="561" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:561,&quot;bytes&quot;:1614470,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.exponentialview.co/i/185424800?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LXIs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa42882c3-c698-403f-90af-bde566d8eea9_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">We have crossed the threshold from extraction to learning.
