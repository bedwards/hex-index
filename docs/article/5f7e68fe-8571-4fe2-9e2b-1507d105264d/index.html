For example, are you building on a public chain, focused on growing TVL and users? Or are you an infrastructure provider targeting fintechs who want to embed crypto into their core products? Answers to questions like these will guide your approach.</p><p>To help, we wrote a guide and a set of practical lessons drawn from firsthand experience building in and working closely with founders across the crypto ecosystem.</p><p><strong><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-to-hire-business-development-growth/">read more</a></strong></p><div><hr></div><h2>6 myths about privacy on blockchains</h2><p><em>David Sverdlov and Aiden Slavin</em></p><p>When it comes to concerns about the end of privacy, blockchains are in good company.</p><p>Older technologies — like the telegraph, telephone, and the internet — have all spurred similar concerns… none of which actually came true.

Neither is true.</p><p>But the real challenge isn’t about choosing between privacy and security. It’s about building tools — technical and legal — that support both. Blockchains are already on this path. From zero-knowledge proof systems to advanced cryptography, privacy-preserving solutions are scaling. As our readers know, far from being just about finance, blockchain privacy opens doors for identity verification, AI, and more applications that benefit users.</p><p>To address some of the misconceptions around privacy on blockchains, we cover 6 of the most pernicious myths, starting with…</p><p><strong>Myth:</strong> <strong>The internet works fine without privacy</strong></p><p>Reality: A lack of privacy in the early internet impeded widespread adoption. In general, people had higher degrees of privacy before the internet.</p><p><strong>Myth: Public blockchain transactions are anonymous</strong></p><p>Reality: Not true!
