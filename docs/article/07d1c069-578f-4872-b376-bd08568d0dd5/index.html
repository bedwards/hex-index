        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to m</em>e.</p><h3>3,000 kg pallet transport AMR</h3><p>Swisslog, a provider of warehouse automation and software, expanded its portfolio by introducing the IntraMove series of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). IntraMove AMRs provide a versatile, horizontal transportation for payloads up to 3,000 kg (6,613 lb). IntraMove is connected to the AI-based fleet management software via the VDA 5050 standard communication interface. These robots are available in different payload versions — 600 kg, 1,500 kg, and 3,000 kg. It can be directly linked to a WCS or WMS, such as the company’s SynQ software, which manages the transport orders.

It’s an autonomous vehicle with 10 refrigerated lockers the size of a shuttle bus. It does not require a driver and can carry up to 500 pounds of payload for multiple deliveries. The fully electric vehicle has a range of 112 miles, a maximum speed of 25 mph, and a curb weight of 2,205 pounds. This is a considerable improvement in deliverable mass compared to drones or sidewalk boxes, but at this point, I fear we’re just reinventing food trucks.

The Series B funding will enable the company to hire new talent, develop innovative products, and expand into additional enterprise deployments. Launched 18 months ago, the company has more than 70 enterprise customers, including DHL, Ryder, Schneider, and Werner, which use HappyRobot for tasks such as appointment scheduling, collections, and outbound sales. HappyRobot’s AI operating system combines “real-time truth,” specialized AI workers, and an orchestrating intelligence to manage “complex, mission-critical work,” starting with supply chain and industrial-scale operations. [<a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2025/happyrobot-raises-44-million-dollars-ai-supply-chain-workers/">Pymnts</a>]</p><h3>4.8 million TEU annual capacity</h3><p>Ceremonies in Mumbai on September 4th marked the completion of Phase 2 of the JN Port-PSA Mumbai Terminal's expansion, which doubled its capacity and made it the largest container terminal in the country. The Mumbai terminal, which spans 200 hectares, has doubled its annual handling capacity to ...</p>
