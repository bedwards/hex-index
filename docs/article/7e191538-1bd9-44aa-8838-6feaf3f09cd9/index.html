      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>For the last decade, the quest for longevity has been framed as a Silicon Valley moonshot, driven by tech billionaires and biotech startups. But recent events signal a fundamental shift. The quiet dialogue between Eastern leaders like Putin and Xi on life extension, combined with immense demographic pressures, is moving longevity from the lab into the halls of national strategy. Data shows Asia currently represents only 10% of longevity companies, highlighting the West's dominant head start. However, the motivations driving the East are urgent and existential. This isn't just a biotech race anymore; it's a geopolitical competition, and the outcome could redefine global power for the next century.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The BRICS Strategy: A State-Mandated Quest for Survival</strong></h2><p>For nations like China, India, and Russia, the pursuit of longevity is less a luxury and more a strategic imperative. Their approach is top-down, driven by national priorities and long-term state planning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>China's Demographic Imperative:</strong> China faces a demographic crisis from its former one-child policy. With a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce, extending the healthspan of its citizens is a matter of economic survival. Projections show its old-age dependency ratio is set to triple by 2060, making a productive, longer-living populace an urgent national goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>India's Strategic Crossroads:</strong> As the "pharmacy of the world," India's massive pharmaceutical industry (over $50 billion in 2023) gives it a powerful starting position. However, with the US and China making biotech a matter of national strategy, China even overhauled its regulatory system in 2018 to accelerate advanced medicine, manufacturing alone won't be enough.</p><ul><li><p>If India wants a real seat at the table, it must move beyond production and foster an environment where its world-class scientific talent and huge domestic market can drive innovation. Initiatives like <strong><a href="https://giftgujarat.in/">GIFT City</a></strong> hint at this ambition, but the real test will be cutting through bureaucratic hurdles to invest deeply in R&amp;D. If it succeeds, India could shape the longevity space.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Russia's National Security Angle:</strong> For Russia, a declining population is a direct threat to its geopolitical ambitions. Extending the health and capability of its leadership, military, and key personnel is a logical, if unspoken, strategic objective to project power and ensure stability.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Western Strategy: A Market-Driven Push to Stay on Top</strong></h2><p>The US and Europe are reacting from their position as the incumbent leaders, driven by the world's most powerful market-based innovation ecosystem.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Innovation Engine:</strong> The West is home </p></li>...</ul>
