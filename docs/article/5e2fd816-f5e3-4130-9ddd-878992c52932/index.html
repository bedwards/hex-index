Officially, such choreography signals institutional health, transparency as proof of vitality. The release of the Epstein files has been presented in precisely these terms: Congress mandated disclosure; the Department of Justice complied; a statutory clock was observed. Yet what occurred in practice was not a single act of disclosure but a staggered unveiling. By the 19 December 2025 deadline, barely one percent of the files had been made public, with further batches released in waves thereafter. The effect was less cathartic revelation than serialized exposure—a drip-feed of scandal that kept outrage alive while deferring any real confrontation or resolution.</p><p>This teasing temporality inevitably provoked suspicion: critics pointed to political timing, media management, and strategic calibration of attention. But beyond questions of motive lies something more symptomatic. The carefully calibrated procedure resembles the cultural logic it purports to expose. What we witness is not bureaucratic caution but a system that sustains itself also through managed scandal, prolonging the spectacle of corruption as a substitute for structural renewal. In this sense, the staggered release matters much less as an administrative failure than as an index of a civilisation that has learned how to decline while simulating a long-expired vitality.</p><p>We live in a time of severe socio-economic contraction and corresponding spiritual anomie, where the system’s reproductive fatigue generates a plethora of what Antonio Gramsci called “morbid symptoms”: phenomena that do not herald transformation but function to mask societal decay. Libidinal investment in such phenomena tends to deepen subjugation, as moral outrage becomes emotional attachment while collective misery is reproduced through the very spectacles that appear to expose it. The Epstein files belong to this morbid landscape, not because they are unimportant, but because they dramatize and conceal systemic decline in one fell swoop.</p><p>The first point to stress is that these are not just “Epstein files,” but the archival trace of a civilisation that has systematically reproduced itself through organised forms of violence. Capitalism and sexual abuse are driven by the same predatory logic: the capacity to dehumanize others and exploit vulnerability for profit. Within such a system, the traits that make someone a </p>...</source>
