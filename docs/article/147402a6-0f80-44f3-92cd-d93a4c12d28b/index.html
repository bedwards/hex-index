In the days since, it has become the most-discussed interview we've done in three years on the show. Listeners who wrote in to us said they were shocked to hear the leader of a platform with 151.5 million monthly users, most of them minors, express frustration and annoyance at being asked about the company's history of failures related to child safety. Journalists described the interview as "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMidkFVX3lxTE4xNlk2SVc0YWJhRXF1Z2NUa1RJZFhRYzhCclk3Z2d2VFVkY2JsQUVIa1A4QUJJSGlFcnIwYjFNZ2hEV3JaMG4ycWxvX2YyMlpJeEVOaGhDLWZyamRGWS03MFEwalB0cDRtLU5uM3FFRnNaUjRpS2c?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">bizarre</a>," "<a href="https://news.google.com/read/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxOTUlxUlVyeFhrRk9XSDd1enBzcmVnbm9uVFVoOGlnUUdLcE9VT291SndCT0RVUlY2ZmJMOFh5bG9lZ2VpVDQ3WkFhMTFXcTJTaUhxTjd2b2NrT0lFeWlLeUxiUEd3Sk1yeEgwYTlTcG1PdnAtNnlBNHdYV1lEejYtODU5RlZUa1Z6VzJrcnFXeGtTbGpQR2hIRXRqcWZzMGhpTzRnVlNsaERmcmxBZWcwdEtJejRfVkhQYUdTQmZNUl9PdEVKUUZkVHBfT3RXUFRUMURIc0ZiZ20zLVY4Z3ZfNENKaw?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">unhinged</a>," and a "<a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-new-york-times-interview-baszucki-2000646174?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">car crash</a>." </p><p>And a case can be made that it was all of those things — even if Baszucki, in the studio afterwards and <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1991944434330800427?s=20&amp;ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">later on X</a>, insisted to us that he had had a good time. In the moment, though, Baszucki's dismissive attitude toward discussing child safety struck me as something worse: familiar.</p><p>Baszucki, after all, is not the first CEO to have insisted to me that a platform's problems are smaller than I am making them out to be. Nor is he the first to blame the platform's enormous scale, or to try to change the subject. (He is the first tech CEO to suggest to me that maybe there should be prediction markets in video games for children, but that's another story.)</p><p>What people found noteworthy about our interview, I think, was the fresh evidence that our most successful tech CEOs really do think and talk this way. Given a chance to display empathy for the victims of crimes his platform enabled, or to convey regret about historical safety lapses, or even just to gesture at some sense of responsibility for the hundreds of millions of children who in various ways are depending on him, the CEO throws up his hands and asks: how long are you guys going to be going on about all this stuff? </p><p>Roblox is different from other social products in that it explicitly courts users as young as 5. (You are supposed to be at least 13 to use Instagram, TikTok, and other major platforms.) That has always put significant pressure on the company to develop serious safety features. The company <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/tr/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users?ref=platformer.news" rel="noreferrer">says</a> it spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on safety, and that 10 percent of its employees work on trust and safety issues. And trust and safety workers I know tell me that they respect Roblox's ...</p>
