Let us discuss something that has the potential to be a more productive use of time, for those of us who want to make some progress in the class war, before we all die of old age. </p><p>For many decades, the labor movement has debated the utility of forming its own political party— a Labor Party. I have <a href="https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/do-we-need-a-labor-party">written about this debate</a> before. The short version of what I wrote was: On the national level, and in particular concerning presidential elections, forming a third party tends to be counterproductive, because it has the effect of pulling votes away from the party <em>closest</em> to your beliefs and thereby helping the party most opposed to your own beliefs. If organized labor or anyone else wants to form an effective third party on the national level, they must first tackle the underlying issue of our winner-take-all electoral system. They must fight for proportional representation, a thing that does in fact exist in more enlightened democracies than ours. With proportional representation, a third party can operate effectively in national elections without simply sucking votes away from the party closest to it and helping its enemies. Want a Labor Party that can run a righteous presidential candidate? Great. Say your plan for achieving proportional representation. Until then, it is probably more effective in the real world to focus on pulling the Democrats left. </p><p>However! There are other places, on the state and local levels, where a Labor Party or something similar, could be effective. That’s what I want to talk about today. </p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>Think about Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York mayor’s race. It established DSA as a legitimate electoral political force. How did DSA help defeat the power of organized money? By using organized people. The campaign claimed more than <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2025/11/14/zohran_campaign">100,000</a> total volunteers, who knocked on many hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/09/30/mamdani-canvass-canarsie-cuomo-mayor-election/">doors</a> across the city. There were other factors—a charismatic candidate running against a bunch </p>...</source>
