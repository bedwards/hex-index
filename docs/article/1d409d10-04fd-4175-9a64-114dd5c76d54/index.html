        <p><em>Hi, I’m Maud. My passion for understanding and exploring the evolving landscape of health and wellness has led me to create this newsletter. Each week, I'll dive deep into the latest trends in longevity and functional health, uncovering exciting developments in both science and business, and sharing practical tips. Subscribe and never miss an issue!</em></p><p>Last week, I had the privilege of going on stage at the <a href="https://www.aiforlife.artefact.com/">AI for Life conference in Switzerland</a> to discuss a growing trend that is reshaping the healthcare landscape: preventative health powered by an explosion of health data. The shift from traditional, reactive healthcare to proactive, data-driven wellness is not just a concept; it is becoming a tangible reality, as demonstrated by visionaries like Bryan Johnson.</p><p>In this article, I'll share insights from my conference presentation (slides available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1adrXBycdxDzd0ymXDTXuuvwfSjapuNEhUI3587fZNJ8/edit#slide=id.g2a1c7154e31_0_58">here</a>) and explore this emerging healthcare era. We'll delve into the crucial role of continuous data monitoring in enabling personalized, proactive health management, marking a significant shift in how we approach health and wellness.</p><h3><strong>The Most Measured Man in History: A Tale</strong></h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Bryan Johnson, Anti-Aging Tech Millionaire, Says He's Not 'Dracula'&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Bryan Johnson, Anti-Aging Tech Millionaire, Says He's Not 'Dracula'" title="Bryan Johnson, Anti-Aging Tech Millionaire, Says He's Not 'Dracula'" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uwaE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F301938c6-338f-4791-9c9f-fc12480d39f3_1800x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The internet is not short of opinions about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bryanjohnson_/?hl=en">Bryan Johnson</a>, the tech entrepreneur waging a one-man war against aging who founded the Longevity protocole <a href="https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co/">Blueprint</a>.

He reportedly spends $2M/year on his health - more than any of the world’s top athletes like Lebron James.</p><blockquote><p><em>Algorithms understand and can guide me better than I can guide myself. The real game-changer is data. Without it, algorithms couldn’t function effectively. While the algorithms have always been there, they lacked the essential fuel of data.
