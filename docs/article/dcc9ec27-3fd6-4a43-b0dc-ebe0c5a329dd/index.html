          <strong>Seamus Heaney</strong>
          <span class="read-time">17 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Heaney is central to the article&#039;s argument about poetry as redress. Readers would benefit from understanding his full biography, his Nobel Prize work, and his early teaching career in Belfast during The Troubles that shaped his views on poetry&#039;s social role.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Heaney teaching Catholic boys in Belfast during &#039;tumultuous political conflict&#039; in the 1960s. Understanding the sectarian violence and political context of Northern Ireland illuminates why Heaney developed his theory of poetry as counterbalance to harsh reality.</p>

          <strong>W. B. Yeats</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Yeats is a key figure in the article, discussed in Heaney&#039;s Oxford lecture comparing attitudes toward death in poetry. Understanding Yeats&#039;s mysticism, Irish nationalism, and poetic philosophy provides essential context for the article&#039;s exploration of transformative versus cynical worldviews.</p>
