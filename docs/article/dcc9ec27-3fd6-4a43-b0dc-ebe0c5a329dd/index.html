          <strong>Seamus Heaney</strong>
          <span class="read-time">17 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Heaney is central to the article&#039;s argument about poetry as redress. Readers would benefit from understanding his full biography, his Nobel Prize work, and his early teaching career in Belfast during The Troubles that shaped his views on poetry&#039;s social role.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Heaney teaching Catholic boys in Belfast during &#039;tumultuous political conflict&#039; in the 1960s. Understanding the sectarian violence and political context of Northern Ireland illuminates why Heaney developed his theory of poetry as counterbalance to harsh reality.</p>

          <strong>W. B. Yeats</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Yeats is a key figure in the article, discussed in Heaney&#039;s Oxford lecture comparing attitudes toward death in poetry. Understanding Yeats&#039;s mysticism, Irish nationalism, and poetic philosophy provides essential context for the article&#039;s exploration of transformative versus cynical worldviews.</p>

There is an initial rush of creativity as you set up your classroom, create seating charts, and organize new school supplies. The first days of school are happily exhausting, similar to a runner’s high after a race. </p><p>As the year progresses, outside stressors accumulate: meetings, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/exhaustion-by-1000-paper-cuts?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">paperwork</a>, sickness, missed lunches to cover another class, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/opting-out?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">testing</a>, more meetings, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/recalcitrance-in-my-classroom?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">shortened planning time to make a parent phone call</a>, mandated initiatives, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/the-measure-of-a-teacher?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">teacher evaluations</a>, more testing. Veteran teachers understand that these things just come with the job. Many of are outside of our control; we take the hits as best as we can, and continue to teach. </p><p>Experience has taught me that the more I fill my classroom with things I love: <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/the-socratic-readers-guild?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">book clubs</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/creating-community?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">building classroom culture</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/by-heart?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">poetry recitations</a>, music, critical thinking, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/the-choreography-of-my-classroom?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">flow states</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/my-thinking-classroom?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">deep mathematical thinking</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/levity?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">laughter</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/philosophia?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">creative learning experiences</a>, <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/poetry-masterclass?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">poetry</a>, classroom discussions, and <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/ripples-to-create-change?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">connections</a>, the easier it is for me to bear the drudgeries.</p><p>And so, throughout the year, the balance shifts from banalities to brightness. I’ve learned in my career how to navigate the heaviness of teaching and <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/adrianneibauer/p/teach-the-students-you-have?r=gtvg8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">amplify the good</a>. When I let the have-to’s outweigh the get-to’s, teaching is more difficult. My naturally curious and optimistic attitude slowly erodes away leaving cynicism and stagnation. Some weeks, teaching feels light and full of possibility. Other times, it feels heavy and hopeless. The countless meetings, trainings, fundraising, interruptions, and testing all make it easy to lose sight of the intended, aspirational ethos of teaching and learning.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>In order that human beings bring about the most radiant conditions for themselves to inhabit, it is essential that the vision of reality which poetry offers should be transformative, more than just a printout of the given circumstances of its time and place. The poet who would be most the poet has to attempt an act of writing that outstrips the conditions even as it observes them.</p><p>From "Joy Or Night: Last Things in the Poetry of W. B.
