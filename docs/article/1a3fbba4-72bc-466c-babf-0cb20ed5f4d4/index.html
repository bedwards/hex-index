        <h3>“Science makes people reach selflessly for truth and objectivity; it teaches people to accept reality, with wonder and admiration, not to mention the deep joy and awe that the natural order of things brings to the true scientist.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>In the fall of 1946, a South African little girl aspiring to be a scientist <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/04/09/dear-professor-einstein-girl/">wrote to Einstein</a> and ended her letter with a self-conscious entreatment: <em>“I hope you will not think any the less of me for being a girl!”</em> Einstein responded with words of assuring wisdom that resonate to this day: <em>“I do not mind that you are a girl, but the main thing is that you yourself do not mind. There is no reason for it.”</em></p>
<p>And yet reasons don’t always come from reason. The history of science, like the history of the world itself, is the history of unreasonable asymmetries of power, the suppressive consequences of which have meant that the <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/07/28/women-in-science-rachel-ignotofsky/">comparatively few women</a> who rose to the top of their respective field did so due to inordinate brilliance and tenacity. </p>
<p>Among the most outstanding yet under-celebrated of these pioneering women is the Austrian physicist <strong>Lise Meitner</strong> (November 7, 1878–October 27, 1968), who led the team that discovered nuclear fission but was excluded from the Nobel Prize for the discovery, and whose story I first encountered in Alan Lightman’s illuminating 1990 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Discoveries-Breakthroughs-20th-century-Including-Original/dp/0375421688/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><em>The Discoveries</em></a>. This diminutive Jewish woman, who had barely saved her own life from the Nazis, was heralded by Einstein as the Marie Curie of the German-speaking world. She is the subject of the excellent biography <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lise-Meitner-Ruth-Lewin-Sime/dp/0520208609/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Lise Meitner: A Life in Physics</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/lise-meitner-a-life-in-physics/oclc/32893857&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) by chemist, science historian, and Guggenheim fellow Ruth Lewin Sime. </p>

<p>Meitner was born in Vienna a little more than a year after pioneering astronomer Maria Mitchell, who <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/22/maria-mitchell-education-women-in-science/">paved the way for women in science</a> across the Atlantic, admonished the first class of female astronomers: <em>“No woman should say, ‘I am but a woman!’ But a woman! What more can you ask to be?”</em> Although Meitner showed a gift for mathematics from an early age, there was little correlation between aptitude and opportunity for women in 19th-century Europe. At the end of her long life, she would recount, not bitterly but wistfully:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thinking back to … the time of my youth, one realizes with some astonishment how many problems then existed in the lives of ordinary young </p>...</blockquote>
