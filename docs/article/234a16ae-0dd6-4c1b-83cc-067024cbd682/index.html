Adaptation also occurs at multiple levels within military institutions. It occurs before and during wars, and as I wrote in this recent article, it occurs in the short period between peace and war. Adaptation also happens in corporate organisations that are lined to military institutions. Finally, adaptation takes place within enemy organisations as well as within allies.</p><p>Adaptation was at the front of my mind during my time in southern Ukraine this week, when I visited Ukrainian units in Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and eastern Ukraine. And the key organisation I was privileged to visit was the newly established organisation known as the Directorate of Assault Units.</p><p>In this update, I will cover the rationale for the establishment of this new organisation, its commander, as well as its structure and concept of operations.</p><h3><strong>Why the Directorate of Assault Units?</strong></h3><p>This new command, which may in the near future be renamed the Command of Assault Troops, was established in August 2025 by the Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief, General Syrskyi.
