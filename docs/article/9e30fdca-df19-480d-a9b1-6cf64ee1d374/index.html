          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically references Direct Instruction as a research-grounded approach that was rejected despite outperforming other models in large-scale studies. Understanding this specific pedagogical method and its history would give readers crucial context for the debate about evidence-based teaching.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article cites learning styles as a prime example of an &#039;edu-fad&#039; that persists despite decades of research showing no benefits. A deep dive into this debunked theory and why it remains popular would illuminate the article&#039;s core argument about belief-based versus science-based education.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article envisions a future where &#039;every teacher would understand how cognitive load affects learning&#039; as part of science-informed teaching. This specific cognitive science concept is central to evidence-based instructional design and directly supports the article&#039;s thesis.</p>
