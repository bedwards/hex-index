        <p>This post may be less solicitous of your feelings than you may hope.</p><p>America faces many problems.  The easy ones we solve or ignore.  We struggle with the hard ones.  Hard problems raise complex questions that lack glib, one-word answers.  The stubborn thirst for simple answers to hard questions is bad for America.  It’s anti-intellectual, pro-ignorance, pro-stupidity, pro-bigotry, pro-reactionary, pro-totalitarianism, pro-tyranny, pro-mob.  </p><p>Take this week’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/05/college-presidents-testifying-campus-antisemitism-00130277">Congressional hearing about antisemitism on college campuses</a>, titled “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism.”  A generous interpretation — a credulous one — would be that the hearing was designed to inquire why colleges aren’t protecting Jewish students from antisemitic harassment.  A more realistic interpretation is that the hearing was a crass show trial primarily intended to convey that a wide variety of dissenting speech about Israel is inherently antisemitic, that American colleges are shitholes of evil liberalism, and that Democrats suck.  Since Democrats <em>do</em> suck, they <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/06/democrats-harvard-mit-upenn-stefanik-00130471">mostly cooperated</a>.</p><p>The core Two-Minute Hate of this carnival was Rep. Elise Stefanik’s demand for yes-or-no answers to questions about whether policies at Harvard, Penn, and MIT would prohibit calling for the genocide of Jews.  You might think Elise Stefanik is an unlikely standard-bearer for a crusade against antisemitism, given that she’s a repeat promoter of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elise-stefanik-great-replacement-buffalo-shooter-1354054/">Great Replacement Theory,</a> the antisemitic trope that Jews are bringing foreigners into America to undermine it.  But if you bought Stefanik’s bullshit, you probably didn’t think that far.  The college presidents did a rather clumsy job of saying, accurately but unconvincingly, that the answer depends on the context.  Stefanik and every politician our loudmouth who wants you to hate and distrust college education and Palestinians <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/12/06/billionaire-ackman-calls-on-harvard-mit-penn-presidents-to-resign-in-disgrace-musk-republicans-pile-on/?sh=19140cc3c2b5">pounced on it</a>.  And many of you fell for it.  You — and I say this with love — absolute fucking dupes.</p><p>If you think the question “is calling for the genocide of a group against your policy” is an easy question with a one-word answer, you’re wrong.  I understand you want the answer to be easy, but that’s not the same thing as it being easy.  </p><p>Even though private colleges aren’t bound by the First Amendment, let’s first look at it as a First Amendment question, as the outer limits of what’s permitted.  Is calling for the genocide of a group protected by the First Amendment?  In America, the answer is yes, unless it also falls into an established First Amendment exception.  The ...</p>
