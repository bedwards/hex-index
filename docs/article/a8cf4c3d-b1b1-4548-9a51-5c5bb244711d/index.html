What is currently happening to them? And what are their prospects for the future?</p><p><em>The Pillar</em> takes a look.</p><h3><strong>What’s the context?</strong></h3><p>Cambodia is a Southeast Asian nation of around 18 million people that borders Laos, Vietnam, and, of course, Thailand. The population is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Cambodia">97%</a> Buddhist, mainly following the Theravada school, which predates the larger but newer Mahayana school. Buddhism is the state religion.</p><p>A 2019 census found that just 0.3% of Cambodians are Christian. Estimates of the number of Catholics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_Cambodia#Statistics_and_jurisdiction">vary</a> widely, from around <a href="https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/country/sckh1.html">20,000</a> to 75,000.</p><p>The Catholic presence in Cambodia dates back to the 16th century, when the Dominican missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaspar_da_Cruz">Fr. Gaspar da Cruz</a> arrived from Portugal. He made little headway with the local population, as did his successors, even when Cambodia was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_protectorate_of_Cambodia">French protectorate</a> from 1863 to 1953. The first Cambodian priest was only ordained in 1957.</p><p>Catholics were driven underground when the communist Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975, led by dictator Pol Pot. Many died in labor camps, including <a href="https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bsalas.html">Bishop Joseph Chhmar Salas</a>, the Vicar Apostolic of Phnom Penh, whose beatification cause <a href="https://zenit.org/2020/05/22/memory-of-victims-of-khmer-rouge-a-time-to-remember-cambodian-martyrs/">opened</a> in 2015. Others, such as the priest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tep_Im_Sotha">Paul Tep Im Sotha</a>, were summarily executed.</p><p>That Cambodia is still something of a mission territory is indicated by the absence of any dioceses. There are only three jurisdictions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Vicariate_of_Phnom_Penh">Apostolic Vicariate of Phnom Penh</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Prefecture_of_Kampong_Cham">Apostolic Prefecture of Kampong Cham</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Prefecture_of_Battambang">Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang</a>.</p><p>The Apostolic Prefecture of Battambang, which runs along the Thai border, covers around 30,000 square miles — a territory roughly the size of Scotland — but serves <a href="https://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbatt.html">fewer than 6,000</a> Catholics.</p><p>Thailand, a country of around 71 million people bordering Laos, Malaysia, and Myanmar as well as Cambodia, is approximately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Thailand">93%</a> Buddhist, largely also of the Theravada school. Christianity accounts for little more than 1% of the population.</p><p>There are fewer than 400,000 Catholics, who can also trace their history back to a 16th-century mission, led in this case by a French Franciscan called Bonferre. He was no more successful than Cruz in Cambodia. But later missionaries persevered, despite often sharp </p>...</source>
