        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to m</em>e.</p><h3>18-day trip from China to Europe</h3><p>A Chinese Panamax container ship has crossed the Northern Sea Route — which runs along the north coast of Russia, connecting East Asia to Northern Europe — in merely 6 days, a significantly faster Europe-Asia shipping route. The ship departed St. Petersburg on August 18 and arrived in Qingdao on September 12, covering a 25-day voyage. The new Arctic Express opened this month, connecting China to Europe via an 18-day trip that is considerably faster than the typical 40- to 50-day Suez Canal route.

Over 130 trains became stranded, and supply chains for e-commerce platforms and manufacturers experienced delays. Logistics firms attempted to use alternatives, such as “Hamburg Special” routes through sea-rail connections via St. Petersburg, or southern corridors through the Black Sea and Turkey; however, these routes incurred higher costs — an additional $800 to $2,000 per 40-foot container compared to the original land route. By September 25, Poland announced that it would reopen the border crossings; however, lingering congestion and instability persisted while backlogs were cleared, and uncertainty remains regarding the reliability of the rail corridor.

The owner of the Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, and Hillshire brands is the latest company to change recipes as the Trump administration aims to restrict ingredients in processed foods. Mills across the U.S. grind up corn to produce roughly 7 million tons of high-fructose corn syrup annually. About 3% of American corn production goes toward making corn syrup for food and drinks, according to federal data. The Corn Refiners Association has defended its safety and stated that eliminating it in food and beverage products would harm U.S. farmers, resulting in a 34-cent-per-bushel decrease in corn prices.
