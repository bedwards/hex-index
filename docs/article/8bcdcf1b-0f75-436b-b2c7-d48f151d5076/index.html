        <p>One frequent theme I often write about is emerging countries’ dependence on fossil fuel exports. This past week, I had the pleasure of visiting Mongolia to study the country’s coal industry.</p><p>Mongolia is an interesting case study because its primary export market for coal is the world’s top electrostate, China. With a population of around 1.4 billion people, there are about 400 Chinese people for every Mongolian. What is more, Mongolia’s other neighbor, Russia, has abundant natural resources. Mongolia exports less than 1% to Russia.</p><p>For Mongolia, economic dependence on coal exports to China presents a difficult challenge. As China continues to expand renewables and coal demand peaks, Mongolia will find itself struggling to replace coal export income.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png" width="936" height="702" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:702,&quot;width&quot;:936,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:879000,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://energyprof.substack.com/i/168829032?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OGZF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc05d5d7d-8c43-4e3f-9679-c25b0a3194f5_936x702.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Mongolia is a vast, landlocked country with the lowest population density in the world. Professor Johannes’s visit in July 2025.</strong></p><p>1. Coal in Mongolia</p><p>Coal is critical to Mongolia’s economy. In 2024, Mongolia produced a <a href="https://www.mysteel.net/news/5077019-mongolian-coal-output-jumps-20-yoy-in-2024">total of 98 million tons</a> of coal. While some of the coal is used for domestic purposes, coal exports are an important source of export revenue. In 2024, Mongolia <a href="https://thecoalhub.com/report-presentation/focus-on-mongolian-coal-exports">exported</a> 84 million tons of coal, worth USD 8.6 billion.</p><p>Replacing coal exports would be hard for Mongolia. Mongolia’s total GDP was only USD 25.8 billion (current prices) in 2024. That means the coal exports were worth one-third of Mongolia’s GDP. Coal was also worth more than <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/profile/MNG">one-half of all exports</a>, which stood at USD 15.8 billion in 2024.</p><p>Considering the data, it is not an exaggeration to say that Mongolia’s economy is built on coal exports. Without coal exports, the country’s economy would face a contraction and a deep recession.</p><p>2. Dependence on China</p><p>Mongolia’s economic dependence on coal exports is further compounded by their concentration in China. Mongolia exports 90% of its coal to neighboring China. Most of the exported coal is high-quality, metallurgical coal used in steelmaking.</p><p>The reason for this concentration is simple. Mongolia is a vast but sparsely populated and landlocked country. It has only two neighbors, Russia and China. Of the two, Russia is a major coal exporter and only imports tiny quantities of high-grade coking coal, anthracite, and other specialized products. That leaves China as the far more plausible import market.</p><p>This dependence is a problem because the outlook for coal demand in China is weak. China has made massive investments in renewable energy to reduce its dependence on polluting </p>...</source>
