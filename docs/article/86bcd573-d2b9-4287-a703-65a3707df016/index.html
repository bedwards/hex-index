        <p><em>“Meta’s goal is to get users to spend as much time on its apps as possible, and it tunes its algorithms to show users the content they most want to see.” - Judge James ‘Jeb’ Boasberg</em></p><p>The most telling moment of a long-running Facebook antitrust case occurred in May, when it came out in the courtroom that the company’s algorithm had <a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/p/instagrams-algorithm-recommended">recommended</a> millions of children’s Instagram accounts to a set of users it internally called “groomers.” One would think that a public expose of Mark Zuckerberg potentially facilitating pedophilia on a mass scale would have become a scandal, discussed by QAnon and a public obsessed with the Epstein files. But it didn’t. A few outlets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-06/instagram-urged-groomers-to-connect-with-minors-ftc-says">reported</a> it. And the judge in the case, James “Jeb” Boasberg, an Obama appointee in the D.C. district court, far from finding something of interest, was annoyed and bored by the revelation. Boasberg told the government to move along and stop wasting his time with such trivialities.</p><p>After years of anger at the social media company, no one, it seemed, cared anymore, even about pretty appalling stuff.</p><p>So it wasn’t a surprise that a few days ago, Boasberg <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921/gov.uscourts.dcd.224921.693.0_2.pdf">ruled</a> for Meta and against the Federal Trade Commission in the case. This ruling didn’t make much of a ripple in the press, or even the antitrust-focused world. I focus on the problem of market power, Meta once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/facebook-definers-soros.html">hired</a> opposition researchers to go after my group personally, and even I had a hard time caring that much. </p><p>Why the apathy? To answer that question, you have to look to another event that happened that same day Boasberg handed down his ruling. President Donald Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/newsletters/5612016-trump-calls-on-congress-to-rein-in-state-ai-regulations/">called</a> for Congress to ban all AI regulation by states, which would clear the way for large tech firms such as Meta to organize huge swaths of American life unencumbered by public rules. He is going to try to insert this provision in an upcoming defense bill, and potentially in executive orders. And that provision did actually generate public notice and anger.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png" width="988" height="645" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:645,&quot;width&quot;:988,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:932592,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/179294615?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GE6-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F422d228c-1a2c-4c97-8985-5bf3756dec68_988x645.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Trump hosted Zuckerberg for dinner during the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Education Task Force in September of 2025.</figcaption></figure></div><p>These two legal events are linked, and suggest that it’s not so much that the public doesn’t want something done about Meta, just that they rightfully came to understand years ago that this particular lawsuit wasn’t going to amount to anything.
