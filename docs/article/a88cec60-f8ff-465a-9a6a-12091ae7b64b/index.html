        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Chomsky and Faurisson together, alluding to the controversial 1979-1980 affair where Chomsky wrote a preface defending Faurisson&#039;s free speech rights, which became one of the most debated episodes of Chomsky&#039;s career and is directly relevant to understanding historical controversies surrounding him</p>

All the co-signers, including Noam, did agree, however, on the aim. Propel an ongoing conversation to continually update the broadly shared vision and strategy. Work to unify a growing left. Win a new world.</p><p>That document (still available at <a href="http://4liberation.org/">4liberation.org</a>) accrued three hundred signers, including ten organizations: Diem25, Academy of Democratic Modernity, Meta Center for Post Capitalist Civilization, Cooperation Jackson, Collaboration for Change, Srsly Wrong, Organizaciija Z’s Participatorno Druzbo, Real Utopia, Demokraisk Omstållning, and ZNetwork.The document highlights gender, race, class, authority, ecology, and internationalism. It does not elevate anyone above the rest. It urges mutual aid, collective support, listening, empathy, patient collective self-correction, and outreach. So did Noam lie when he signed it?</p><p>As I signed it, I wondered, what if everyone who has learned from Noam and who has appreciated his efforts over the decades decided to give the Twenty Theses a close read? What if lots, and then lots more, decided to sign it and to bring it to still greater attention? Perhaps that could help put movements on a path to change Noam’s epitaph, which he not long ago said he would like to be “He Tried,” to instead be “He Helped.” And to change all of ours as well, when our time comes, to “We Helped” by way of going from 300 signers to 3,000 and then to tens and hundreds of thousands and more, all committed to developing and enacting a shared vision and strategy. All working to unite diverse movements to undertake intersecting, mutually supportive campaigns. All seeking to win a new world that each helps all to win. Did Noam lie when he signed that? And in his lifetime of literally countless words and deeds, did he lie tens of thousands of times?</p><p>I also thought to myself back when Noam signed on, perhaps such actions could give meaning to the famous advisoryfrom Mother Jones, “don’t mourn, organize.” Can we celebrate Chomsky’s life, celebrate all our lives, but also and more importantly apply and expand his and our wisdom? Can we enlarge upon his and our commitment in </p>...</source>
