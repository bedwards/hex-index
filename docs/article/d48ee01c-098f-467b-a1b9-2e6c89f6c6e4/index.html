        <p>I don’t remember when I first heard about <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/">Letterform Archive</a>—a non-profit museum and special collections library in San Francisco that focuses on type, printing, and graphic design—but my first actual interaction with them was when I mistakenly tried to visit their library without an appointment, and, despite my oversight, was met with nothing but charm. I’ve always felt a kinship with the Archive’s approach to collecting; just as Casual Archivist has covered both <a href="https://casualarchivist.substack.com/p/10443492_casual-archivist-esq">formal</a> and <a href="https://casualarchivist.substack.com/p/9468644_casual-archivist-ham-handed">folk</a> design, their collection includes the <a href="https://letterformarchive.org/news/paul-rand/">seminal</a> and the <a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org/item?workID=lfa_skillscollections_0375">ephemeral</a> alike, from the <a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org/item?workID=lfa_antiquarianbound_0059">1200s</a> to <a href="https://oa.letterformarchive.org/item?workID=lfa_calligraphy_0079">present day</a> So, when I read in a recent newsletter about an amazing collection of donated chopstick sleeves, I knew I needed to ask if I could share some of the images, and Angie Wang’s writing about them, here!</p><div><hr></div><p><a href="https://letterformarchive.org/news/this-just-in-chopstick-sleeves-as-emissaries-of-japanese-typography-and-culture/?utm_source=Letterform+Archive+News&amp;utm_campaign=abd38a672c-Oct_21_Newsletter_Oct+22_Knitting+letters_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e30c8c0169-abd38a672c-446152889&amp;mc_cid=abd38a672c">Letterform Archive</a> treats both valuable and everyday objects with equal reverence. Rare books and type specimens live in the stacks alongside punk flyers and—thanks to a recent donation—chopstick sleeves. Though individually modest in their design and messaging, when considered as a whole, the 500 sleeves that comprise this collection map a singular history of Japanese ideology and aesthetics.</p><p>While chopstick sleeves date back to the Heian period (8th–12th century), paper <em>hashibukuro</em> (“chopstick envelopes”) emerged at the turn of the 20th century when disposable chopsticks and packaged meals gained popularity with the advent of train travel. In addition to ensuring cleanliness, printed paper chopstick sleeves became vernacular advertisements for shops and restaurants.</p><p>The collector, Susumu Kitagawa, was born in Fuji. He graduated from high school during World War II, and was immediately deployed to China. He survived the war — and imprisonment in a Siberian labor camp—and returned home to work for Fujikyu, a private railway company that operated the train line closest to Mount Fuji. Mr. Kitagawa traveled across Japan in his work for the Fujikyu tourism division. He fastidiously documented his trips with both written diaries and photographs that he carefully dated, captioned, and assembled into albums. (He would eventually compile over 175 photo albums, all prominently on display in his living room.) An archivist at heart, Mr. Kitagawa also collected sake cups and chopstick sleeves during his travels.</p><p>When asked what his collection — or the process of collecting — might have meant to her grandfather, Taiyo Kitagawa speculated that her grandfather’s habit of documenting and collecting may have been related to his experiences in the war. “He ...</p>
