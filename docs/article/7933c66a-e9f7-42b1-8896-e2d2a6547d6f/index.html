A few common threads associated with this misinterpreted idea is that it is considered to be the trait of a complacent person or of one who withdraws from situations that fall outside of their comfort zone.

This could apply to any kind of relation. A father-son, husband-wife, a couple of friends, or even siblings. </p><p>Quite often we tend to control every little detail, from the other person’s feelings to their reactions.
