Whether or not we get it often is a product of how much effort we put into the idea of getting it. How much determination we have. Particularly because different things of different importance can be easier or harder to achieve. The thing that makes the difference is determination. Our need to get it. Usually the easier things are not as satisfying to get. They didn't take as much effort because they are things like going to the coffee shop or getting to your job on time. While some people might struggle with these things, you don't need to reinvent the world in order to achieve them.</p><p>More important things like saving people's lives and surviving catastrophe require a lot more effort and thought being put into them. Naturally, it's not as easy to achieve because the consequences of not being able to achieve them are death. Either yours or the deaths of other people. In the worst scenarios, it's both and so much more. So you have to find a way to push yourself in a way that you probably never understood before. On some level, it's a combination of many of the things we've seen before in the process of self improvement. You don't just have to work harder and have goals, you need an entirely new level of determination.</p><p>Previously in this space, we've looked at the idea of <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-1-the-beginning">beginning the journey</a> of self-improvement. Then we looked at the <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-2-working-harder">importance of working harder</a> and pushing yourself further. We also looked at the problem of <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-3-achieving-goals">achieving goals</a> as well as the way in which having them can <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-4-facing-obstacles">create obstacles</a> in your path or other people can create them for you as a way to stop you. More recently we looked at how all these aspects can make you <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-5-trying-to-skip">want to skip steps in the process</a>, particularly if you have a hero or role model to look up to who can show you how much potential you actually have. But that's not the end of the story by any means. After all this effort, it can be difficult to maintain a determined focus. Especially with all the pain and suffering it can involve. But you still need it, even in the face of a potential </p>...</source>
