        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions deportations carried out under the Alien Enemies Act that were ruled illegal.

        <p class="topic-summary">The Greenland annexation discussion and US territorial ambitions echo the legal framework established by the Insular Cases, which defined the constitutional relationship between the US and its territories.

Another likely illegal strike on an alleged drug boat. And more turmoil at CBS News under “editor in chief” Bari Weiss. We’ve only documented the last four days, and ‘This Week in Democracy – Week 49’ is already one for the history books.</p><p>From the ongoing Epstein cover-up to ramping up tensions with Greenland to seizing Venezuelan oil tankers, Donald Trump and his cronies were busy yet again, harming democracy, hurting Americans and free societies worldwide, and undermining the Constitution.</p><p>There was unexpected good news, however: A Supreme Court that has let Trump get away with just about anything <em>finally</em> handed the president a major loss, ruling that, at least for now, he cannot send hundreds of National Guard members to Chicago over the objections of Illinois officials.</p><p>We’re sending ‘This Week in Democracy’ a bit early this week, so Team <strong>Zeteo</strong> can take some time away for the holidays. But we won’t stop documenting all the undemocratic things that Trump and his allies do while we’re away. We’ll include the days we missed in our first ‘This Week in Democracy’ in the new year.</p><p>Until then, here’s our last edition of 2025, a year that, when looking at the last 49 weeks, was quite possibly worse than we all could have imagined. It’s on the record:</p><h3><strong>Saturday, December 20</strong></h3><ul><li><p>On Twitter, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/2002481990755627050">posted</a> footage of the US Coast Guard and the Defense Department apprehending an oil tanker she said was last docked in Venezuela. Noem noted that the US “will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” adding, “We will find you, and we will stop you.” In a statement, the Venezuelan government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-interdicting-sanctioned-vessel-off-venezuelan-coast-officials-say-2025-12-20/">described</a> the apprehension as theft and hijacking, and accused the US of forcibly disappearing the crew on board the tanker.</p></li><li><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://apnews.com/article/release-epstein-files-justice-department-trump-9290fcaad1cb6fcb1cbc1befabc01994">removed</a> at least 16 Epstein-related files from its website, including a photo that showed an image of Trump alongside his wife, Melania, Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The DOJ later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/21/us/trump-news#todd-blanche-epstein-files-trump-redactions">reposted</a> the image after “further review.”</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Sunday, December 21</strong></h3><ul><li><p>CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/21/business/60-minutes-trump-bari-weiss.html">pulled</a> a ‘60 Minutes’ segment on the </p></li></ul>...</source>
