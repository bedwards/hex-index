        <p>Because I read for the same reason I write — to fathom my life and deepen my living — looking back on a year of life <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/best-of/">has always been</a> looking back on a year of reading. Here are the books I read this year that clarified and magnified my life, that will stay with me for the rest of it. </p>
<h5>THANKS</h5>

We know that they are <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/">entirely improbable</a>, that we <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/12/31/some-blessings-to-begin-with/">bless that bright improbability</a> with each flash of gratitude for it all, that if we pay attention closely and generously enough we are always repaid in gladness, that it is the handle of the door to the world.

<p>Imagine parting the bars and stepping out. Imagine waking up with a rush of gladness at everything we were never promised but got anyway — trees and music, clouds and consciousness, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/06/21/scallop-eye/">the cobalt eye of the scallop</a>, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/09/23/ginkgo/">the golden fan of the gingko</a>, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/08/23/ghost-pipe/">the alabaster chandelier of the ghost pipe</a>. </p>
