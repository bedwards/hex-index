        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions China&#039;s rare earths export control regime and potential &#039;validated end-user&#039; system. Understanding rare earth elements—their unique properties, why they&#039;re critical for electronics, EVs, and defense, and China&#039;s dominant 60%+ market share—provides essential context for why these export controls matter geopolitically.</p>

Excluding auto sales, <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/11/15/consumption-outlook-positive-despite-weak-october-macro-data-print/">retail sales of consumer goods grew 4.0%</a>, the strongest growth rate in three months.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile, growth in retail sales of services surged 6.1% y/y last month, the fastest rate of growth we’ve seen all year.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>This comes as, year-to-date, households have directed 46.6% of their expenditure <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/11/11/consumers-allocating-greater-proportion-of-expenditure-toward-services/">toward services</a> — the highest rate on record.</p></li><li><p>Meanwhile, consumer confidence surveys <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/11/12/consumer-confidence-ticks-up/">published in recent weeks</a> by the central bank (PBoC) and stats bureau (NBS) show sentiment improving after years of gloom.</p></li><li><p>The PBoC income confidence index ticked up in Q3 to its highest score in six quarters.</p></li><li><p>And the NBS consumer confidence index edged up in September to its highest score in almost 3 years.</p></li></ul><p><strong>This budding confidence boost among households, combined with the accelerating shift toward the purchase of services </strong>—<strong> as opposed to goods </strong>—<strong> is an underappreciated aspect of the China consumption story.</strong></p><ul><li><p>It suggests that households — and household spending — may be fundamentally more resilient than conventional wisdom suggests.</p></li></ul><p><strong>I touched on all this </strong>—<strong> along with a deep dive into China’s plan for its export sector in the years ahead </strong>—<strong> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-trivium-china-podcast/id1780844799">this week’s</a> Trivium China <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5aUtSaWat104pAm562XqHW">podcast</a>, with my colleague Dinny McMahon.</strong></p><ul><li><p>Make </p></li>...</ul>
