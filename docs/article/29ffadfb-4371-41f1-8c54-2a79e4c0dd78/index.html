        <p>I have been thinking about this topic for a while, and I am glad I have finally found the time to gather my thoughts into an article. I feel like it’s pretty rare to see people discuss incentives in cybersecurity (except for my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/resilientcyber/">Chris Hughes</a>, who emphasizes this topic frequently in his blog and on LinkedIn). This is quite surprising given that everything in our industry centers around incentives. In this piece, I share some thoughts about this problem, discuss what I think are its most important aspects, and why more people should care.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>This issue is <a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/sponsor">brought</a> to you by… <a href="https://www.intruder.io/downloads/exposure-management-index?utm_source=ventureinsecurity&amp;utm_medium=p_referral&amp;utm_campaign=global|fixed|index">Intruder</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.intruder.io/downloads/exposure-management-index?utm_source=ventureinsecurity&amp;utm_medium=p_referral&amp;utm_campaign=global|fixed|index">As AI Enables Bad Actors, How Are 3,000+ Teams Responding?</a></strong></p><p>Shadow IT, supply chains, and cloud sprawl are expanding attack surfaces - and AI is helping attackers exploit weaknesses faster.

Someone forgot to change the password. Someone wasn’t able to track all the assets in a centralized system. Someone decided to grant a contractor more permissions than they needed, but forgot to revoke access when the contractor left. This list can go on and on, but the fact that matters here is that most of the time, what gets companies breached is something the security team can’t fix on their own. It is what my friend Yaron Levi calls “lack of operational discipline”.</p><p>None of this is rocket science, and anyone who has worked in security for over ...</p>
