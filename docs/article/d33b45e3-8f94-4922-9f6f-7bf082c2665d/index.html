Construction is expected to begin in 2021 <strong>if</strong> the remaining permits are acquired, <strong>if</strong> the money arrives, and <strong>if</strong> it isn’t legally blocked. That’s a lot of “ifs.”</p><p><strong>The key players:</strong> Governor Abbott, Texas Central (the construction company), Japan, and Texans Against High Speed Rail (a non-profit organization).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The first problem:</strong> Property rights. <a href="https://www.texascentral.com/project/">Texas Central</a> says they are, legally speaking, a railroad and wants to exercise eminent domain (where they pay a market price for the parts of land they need). Some affected land-owners aren’t buying it, taking their arguments to court. Splicing together chunks of land for a 200 mph bullet-train that connects two urban centers is the fastest way to reach Texas’ longest rivalry: city vs. country, urban vs. rural.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The second problem:</strong> Money. So far, the funding for the project has been through private means, but opponents argue that Texas Central is under-funded and once the rail gets going, it’s only a matter of time before the public is on the hook for the bill. Yet, with President Biden’s seriously loaded infrastructure plan making serious waves in Congress, there is a chance the feds might chip in to help cover costs. Heck, Secretary Pete Buttigieg even name-dropped Texas in reference to the bill.</p><p><strong>Where they stand:</strong> Abbott has given the project his blessing, putting him squarely on team-choo-choo. Texas Central has more paperwork to file and court cases to fend off and money problems, but they are a shovel away from breaking ground (<strong>if</strong> Uncle Sam buys that shovel). Japan has promised 300 million in addition to its technology. The land-owners and others in opposition of the project are represented by the organization <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TexansAgainstHSR/">Texans Against HSR</a>, and are playing their cards with the courts and the legislature where they have found success in the past.</p><p><strong>How did Japan get mixed up in all of this? </strong>Similar to Apple’s annoyingly unique charger, rail technology isn’t universal. Japan stands to gain from this whole Texas venture by increasing its grip on the global market for high-speed rail. As countries deal with climate change and congested roads, rail presents itself as a valuable solution to both. Some opponents such as Rep. Steve Toth (R-Conroe), </p>...</source>
