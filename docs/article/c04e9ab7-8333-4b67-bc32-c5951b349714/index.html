      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>To kick off the year, I've finally been able to complete the draft of this AI Research Highlights of 2024 article. It covers a variety of topics, from mixture-of-experts models to new LLM scaling laws for precision.</p><p>Reflecting on all the major research highlights of 2024 would probably require writing an entire book. It's been an extraordinarily productive year, even for such a fast-moving field. To keep things reasonably concise, I decided to focus exclusively on LLM research this year. But even then, how does one choose a subset of papers from such an eventful year? The simplest approach I could think of was to highlight one paper per month: January through December 2024.</p><p>So, in this article, I'll share research papers that I personally found fascinating, impactful, or, ideally, both. However, note that this article is just <em>Part One</em>, focusing on the first half of 2024 from January through June. <em>Part 2</em> of this series, covering July to December, will be shared later in January.</p><p>The selection criteria are admittedly subjective, based on what stood out to me this year. I've also aimed for some variety, so it's not all just about LLM model releases.</p><p>If you're looking for a broader list of AI research papers, feel free to check out my earlier article (<a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-research-papers-the-2024-list">LLM Research Papers: The 2024 List</a>).</p><p><em>For those who read my <a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-research-papers-the-2024-list">previous article</a>, I’m happy to share that I’m already feeling a bit better and slowly but steadily recovering! I also want to express my heartfelt thanks for all the kind wishes and support. It truly meant the world to me and helped me through some tough days!</em></p><p>Happy new year and happy reading!</p><h1>1. January: Mixtral's Mixture of Experts Approach</h1><p>Only a few days into January 2024, the Mistral AI team shared the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088">Mixtral of Experts</a> paper (8 Jan 2024), which described Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) model.</p><p>The paper and model were both very influential at the time, as Mixtral 8x7B was (one of) the first open-weight MoE LLMs with an impressive performance: it outperformed Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across various benchmarks.</p><h2><strong>1.1 Understanding MoE models</strong></h2><p>An MoE, or Mixture of Experts, is an ensemble model that combines several smaller "expert" subnetworks inside the GPT-like decoder architecture. Each subnetwork is said to be responsible for handling different types of tasks or, more concretely, tokens. The ...</p>
