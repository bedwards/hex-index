        <p>The lively streets of Greenwich Village in New York City hold a secret history, one that challenges common perceptions of the area. It’s an ironic twist of history that this very neighborhood, often associated with white wealth and bohemian life, was once a cornerstone of the earliest free Black life in America—possibly even the first free Black settlement in the colonies.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Dutch Origins: “Land of the Blacks” (1640s)</h3><p>To understand this history, we must look back to the 1640s, when the area was part of the Dutch colony of New Netherland. The Dutch West India Company formally established this land as the “Land of the Blacks” (<em>Winkel-straat</em>, roughly meaning “Corner Street” or “Black Alley”).</p><p>The company granted land tracts to freed and “half-free” Africans, such as Manuel de Gerrit de Rues. This wasn’t done purely out of goodwill; these grants served a strategic purpose. The Black settlers were placed in a buffer zone outside the main, walled settlement of New Amsterdam (which is now the Financial District or Fi-Di). This location essentially protected the main colony from the Indigenous Lenape Native Americans who lived further north. In exchange for this service and a small annual tax, the Black settlers gained a precarious foothold in the new world.</p><div><hr></div><h3>English Rule and Reclaiming Freedom (Post-1664)</h3><p>When the English took control of the colony in 1664, renaming it New York, they brought a much stricter system of racial segregation and oppression. The new governor, Richard Nicolls, soon began the systematic process of seizing the land that the Dutch had granted to the free Black residents. This displacement scattered the community and curtailed the freedom they had briefly known.</p><p>However, the story didn’t end there. After New York abolished slavery in 1827, a wave of formerly enslaved people and their descendants began to return to the familiar ground of the original “Land of the Blacks.”</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Rise of “Little Africa” (Mid-1800s)</h3><p>This growing community, concentrated around Minetta Lane, officially earned the name “Little Africa.” It quickly grew into a vibrant and crucial cultural hub. With over 5,000 Black residents at its peak, the neighborhood boasted its own banks, schools, and cultural institutions like the groundbreaking African Grove Theater (the first Black theater company in America).</p><p>Nearby institutions played a vital role, too. Mother Zion A.M.E. Church (one of the oldest Black churches in the country) became a critical stop on the ...</p>
