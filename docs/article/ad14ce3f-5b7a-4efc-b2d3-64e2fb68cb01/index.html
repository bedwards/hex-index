        <p><em>Happy Friday. I was back on the <a href="https://macrohive.com/hive-podcasts/ep-335-marc-rubinstein-on-ai-bubble-private-credit-jane-street-rise/">Macro Hive podcast</a> this week, talking to host Bilal Hafeez about a range of things we’ve addressed in the newsletter over the past few months: AI bubbles past and present, the 1907 crisis and the rise of non-banks, private credit risks, fraud cycles, Jane Street’s technological edge, blockchain’s slow creep into banking, and what AI means for entry-level finance jobs. We also touched on two books I’m reading: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/1929-Inside-Greatest-History-Shattered/dp/0593296966/">1929</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Land-Trap-History-Worlds-Oldest/dp/0593719719/">The Land Trap</a>. The episode is available on <a href="https://macrohive.com/hive-podcasts/ep-335-marc-rubinstein-on-ai-bubble-private-credit-jane-street-rise/">all the usual platforms</a>.</em></p><p><em>I’m also hosting <a href="https://go.alpha-sense.com/wb-imp-genai-fs-netinterest-private-credit/?utm_source=pt_NetInterest&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_campaign=SWB_DG_12-04-25_IMP-GENAI_FS_NetInterest-Private-Credit">a webinar</a> on December 4th about the private credit marketplace, sponsored by AlphaSense.

For now, though, back to the newsletter...</em></p><div><hr></div><p>For all the talk of bubbles in <a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/bubble-trouble">equity markets</a>, <a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/october-throwbacks">private credit</a> and elsewhere, the market that hosted the last great bubble has been quiet. It’s still vast: At roughly $13.5 trillion, more mortgage loans are outstanding than corporate bonds in the US. But its footprint has been shrinking. As <em>The Economist</em> <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/11/19/americas-huge-mortgage-market-is-slowly-dying">notes</a> this week, mortgage balances have fallen by almost 30 percentage points relative to the size of the economy since the peak of the last boom, taking them back to late-1990s levels. Set against the value of American homes, the decline looks even starker: mortgage debt now amounts to barely a quarter of household real-estate wealth, the lowest share in more than six decades.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png" width="360" height="371" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:371,&quot;width&quot;:360,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:14826,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.netinterest.co/i/179578287?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!thsG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3430b7e4-7a64-41bd-a210-25d85a6e30f8_360x371.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Source: The Economist</figcaption></figure></div><p>For mortgage bankers, this didn’t initially pose much of a problem. As long as interest rates were drifting lower, they could rely on a steady stream of refinancing. Every decline in rates invited borrowers to reshuffle their loans, creating new mortgages even when nothing new was being financed. It was flow without growth – and for years it kept the business humming. When rates fell to almost unimaginable lows in 2021 – touching 2.65% on a 30 year fixed-rate mortgage – originations swelled to $4.4 trillion, more than twice their usual level, handing a windfall to the bankers who sat in the middle.</p><p>But with rates now above 6%, those days are long gone, and refinancing activity has collapsed. Intercontinental Exchange, owner of a mortgage technology platform, <a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/resources/data-reports/november-2025-mortgage-monitor">estimates</a> that at current rates, there are 1.7 million borrowers out there with capacity to refinance.
