"We demonstrate that the visual system may indeed converge, across various higher-level visual regions, towards representations that are aligned with LLM embeddings."<br><br><strong>What they did:</strong> They studied the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), which records the fMRI data from human brain responses to viewing thousands of complex natural scenes taken from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) image database. To look at the differences between LLMs and human brains they took the captions from the dataset and used a sentence encoder based on the transformer architecture to project these descriptions into the embedding space of a LLM. They then " correlated representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from LLM embeddings of the image captions with RDMs constructed from brain activity patterns obtained while participants viewed the corresponding natural scenes".<br><br><strong>The results show a lot of similarity</strong>: "LLM embeddings are able to predict visually evoked brain responses across higher level visual areas in the ventral, lateral and parietal streams". In other words, LLM embeddings of scene captions successfully characterize brain activity evoked by viewing the natural scenes. "We suggest that LLM embeddings capture visually evoked brain activity by reflecting the statistical regularities of the world, learned through their extensive language training, in ways that align with sensory processing."</p><p><strong>The simplest way to understand this:</strong></p><ul><li><p>When the brain finds two images similar, the LLM also finds their captions similar.</p></li><li><p>When the brain finds two images different, the LLM also finds their captions different.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Why this matters - internal representational complexity maps </strong>...</p>
