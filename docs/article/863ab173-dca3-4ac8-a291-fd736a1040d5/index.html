ALSO better Meta Data and Book Descriptions. Get the software ‘Publisher Rocket‘ to research your books and your competition. <strong>Have confidence in your work! </strong>Selling when you have to look in a reader/customer’s eyes can work wonders. Ask yourself, ‘Why should someone buy this book?’” ~ <a href="https://indieauthors.substack.com/p/call-for-submissions-bookstore-and">Tom McAuliffe</a></p></li><li><p>“Making <strong>one-on-one connections</strong> and developing new and old relationships.
