So the competition between screens vs. reading for the mind of the American child is fundamentally unfair. This is <em>literacy lag</em>.</p><p>Despite what many education experts would have you believe, literacy lag is not some natural or biological law. Children can learn to read very early, even in the 2-4 age range, but our schools simply take their sweet time teaching the skill; usually it is only in the 7-8 age range that independent reading for pleasure becomes a viable alternative to screens (and often more like 9-10, as that’s when the “<a href="https://pamwithers.com/the-fourth-grade-slump-syndrome/">4th grade slump</a>” occurs, based on kids switching from academic exercises to actually reading to learn). Lacking other options, children must get their pre-literate media consumption from screens, which they form a lifelong habitual and emotional attachment to. </p><p>Nowadays, by the age of 6, about 62% of children in the US have a <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2025-common-sense-census-web-2.pdf">personal tablet of their own</a>, and children in the 5-8 age range experience about 3.5 hours of screen time a day (increasingly short-form content, like YouTube Shorts and TikTok).</p><p>I understand why. Parenting is hard, if just because filling a kid’s days and hours and minutes and seconds is, with each tick of the clock, itself hard. However, I noticed something remarkable from <a href="https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/how-to-teach-your-two-year-old-to">teaching my own child</a> to read. Even as a rowdy “threenager,” he got noticeably easier as literacy kicked in. His moments of curling up with a book became moments of rejuvenating parental calm. And I think this is the exact same effect sought by parents giving their kids tablets at that age. </p><p>Acting up in the car? Have you read this book? Screaming wildly because you’re somehow both overtired and undertired? Please go read a book and chill out!</p><p>This is because reading and tablets are directly competitive media for a child’s time.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> So while independent reading requires <a href="https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/the-big-guide-to-teaching-little">about a year</a> of upfront work, and takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes a day, after that early reading feels a lot like owning a tablet (and while reading is no panacea, neither are tablets).</p><p>The cultural reliance on screen-based media is not because parents don’t care. I think </p>...</source>
