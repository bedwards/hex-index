        <p>There are many discussions about how AI is changing the way the cybersecurity industry operates, and I am certainly the last person to argue with this thought. At the same time, I have developed the perspective that for startups, it doesn’t change the game as much as many assume it does. Before I lose you completely, let me explain.</p><p>For this conversation to make sense, I think we need to separate two lines of thought: what AI enables for customers, and what AI solves for startups. These are two very different conversations, and while I want to focus the article on the latter, it won’t fully make sense if I don’t briefly address the former.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>This issue is <a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/sponsor">brought</a> to you by… <a href="https://www.harmonic.security/harmonic-mcp-gateway-early-access?utm_source=vis&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mcpoct25">Harmonic Security</a>. </em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.harmonic.security/harmonic-mcp-gateway-early-access?utm_source=vis&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=mcpoct25">Early Access Open: MCP Gateway with Intelligent Data Controls</a></strong></p><p>Agentic AI is moving fast and most teams have no visibility into what’s actually happening.</p><p>Harmonic’s MCP Gateway changes that.</p><p>It’s a lightweight, developer-friendly gateway that gives security teams visibility into MCP usage and the ability to set real controls, blocking risky clients or data flows before something slips through.</p><p>We’re opening early access to a limited number of forward-leaning security teams.

Now, this is not because LLMs are perfect at detection, or that AI has no gaps (they aren’t, and it does). A much more important reason why I am bullish on the opportunities this wave of AI unlocks is simple. Well over 90% (and some people would even say 95-97%) of security teams’ day-to-day is not some advanced incident response or dealing with nation-states. Most of the security teams’ work has nothing to do with chasing advanced adversaries. Much more than that, it’s boring, mundane stuff like:</p><ul><li><p>Updating reports and dashboards for leadership</p></li><li><p>Collecting screenshots and evidence for audits</p></li><li><p>Responding to repetitive access and compliance requests</p></li><li><p>Reconciling data across tools and systems</p></li><li><p>Investigating low-priority alerts that never amount to much</p></li><li><p>Documenting findings and closing out endless tickets</p></li></ul><p>I previously wrote a dedicated deep dive about this if you are interested in reading more:<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/most-of-the-security-teams-work-has"> Most of the security teams’ work has nothing to do with chasing advanced adversaries</a>.</p><p>The main point here is that all this manual stuff is ...</p>
