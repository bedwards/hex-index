You know. Class-conscious. <em>Egalitarian</em>. And what I pointed out in that earlier piece is that these egalitarian politics are a strange fit for the kind of people that <em>n+1</em> publishes and employs, who are almost exclusively those whose resumes are absolutely festooned with all the markings of elite success. I guess the coarse version of this is a kind of right-wing stereotype - the left is all limousine liberals, or whatever - but I think what I’m saying is more particular and more nuanced than that. And more unfortunate.</p><p>I thought about that piece when I read <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/empire-madness-khameer-kidia-psychiatric-imperialism-capitalism-review/">this review</a> of Dr. Khameer Kidia’s new antipsychiatry missive <em>Empire of Madness</em>. (What a title!) The review was written by Dr. Pria Anand. These “Dr.s” are not of the PhD variety, oh no - these two are medical doctors. And their credentials! My lord. You know how people say that they thought they knew what a rich person was, and then they went away to college, and they discovered what being <em>really </em>rich means? That’s kind of how I feel, looking at <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/2282288/khameer-kidia/">Dr. Kidia</a>’s and <a href="https://www.priaanand.com/">Dr. Anand</a>’s almost comically impressive résumés: I thought I knew what an impressive meritocrat was, and then I was made aware of these two. Ivy League degrees stacked onto Ivy League degrees, awards out the wazoo, publications in both the most prestigious academic journals and the most impressive popular press publications, influence at think tanks and foundations, every pore of their bodies sweating out accomplishment. They give <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/r-f-kuang-and-the-endless-regress">RF Kuang</a> a run for her money. And, of course, they share that very strange kind of 21st century radicalism with so many people who have worked at <em>n+1</em> and similar publications, that fusion of relentless upper-class </p>...</source>
