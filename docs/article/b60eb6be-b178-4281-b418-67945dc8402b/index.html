I’ll tell you. She killed the big “Inside CECOT” story about the torture prison in El Salvador that was supposed to run on “60 Minutes” Sunday night. The story involved the Venezuelan immigrants who were flown by Trump’s ICE, against a judge’s order, to El Salvador, where in the prison they were beaten and sexually assaulted. Weiss told the producers that one of the things the story needed was an in-person interview with chief immigration Nazi, Stephen Miller. She helpfully provided them with Miller’s contact information, you know, because Bari Weiss is so plugged-in that she has stuff like White House phone numbers and email addresses at her fingertips.</p><p>There are several “as if’s” here. As if the producers hadn’t thought about interviewing Miller themselves. As if they hadn’t already contacted his office and requested an interview or at least on-the-record comments for the DECOT story. As if <em>the damn “60 Minutes” team hadn’t been doing this kind of reporting better than anyone on the planet for the last 56 years.</em></p><p>Can you think of another bumbling amateur who is running a large organization he is not qualified to run? Hmmmm…let’s see…could it be Pete Hegseth? You remember Major Hegseth, who hadn’t run anything larger than a small non-profit supporting veterans before he became Secretary of Defense and was put in charge of more than 4.5 million uniformed and civilian people who work for the Department of Defense. Hegseth was the genius who included his wife, brother, and the editor for The Atlantic in a chat group on Signal as the Navy and Air Force bombed and rocketed Houthi strongholds in Yemen back in March, during which he shared the exact times of attack, what aircraft were involved, and what weapons they were using – all of this in real time as the attack was taking place.</p><p>We know enough about Pete to last us about 3 extremely unpleasant lifetimes. Let’s have a look at Bari. I’m not going to bore you with the story of her career as a junior editor at the Wall Street Journal and her time writing for and occasionally editing stories for the New York Times editorial section.
