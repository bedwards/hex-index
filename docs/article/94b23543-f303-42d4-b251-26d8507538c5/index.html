Much of Clark County doesn’t want anything to do with light rail, and certainly not to pay for it. The project’s planning documents called for an agreement to be reached years ago--but it still hasn’t happened.</p><h3>Must Read</h3><p>The end of federal funding for transit? <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/11/trump-administration-eliminate-transit-funding-00652923">Politico</a> reports (paywall), that leaked documents show that the US Department of Transportation is proposing to eliminate federal funding for transit through the highway trust funds and also end the ability of states to “flex” highway funding to transit. The results, according to <a href="https://t4america.org/2025/11/17/t4america-statement-on-usdot-proposal-to-eliminate-federal-transit-funding/">Transportation for America</a>, would be devastating for the nation’s transit systems.</p><p>In a statement, Transportation for America’s Steve Davis says:</p><blockquote><p>“This short-sighted proposal will annihilate state and local transportation budgets, strand millions of Americans who depend on transit every day in red and blue states alike, produce chaos and increase congestion, seize control from states, and utterly fail to actually solve our most pressing long-term transportation funding issues. The highway formula program <em>alone</em> spends $20 billion more than what the gas tax brings in every year—stealing transit funds won’t change that.”</p></blockquote><p>The good news, if there is any, according to Davis, is that this should put dramatically change the discussion over proposed transportation reauthorization legislation in the coming year. This major existential threat to transit should end the “business as usual” approach to reauthorization, and provoke some serious examination of a program that has routinely raided general funds to subsidize highway construction and produced little to show for it in terms of tangible results like reduced congestion or improved safety.</p><p><a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/reminder-crypto-is-a-trump-trade?publication_id=277517&amp;post_id=179345744&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=2fsv&amp;triedRedirect=true">Paul Krugman on cities and agglomeration economies</a>.
