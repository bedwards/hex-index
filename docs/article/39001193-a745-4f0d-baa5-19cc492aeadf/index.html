        <p>A leaked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/22/amazon-workers-shortage-leaked-memo-warehouse">memo</a> from mid-2021 revealed that Amazon executives expressed concerns over Amazon running out of workers in the US by 2024. For years, workers and labor groups have criticized this issue, as Amazon reported a 150 percent employee turnover in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic began, citing high injury rates, unfair and automated HR policies, and high productivity quotas as parts of Amazon’s business model that relies on a constant cycle of churning in and out new workers. </p><p>Patrick O’Rourke worked as a picker at an Amazon warehouse in Sparrows Point, Maryland from September 2020 until July 2021.</p><p>During a work shift in May 2021, one of O’Rourke’s ankles started badly hurting.

He tried to get a work accommodation that would permit him to take breaks to sit for an hour or two during his shifts, but he was never informed the accommodations were accepted and he was told to return to work after 3 weeks without any accommodations. He also said an Amazon HR representative did call him to offer a different position, but within 24 hours another rep negated that offer.</p><p>O’Rourke wound up just quitting rather than hope fighting for accommodations and benefits would resolve the issue without worsening the injury. </p><p>“If I ...</p>
