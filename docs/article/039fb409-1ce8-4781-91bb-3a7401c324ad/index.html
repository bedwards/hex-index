        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions preclearance in the context of international travel and how it affects arrival time calculations. Most travelers don&#039;t fully understand how preclearance works, which countries have it, and why it exists—knowledge that directly applies to the article&#039;s advice.</p>

But the spreadsheet version at the end still reflects our most comprehensive approach. The text of the article is unchanged from August.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>My <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/always-be-blogging">overriding philosophy</a> for this newsletter is to write about what I know about. And I know a lot about air travel. Over the past 15 years, I’ve taken something like 800 flights.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> That tally includes literally everything from the middle seat of the bathroom-adjacent back row on Spirit Airlines to first class on Emirates (I lucked into a free upgrade).</p><p>So as we’re approaching the peak of summer travel season, it’s time to put this out there: U.S. air travel gets a bad rap. Many American airports are much more pleasant than they were even a few years ago. And security lines are often faster — as of last month, you <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tsa-shoes-rule-expires/">don’t even have to take your shoes off anymore</a>. We can all remember our worst experiences, and I’ve had a few, from having to double back because I left my wallet at my hotel in Raleigh to not realizing that my connection in Sao Paulo was at a different airport. But the default experience is trending toward efficiency.</p><p>Guidance on when to arrive at the airport has been slow to catch up, however. At View From The Wing, Gary Leff recently estimated that <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/83-billion-wasted-showing-up-at-the-airport-3-hours-before-your-flight-is-a-system-failure-no-ones-trying-to-fix/">$83 billion worth of productive time last year was wasted</a> because of people showing up hours in advance at American airports.</p><p>Although I agree with the spirit of Leff’s critique, I don’t quite agree with his calculations. For one thing, excess time at the airport isn’t exactly wasted. <em>Some</em> airports can be pleasant spots for people watching, putting headphones on and getting some work done, or having a refreshing pre-flight beverage.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>But also, although <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/how-early-should-you-get-to-the-airport-7509351">many authorities</a> recommend arriving as early as 2 or 2½ hours in advance even for domestic flights, you really don’t need to do that. Not unless you’re facing a multiplicity of adverse circumstances. As in some other areas, the experts are irrationally risk-averse.</p><p>True, most people don’t follow TSA guidance to a T, but many travelers are <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/dont-be-a-nit">nittier</a> about air travel than they need to be. An (unscientific) <a href="https://x.com/bryan_caplan/status/1952598436760699183">poll</a> on X </p>...</source>
