        <p>Dear readers!</p><p>I wanted to share a couple of updates with you. </p><p>After a looong two-year pause following the birth of my daughter, I have returned to writing The Space Roundup, but now as part of The Space Race team. I am sending it every Tuesday. If you would like to keep up with the latest space updates, you can subscribe here: <strong><a href="https://www.thespacerace.news/subscribe">https://www.thespacerace.news/subscribe</a></strong></p><p><strong>Wait, there’s more!</strong> <br>Additionally, I have been working on a non-space-related project that aligns with my passion for sharing a positive and hopeful perspective on reality. </p><p>The media and social networks often amplify negative news to gain more clicks and impressions, which leads to sadness, anxiety, and a negative view of the world. This affected me too! </p><p>That's why I decided to launch <strong><a href="http://latestgoodnews.com/">"Latest Good News"</a></strong> a system that gathers and analyzes hundreds of headlines daily to select the most positive, constructive, and hopeful ones. These are then sent out as a newsletter to a community of subscribers. </p><p>Since creating it, initially for myself and then for friends and family, I start each day with a positive message, helping me focus better and being happier and more relaxed.</p><p>If you're curious and would like to try it out, you can sign up for free here: </p><p><strong><a href="http://latestgoodnews.com/">http://latestgoodnews.com/</a></strong></p><p>Looking forward to hearing back from you!</p><p>Cheers, </p><p>Juan - <a href="https://twitter.com/curiousastrona">The Curious Astronaut</a></p>
