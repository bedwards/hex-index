          <strong>Positive psychology</strong>
          <span class="read-time">1 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Jeremy Clifton&#039;s research on &#039;primal world beliefs&#039; and optimism as a civic virtue.

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article describes how teaching children that the world is &#039;dangerous, unjust, and stacked against them&#039; produces &#039;lassitude, even despair&#039; and withdrawal rather than engagement.
