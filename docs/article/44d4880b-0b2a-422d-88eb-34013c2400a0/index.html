Within the space of only a year, productions such as <em>28 Years Later</em>, <em>2073</em>, <em>Apocalypse Z</em>, or <em>The Last of Us</em> all appear to conveniently bring to mind the famous motto of Mark Fisher’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Capitalist-Realism-There-Alternative-Books/dp/1846943175">Capitalist Realism</a></em>, that “it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism.” For every hundred films imagining some form of the collapse of civilisation, hardly any films present visions of a civilization that continues after capitalism comes to an end. The historically more recent problem of the end of capitalism, it seems, is more difficult to face than the end of the world as such.</p><p>But is this really the right conclusion to draw today in the face of a proliferation of apocalyptic cinema? We should recall one of Freud’s methods of interpretation here: in dreams or literature, multiple presentations of an object often signifies that this very object is in fact what is missing. For example, a multiplicity of maternal imagoes will arise at the exact moment where maternal affection is the very thing that is most traumatically absent. In the same way, what seems clear from the masses of apocalyptic, end-of-world films is that it is precisely <em>the end of the world</em> that we have a great deal of trouble in thinking. ‘The end of the world’ is in fact a very malleable term: it could imply the almost complete end of biological life due to a solar or nuclear event, or it could more solipsistically imply the end of human civilisation. It could be triggered by a virus, global warming, a nuclear fallout, a zombie apocalypse, or universal infertility. The endless catalogue of films depicting ‘the end </p>...</source>
