Even though the merge itself was a success, there were some minor issues that showed up immediately post-merge but were quickly resolved once the root cause was identified. As far as I understand it, these issues shouldn’t show up on mainnet and aren’t considered ‘merge-related’.</p><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/parithosh_j/status/1544968914777645056?s=20&amp;t=K9dVEmTX5FX3oksuuED2vQ&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Sepolia merged successfully! \n\nAfter some config issues, the chain is finalizing.

Once this issue was fixed, network participation jumped up to the expected number of ~95% (it’s lower than 100% due to some validators being permanently offline due to lost keys). Nevertheless, it’s great that this “edge case” issue popped up in testing even if it’s not going to be something that we really need to worry about for the mainnet merge transition!</p><p>Sepolia’s issues also showed us, once again, just how resilient the Beacon Chain is to any sort of unexpected behavior. Even though 25-30% of blocks were not being proposed, the chain was still able to finalize because more than 2/3rds of the network was still online and validating. Of course, missed blocks on mainnet would lead to a degraded user experience, but this is the Beacon Chain working as designed as Ethereum favors liveness above all else. I would also expect an issue like the one seen on Sepolia to be rectified even quicker on mainnet since there is real money on the line.</p><p>Alright, so where to from here? Well there is an AllCoreDevs call happening on Friday where I’m sure the Sepolia merge will be discussed and then the next call will be on July 21st. I expect this call </p></source>...</source>
