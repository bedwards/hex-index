        <p>The Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) concluded on Thursday, <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/12/11/192655/">wrapping up two days</a> of meetings between China’s senior policymakers, as they finalized their goals for China’s economy next year.</p><p><strong>Our top takeaway:</strong> Central government spending will increase in 2026, but the good old days of large-scale stimulus aren’t coming back.</p><ul><li><p>Beijing remains wedded to its goal of delivering <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/10/26/xis-big-bet-the-weekly-recap/">productivity-led growth</a> via innovation and industrial upgrading.</p></li><li><p>In 2026, officials will deploy additional resources toward putting a floor under the weakest parts of the economy, so they don’t derail the main agenda.</p></li></ul><p>In short, Beijing wants to stabilize the economy — and domestic demand in particular — by providing support, not stimulus.</p><h2>The big picture</h2><p>The readout from the CEWC is invariably a big-picture policy document that’s frustratingly thin on detail.</p><ul><li><p>The details will come in the weeks and months ahead.</p></li><li><p>For the time being, we have to make do with the readout’s vague commitments to “optimize” this and “standardize” that.</p></li></ul><p>That said, there are nonetheless certain things we can indeed take away from the CEWC readout.</p><p><strong>First, Beijing’s main domestic concern is the:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>“Prominent contradiction between strong supply and weak demand”</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>That’s not a surprise.</strong> Retail sales of consumer goods have been <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/10/29/fourth-plenum-proposals-signal-party-wants-stronger-consumption-but-without-stronger-medicine/">chronically weak</a> all year. Meanwhile, China’s factory output has been going gangbusters.</p><ul><li><p>Robust export growth has provided China’s manufacturers with some relief — but even then, industrial overcapacity has emerged as a huge problem.</p></li></ul><p>So what is Beijing going to do about it?</p><p><strong>The CEWC readout promised to “thoroughly address ‘involutionary’ competition,” but that was the only mention of either involution or overcapacity.</strong></p><p>Instead, the demand side of the equation got more airtime, with the readout saying Beijing will:</p><ul><li><p><em>“Prioritize domestic demand and build a strong domestic market”</em></p></li></ul><p><strong>On this front, the biggest commitment to new spending was the readout’s promise that the central government will support the “stabilization and recovery” of investment by:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>“Appropriately increasing the scale of budgetary investment [in public works]”</em></p></li></ul><p>That’s significant for two reasons.</p><ul><li><p>First, it acknowledges that the <a href="https://triviumchina.com/2025/11/24/investment-meltdown-the-weekly-recap/">recent collapse in fixed asset investment</a> (FAI) – which declined 12.2% y/y in October and 7.1% in September – is a real problem.</p></li><li><p>And second, it shows that Beijing is taking responsibility for reviving investment – and not pushing the fiscal burden down to local authorities.</p></li></ul><p>We’ve already seen Beijing move in this direction.
