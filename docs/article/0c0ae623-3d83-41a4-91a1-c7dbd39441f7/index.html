But it has clearly struck a nerve!</p><p>Below are two more super thoughtful and meaty responses. The first is from Boston College’s Shaun Dougherty, one of the nation’s leading scholars of career and technical education. The second is by Jill Pinsky of Watershed Advisors, who served as Deputy Assistant Superintendent at the Louisiana Department of Education in the mid 2010s, where she overhauled the state’s accountability system, in which WorkKeys plays a role.</p><p><strong>Shaun Dougherty:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Having a secondary test for high school accountability could improve the information that students and schools have to improve student outcomes after high school graduation. All students need the minimum skills to be adaptable and pursue additional training as the economy continues to change. However, two decades of test-based accountability have yielded too little useful information at the point of high school exit, especially for students who either cannot or will not enroll directly in college.</p><p>At present, nearly everyone takes the same tests of math and English language arts as a condition of state accountability. And while states complement these tests (or use elements of them) with measures to define college and career readiness, the metrics being used may not be as useful to students, employers, and colleges as the spirit of accountability should intend. In particular, among students who score at the low end of high school tests of math and reading and that are used for accountability, it is pretty clear that those lower scores are not helpful to the students and provide only limited information for schools about how to best advise students in their post school plans. Specifically, if students score above some agreed upon threshold for graduation, they may not meet the threshold for college readiness (e.g., an ACT score of 17 or higher in Tennessee), particularly readiness for colleges that are </p></blockquote>...</source>
