        <p>Writing online about mathematics and machine learning started as a creative hobby for me, a way to recharge my batteries after cofounding a failed startup that burned my savings and two years of my life.</p><p>I have always had a passion for teaching. Even as an undergrad, I often found myself explaining the material to my coursemates. In my third year, I became a teaching assistant, teaching probability theory to students only one year below me. Later, as a researcher in a computational biology group, I used to give spontaneous lectures on (guess what) the mathematics of machine learning, sometimes even helping my grad student colleagues prepare for calculus and linear algebra exams.</p><p>The conventional advice is <em>“don’t follow your dreams, do whatever makes you the most money.”</em> But I’m not a conventional person. I walk my path, not others’. So, in 2021, I started a project with no promise of money, only a promise of personal fulfillment. A dream.</p><p>It turned out to be the most rewarding decision I have ever made.</p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>Before you read on:</strong></em> we are running a fundraising campaign in December with a 30% forever discount for new paid subscribers. We are aiming for 1000 members, and we are halfway with 550 currently.</p><p>■■■■■▢▢▢▢▢ 55%</p><p>Every new paid subscription will contribute to the following milestones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>600 paid subscribers → Exclusive mini-course (Q2 2026)</strong></p><p>The topic of the first mini-course will be “Mathematics of Machine Learning”.</p></li><li><p><strong>700 paid subscribers → Another exclusive mini-course (Q4 2026)</strong></p><p>A second mini-course with a different expert/angle. The idea is to slowly build an extensive “course library” for members.</p></li><li><p><strong>800 paid subscribers → Dedicated Manim animator</strong></p><p>We’ll bring on a <strong>Manimator</strong> so more articles come with clean, high-quality animations that make the concepts instantly click.</p></li><li><p><strong>1,000 paid subscribers → Full-time writer</strong></p><p>This is the big one. With a full-time writer on the team, we can ship <strong>more deep dives, more courses, and more structured learning tracks</strong> throughout 2026.</p></li></ul><p>If you upgrade now, you’re not just supporting what exists today; you’re helping shape what we can build next year.</p><div><hr></div><p>Back in early 2021, most of the machine learning community was active on Twitter, and I enjoyed spending time on the platform, feeling the pulse of the tech world. So, it was a good place to start writing online. (We are living a different life now. COVID, the war in Ukraine, and Trump: Season ...</p>
