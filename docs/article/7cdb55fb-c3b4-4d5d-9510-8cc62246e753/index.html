They said they had proposed to Iran a brief extension on the matter, but had yet received no Iranian response:</p><blockquote><p>Direct negotiations between Iran and the US must resume urgently. The E3 stand ready to support this process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To this end, the E3 have offered Iran a limited extension of the relevant provisions of UNSCR 2231, in exchange for Iran resuming negotiations and addressing some of the international community’s most immediate concerns regarding· the transparency and extent of its nuclear programme. To date, the offer put forward by the E3 has remained unanswered by Iran.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Such an extension would be granted to provide additional time for negotiations with the aim of concluding a new agreement, while maintaining the possibility of resorting to the reestablishment of relevant sanctions against Iran to prevent nuclear proliferation.</p></blockquote><p>U.S. officials have anticipated that snapback will be triggered if there is not a more robust show of Iranian willingness to address western concerns. They have also pressed Iran for direct talks. </p><p>Iran’s Araghchi said Wednesday that Iran did not yet see the conditions for “effective” negotiations with the United States.</p><p>"In my opinion, we have not yet reached the point of maturity where effective negotiations with the U.S. can take place," Araghchi <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-moment-effective-nuclear-talks-with-us-not-reached-2025-08-20/">said in remarks</a> reported by Iranian state media.</p><p><em>Update Friday Aug. 22, 2025</em>: French Foreign Minister Barrot Jean-Noel Barrot <a href="https://x.com/jnbarrot/status/1958878948890194430?s=61&amp;t=8ajOAkN9LQ_NZJJQCFBh2g">reported</a> on the call on Twitter:</p><blockquote><p>With my colleagues @DavidLammy, @AussenMinDE, and @kajakallas, we just had an important call with our Iranian counterpart regarding the nuclear program and the sanctions against Iran that we are preparing to reapply.</p><p>Time </p></blockquote>...</source>
