        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Mary Shelley&#039;s mother as an &#039;18th-century English radical&#039; but doesn&#039;t elaborate. Wollstonecraft was a pioneering feminist philosopher who wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and died shortly after giving birth to Mary Shelley, profoundly shaping her daughter&#039;s life and work.</p>

Joseph Merrick&#039;s life as a Victorian-era man with severe physical deformities who became a celebrity and object of both exploitation and sympathy directly connects to Jefferson&#039;s analysis of Jackson and American &#039;freakshows.&#039;</p>

I have a few more audiobooks of Judith Newcombe Stiles’ <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9798892422437">Hush Little Fires</a>, </em>narrated by her daughter actress Julia Stiles, to give away.

Eman won the Arab American Book Award in 2022 and has written for the Washington Post, USA Today, and many other publications. </p><p>And, now, what to read if …</p><h1><strong>You Want to Know About the Woman Behind </strong><em><strong>Frankenstein</strong></em></h1><h3><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/yours-creature-jessica-cuello/7403008173a84cdc?ean=9781737513438&amp;next=t">Yours, Creature by Jessica Cuello</a></strong></h3><p>I must have read Mary Shelley’s gothic horror classic <em>Frankenstein</em> in college, because I have a decades-old Penguin Classics copy, complete with browning sticky notes on which I scribbled cryptic messages to myself. For example: “creature relates history of De Laceys (what’s point?).” But honestly, I can’t remember reading it. And as for film adaptations (director Guillermo del Toro’s is the latest), I’ve only really seen Mel Brooks’ incredibly ridiculous and funny <em>Young Frankenstein</em>.</p><p>Still, I love the story behind the story: The novel’s origin as a ghost story told to a group of friends in a Swiss villa. Shelley’s fascinating biography as the daughter of 18th-century English radicals Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin, and as mistress, then wife, then widow of Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.
