        <p>Hello, and welcome to the fourth edition of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on McLennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. Waco Cant Wait’s inaugural month has been very humbling, and I am so excited for what the new year holds. In the meantime, I am looking forward to my two weeks of rest with my Wife, my Family, and my Schnauzer. </p><p>So that y’all can be prepared, I do not plan on releasing a full newsletter on December 26th (the day after Christmas). Joe Manchin willing, I do not anticipate anything newsworthy to happen over the next week. Instead, <strong>I will be releasing Waco Can’t Wait’s first interview!</strong> </p><p>A couple of weeks ago, I had the chance to speak with Victoria Volker, a queer pastor and Co-Founder of Lady Justice House, an LGBTQ+ centered congregation in Waco. We spoke about her coming into her queer and christian identity, the challenges of starting a new church community, and what role the church can play in supporting LGBTQ+ youth in a state that is increasingly hostile towards their existence. </p><p>Finally, in a county as tough as McLennan, Democrats and Progressives need to think about the most efficient way to organize our efforts to get maximum results. A good way to do this is to set a goal, and for many that goal is to flip McLennan County blue. I would like to argue that this isn’t the best way to conceptualize how our time should be spent, and I will argue that we should be working towards more attainable short-term goals that are instrumental to eventually flipping McLennan County. But first, let’s look at the news!</p><h4>Week in review (a collection of news from Waco, Texas, and beyond)</h4><p><strong>Waco:</strong></p><p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year, and not just because the holidays are right around the corner. <strong><a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/mondays-filing-deadline-solidifies-waco-political-season/article_b28b0b7e-5c57-11ec-92d8-6bc8d2f67ac3.html">The deadline for candidates to file for partisan offices closed this last Monday</a></strong>, and we can now see the landscape of Democratic Candidates running for office<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. Looking to the local seats with Democratic challengers:</p><ul><li><p>Cuevas Peacock, Director of Community Relations at Baylor University, will face off against Cedric Davis, Marlin’s City Manager, in the Democratic Primary for Texas House District 13. </p></li><li><p>Erin Shank, a Waco bankruptcy attorney and Democratic activist, is challenging incumbent Republican Charles “Doc” Anderson for Texas House District 56.</p></li><li><p>Precinct 2 County Commissioner Pat Miller will </p></li>...</ul>
