          <strong>Gerrymandering</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly mentions &#039;radical gerrymandering&#039; as a key factor making legislative seats uncompetitive and pushing politicians toward their base rather than centrist voters. Understanding the history, methods, and legal battles around gerrymandering would help readers grasp why education reform dynamics differ so dramatically between states.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Massachusetts reformers working to pass &#039;a science of reading bill&#039; and later mentions &#039;knowledge-rich, book-rich ELA instruction&#039; behind the &#039;Southern Surge.&#039; This is a specific pedagogical movement with decades of research behind it that readers may not fully understand.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions Chad Aldeman arguing for &#039;a second Thomas Jefferson high school&#039; in Fairfax County. This elite magnet school has been at the center of major debates about gifted education, admissions policies, and equity - directly relevant to the article&#039;s themes about education reform battles.</p>
