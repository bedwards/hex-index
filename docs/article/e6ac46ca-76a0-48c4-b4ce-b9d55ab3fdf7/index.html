        <h3>“I did not know that I could only get the most out of life by giving myself up to it.”</h3>
<hr>
<p><em>“One must know what one wants to be,”</em> the eighteenth-century French mathematician Émilie du Châtelet wrote in weighing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/01/03/emilie-du-chatelet-fable-of-the-bees-preface/">the nature of genius</a>. <em>“In the latter endeavors irresolution produces false steps, and in the life of the mind confused ideas.”</em> And yet that inner knowing is the work of a lifetime, for our confusions are ample and our missteps constant amid a world that is constantly telling us who we are and who we ought to be — a world which, in the sobering words of E.E. Cummings, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/09/25/e-e-cummings-advice/">“is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else.”</a> Try as we might not to be blinded by society’s prescriptions for happiness, we are still social creatures porous to the values of our peers — creatures surprisingly and often maddeningly myopic about the things we believe furnish our completeness as human beings, habitually aspiring to the wrong things for the wrong reasons.  </p>
<p>In 1926, more than a decade before a team of Harvard psychologists commenced <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/23/harvard-grant-study-robert-waldinger-ted/">history’s longest and most revelatory study of human happiness</a> and half a century before the humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm penned his <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/23/erich-fromm-the-art-of-living/">classic on the art of living</a>, the British psychoanalyst and writer <strong>Marion Milner</strong> (February 1, 1900–May 29, 1998) undertook a seven-year experiment in living, aimed at unpeeling the existential rind of all we chronically mistake for fulfillment — prestige, pleasure, popularity — to reveal the succulent, pulsating core of what makes for genuine happiness. Along her journey of “doubts, delays, and expeditions on false trails,” which she chronicled in a diary with a field scientist’s rigor of observation, Milner ultimately discovered that we are beings profoundly different from what we imagine ourselves to be — that the things we pursue most frantically are the least likely to give us lasting joy and contentment, but there are other, truer things that we can train ourselves to attend to in the elusive pursuit of happiness. </p>

<p>In 1934, under the pen name Joanna Field, Milner released the results of her inquiry in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Ones-Own-Marion-Milner/dp/0415550645/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>A Life of One’s Own</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/life-of-ones-own/oclc/432998373&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — a small, enormously insightful book, beloved by W.H. Auden and titled in homage to Virginia Woolf’s <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/15/virginia-woolf-androgynous-mind/"><em>A Room of One’s Own</em></a>, published three ...</p>
