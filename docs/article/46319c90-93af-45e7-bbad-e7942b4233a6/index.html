        <p>We’ve been pulling on the chiplet thread, lately exploring why chiplets matter and what it takes to build a thriving ecosystem:</p><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.chipstrat.com/p/the-long-arc-of-semiconductor-scaling">The Long Arc of Semiconductor Scaling</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.chipstrat.com/p/chiplets-and-the-future-of-system">Chiplets and the Future of System Design</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.chipstrat.com/p/building-the-chiplet-ecosystem">Building the Chiplet Ecosystem</a></p></li></ol><p>This week at OCP, Arm made an interesting <a href="https://newsroom.arm.com/news/arm-sets-the-standard-for-open-converged-ai-data-centers">chiplet announcement</a>: it’s contributing an <strong>architecture-neutral, vendor-agnostic chiplet spec</strong> called the Foundation Chiplet System Architecture to the Open Compute Project. </p><p>To unpack the story behind this, I spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moawad/">Mohamed Awad</a>, GM of Arm’s Infrastructure Business. Our 25-minute conversation covers:</p><ul><li><p>How Arm fits into power-constrained AI datacenters</p></li><li><p>The state of chiplets beyond vertically integrated designs</p></li><li><p>Why Arm first created its own chiplet specification</p></li><li><p>What led to the architecture-neutral Foundation specification</p></li><li><p>What the Foundation specification defines versus what it leaves open</p></li><li><p>Why Arm contributed the Foundation spec to the Open Compute Project (OCP)</p></li></ul><p>Keep reading for the lightly edited transcript.

I want to get to your current role, but first, can you share a bit about your background? I saw that you’ve been on the Arduino board, you spent time at Broadcom and you even worked on Zigbee at Ember. So a great mix of compute, connectivity, system design. Tell us more.</strong></p><p>MA: Thanks Austin. Great to be chatting with you. I started as a software engineer. I had this concentration in data communication. So I always loved it. For a couple years I worked at those old infrastructure companies – Lucent, Nortel – and did some of that.</p><p>I went on to work at a little startup that was working on mesh networking because I thought wireless was cool. This was back in the early 2000s and that took me to Europe for a while and then eventually took me to Broadcom where I got to do all sorts of fun stuff, everything from Bluetooth and Wi-Fi through to GPS and I even started a custom ASIC business there which went on to build custom ASICs for the likes of Apple.</p><p>In 2018 I joined Arm, I went back to my infrastructure roots and have gotten into the compute side of things in a big way. It was a great time to join. Obviously Arm has been on a quick trajectory since 2018 within infrastructure and excited to have played my ...</p>
