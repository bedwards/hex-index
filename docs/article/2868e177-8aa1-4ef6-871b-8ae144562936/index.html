        <p class="topic-summary">The article laments the death of negative criticism and the shift toward forced positivity in cultural commentary. Pauline Kael exemplifies the era of passionate, uncompromising film criticism the author seems to mourn—she was famous for her scathing reviews and willingness to hate popular films.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article critiques Stranger Things for being &#039;dependent on references so meaningless&#039; and built on a &#039;plainly false vision of American social life.&#039; The show is fundamentally a nostalgia product for 1980s culture, and understanding nostalgia as a psychological and cultural phenomenon illuminates why such media resonates despite its flaws.</p>

As Sanneh points out, music reviews went from involving of a lot of passionate crankiness and meanspirited takedowns to being among the most tepid and uncontroversial of all culture writing. He names some likely causes, many of which boil down to the fact that the internet is an insane place run by insane people; negative criticism of K-pop essentially doesn’t exist, for example, because K-pop fans are lunatics who will attempt to ruin or end your life if you criticize their favorite artists, and for some reason we tolerate that as a culture. Sanneh goes easier on poptimism than I would, but there is at least some recognition that poptimism is the overarching problem - the directive to give pop music more respect has devolved, in 2025, into a politicized demand that pop music never be criticized at all. It’s a good piece, so check it out if you haven’t.</p><iframe class="spotify-wrap podcast" data-attrs="{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a73bc3a90a03948fd76fc622b&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;When Did Music Critics Get So Nice?&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;The New York Times&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Episode&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/2ObtEMXAGMC1vHQ7j7nrdQ&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;noScroll&quot;:false}" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/2ObtEMXAGMC1vHQ7j7nrdQ" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen="true" allow="encrypted-media" data-component-name="Spotify2ToDOM"></iframe><p>The podcast conversation includes a lot of great discussion, and a few odd moments. (Morris takes a really gratuitous and unfair swing at Hilton Als, but, <a href="https://fivebooks.com/book/anxiety-influence-by-harold-bloom/shareimage.jpg">you know</a>.) The most glaring thing for me is one that you see often in such discussions: when they do talk about poptimism, Morris and Sanneh turn the conversation immediately to hip hop, almost every time. This is odd - surely poptimism is mostly about pop, not hip hop - but it underlines the animal spirits underneath the debate; hip hop remains cooler than pop music, which is certainly notable in this particular context, and also here the not-entirely-comfortable intersection of racial politics with arts criticism surely plays a role. But mostly, while I enjoyed the conversation and thought it was energizing, I found myself depressed by what didn’t happen: these two professional critics did not, at any point, forcefully defend the idea that negative criticism is valid, important, and necessary in an unqualified way. I kept hoping, but it never happened. And the music media reaction to Sanneh’s essay involved far more fulminating and performative allyship than defenses of negative criticism among the music reviewer class. Those guys just do not want to </p>...</source>
