The first time I read this novel it didn’t strike me as particularly noteworthy, and it certainly did not seem to elevate to a work that was communicating a profound philosophical message or series of themes. But I returned to this book after a surprising comment from my philosophical mentor Alain Badiou; he once wrote that it is the “best manual” for how courage produces the subject in his <em>Theory of the Subject </em>(1980). Badiou takes this even further and cites<em> The Red Badge of Courage</em> as one of the best examples of the theory of the event. This is high praise for such a seemingly modest and unambitious novel. It thus only made sense that I read the book again and in doing so I discovered what all the fuss is about. </p><p>In Badiou’s account, the novel not only describes what an event is, it offers up an account of courage that is distinctly Sophoclean. It is not common that we think of Sophocles as a figure of virtue ethics but Badiou cites Hölderlin’s short commentary on <em>Oedipus </em>and <em>Antigone</em> as opening an entirely new window into the importance of Sophocles. Similarly, in <em>After Virtue</em>, Alasdair MacIntyre juxtaposes Aristotelean to Sophoclean conceptions of the virtues in the following way. For Aristotle, courage is bound up with the Homeric conception of courage as a form of glory bestowed on the soldier who acts courageously for the sake of his household and his community.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> To act courageously is to bring a b<em>alance </em>to the wider community and to affirm one’s place in the wider society. This is how we can understand Aristotle’s wider notion of the virtues, they are based on a balancing of the Golden Mean. In the case </p>...</source>
