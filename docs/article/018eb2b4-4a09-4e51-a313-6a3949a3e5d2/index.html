But this is in truth only a recent imposition (over the past 800 years or so). The correct French word is <em>goupil</em>, while <em>renard</em>, though written today in lowercase, is really a proper name, of Germanic origin. <em>Reinhard </em>or <em>Reinhardt</em> in turn has sometimes been glossed in popular etymology as “Pure of Heart”, though the truth is you just can’t get <em>hardt</em> from <em>Herz</em>,<em> </em>and the real meaning is something more like “strong in counsel”<em>. </em>It is however difficult not to read the name from the point of view of modern German, as a pairing of two attributes, <em>rein </em>and <em>hart</em>: “pure-hard”, or perhaps “so hardcore”. And curiously, given that the English <em>core</em> derives ultimately from the Latin <em>cor</em>, we seem to have arrived back where we started. </p><p>The fox anyhow is supposed to be, in medieval Europe as in Indigenous North America and elsewhere, the consummate trickster. While this is a character profile that we may naturally associate with hard-heartedness, it is much more difficult to link it with <em>pure</em>-heartedness, unless perhaps we draw inspiration from Kierkegaard and conceive such purity as belonging to any being who<em> wills only one thing</em>. Renart, the protagonist of Europe’s greatest animal epic —the medieval template for <em>Tom and Jerry</em> and <em>Itchy and Scratchy</em> and basically everything else in that venerable mode of imagining, through anthropomorphism, a comic and ultraviolent fun-house-mirror world parallel to our own— is plainly pure-hearted in at least this sense. He wills, namely, nothing but <em>harm</em> to those around him (perhaps with the exception of his dear wife and friend, the vixen Hermeline), and nothing but ill-gotten gains for himself. </p><p>This might be Kierkegaard’s fox but it is not Tolstoy’s or Isaiah Berlin’s: Renart does not waste his time sniffing around, now at this, now at that, but thoroughly digs in, like Tolstoy’s hedgehog, to the one thing that matters to him: pure malice. </p><p>Just how malicious is Renart?
