        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly references the 25th Amendment as a mechanism for presidential removal due to incapacity. Understanding its history, provisions, and the few times it has been invoked would provide crucial context for evaluating the author&#039;s arguments about Trump&#039;s fitness for office.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Susie Wiles&#039;s role as Chief of Staff is central to this article, particularly her function as a &#039;failsafe&#039; managing a president who allegedly doesn&#039;t understand his own agencies.

Fear not, I’ve done the work for you. </p><p>Below you’ll find the most damning revelations, interspersed with my own comments. They are ordered <em>as they appear in the story</em>. The article bounces back and forth in time, so these aren’t strictly chronological, but they do trace the arc of the second Trump presidency pretty neatly.</p><p>As you read, bear in mind that the Democratic Party leadership holds the view that House Democrats should not support privileged resolutions of impeachment.</p><h1>PARDON WHOM?  </h1><blockquote><p>On Trump’s <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-claims-divine-mandate-in-dark-inaugural-address?srsltid=AfmBOoo9iM-WvjrCioqVmPH_2ntDYTxONZ8v-Wm_SSQYPOBZnarpUW0z">first day in office</a>… Trump issued pardons to almost everyone convicted in the bloody January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, in which nine people ultimately died and 150 were injured. Even rioters who’d beaten cops within an inch of their lives were set free. (Fourteen people convicted of seditious conspiracy had their sentences commuted.) </p><p>Did she ever ask the president, “ ‘Wait a minute, do you really want to pardon all 1,500 January 6 convicts, or should we be more selective?’ ”</p><p>“I did exactly that,” Wiles replied. “I said, ‘I am on board with the people that were happenstancers or didn’t do anything violent. And we certainly know what everybody did because the FBI has done such an incredible job.’ ” (Trump has said his FBI investigators were “corrupt” and part of a “deep state.”) But Trump argued that even the violent offenders had been unfairly treated. Wiles explained: “In every case, of the ones he was looking at, in every case, they had already served more time than the sentencing guidelines would have suggested. So given that, I sort of got on board.” (According to court records, many of the January 6 rioters pardoned by Trump had received sentences that were lighter than the guidelines.)</p></blockquote><p>As <em>Politico</em>’s Kyle Cheney <a href="https://x.com/kyledcheney/status/2000942988982411668?s=20">notes</a>, Whipple’s final corrective here significantly understates the truth, and thus provides Wiles with a false alibi. Basically <em>nobody</em> who tried to overthrow the government was sentenced to serve more time than the guidelines recommended. Her </p>...</source>
