        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly references the 25th Amendment as a mechanism for presidential removal due to incapacity. Understanding its history, provisions, and the few times it has been invoked would provide crucial context for evaluating the author&#039;s arguments about Trump&#039;s fitness for office.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Susie Wiles&#039;s role as Chief of Staff is central to this article, particularly her function as a &#039;failsafe&#039; managing a president who allegedly doesn&#039;t understand his own agencies. The history and evolution of this powerful but unelected position would illuminate the unusual dynamics described.</p>
