The Hamas officials were reportedly meeting in Doha to discuss a new U.S. proposal to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.</p><p>“I am not thrilled about it. I am not thrilled about the whole situation,” Trump told White House pool reporters as he entered a Washington seafood restaurant tonight a block from the White House, accompanied by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, and other White House officials.</p><p>“We want to get the hostages back,” he continued. “But we are not thrilled about the way that went down today.”</p><p>Did Israel tell you in advance, a reporter asked him.</p><p>“No,” Trump said, shaking his head.</p><p>Was he caught by surprise?</p><p>“I’m never surprised by anything, especially when it comes to the Middle East,” Trump said.</p><p>“I’ll be giving a full statement tomorrow.
