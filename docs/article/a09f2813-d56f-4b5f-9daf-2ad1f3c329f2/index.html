      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I was reminded of Arthur C. Clark’s famous third law the other day, that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” I’d recently gotten <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview">Claude Code</a> set up on my computer, and was using it to help write the code for some <a href="https://docs.fairmodel.net/en/latest/">reduced-complexity climate model</a> runs. Suddenly projects that would have taken hours or even days were running in minutes. It was not perfect –&nbsp;I needed to carefully help it create projects plans, develop tests, and review the results – but it represented a remarkable step up from the capabilities I was familiar with in past web-based LLM interfaces.</p><p>I’m something of an unusual climate scientist as, rather than working in academia, my main role is as the climate research lead at <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, a financial technology company in Silicon Valley. As such, I’ve probably used AI far more than most other folks in the scientific community, given that we are strongly encouraged to use it extensively for work. I’ve also worked directly with AI labs on projects to evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering climate science questions, and to help enable AI tools to support scientific collaboration.</p><p>I started using GPT3.5 back in 2022 when it first came out. Initially it was a novelty but not particularly useful for scientific applications. It was quite prone to hallucinations, would get into endless spirals of errors it would then try and fix, and would often grossly misinterpret instructions. But it had decent skill at coding, and could (sometimes) help solve bugs in my code much faster than trying to search Stack Overflow or old Reddit posts.</p><p>This changed with the release of GPT4 in 2023, and particularly with the release of Code Interpreter that could automate data analysis and visualization capabilities. It still hallucinated, was not great at writing, but could arguably code better than the typical scientist. One of the earlier projects I did was to ask it to help visualize how unusual the summer of 2023 was in terms of global temperatures, which helped generate both the ideas of and code for this somewhat <a href="https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/visualizing-a-summer-of-extremes">viral Climate Brink post</a> (which I referred to as “gobsmackingly bananas” at the time).</p><p>Today the tools are much better than they were in 2023. Hallucinations still exist, but they are much less frequent. As someone who has used these tools more than most in the scientific community, I have a good sense ...</p>
