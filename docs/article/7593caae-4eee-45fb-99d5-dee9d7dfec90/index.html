        <p>The end of daylight saving time, marking the close of summer, is an event that can both disturb and delight. In the autumnal switch that signals the return to standard time, our afternoons speedily sink into darkness, and the days suddenly seem shorter, even though the number of hours in each remains the same.</p><p>On the day the clocks move back, we gain an extra hour. Yet some of us may find ourselves in a kind of latent jet lag, waking up for days afterward on the ‘old time’, discovering an additional hour in the morning that wasn’t there before.</p><p>What, then, does one do with an extra hour?</p><p>The clocks always move on a Sunday because it’s the least disruptive day of the week.

Clocks did not exist until the 14th century. Daylight saving time is observed in selected parts of the world, with about two-thirds of countries choosing to simply carry on as they are. </p><p>In <em>The Order of Time</em>, Italian physicist and writer Carlo Rovelli described how, in the past, life was not ruled by clocks, but by local rhythms:</p><blockquote><p>“The usefulness of clocks supposedly resides in the fact that they tell the same time. And yet this idea is also more modern than we might imagine. For centuries, as long as travel was on horseback, on foot or in carriages, there was no reason to synchronise clocks between one place and another. There was good reason for not doing so. Midday is, by definition, when the sun is at its highest. Every city and </p>...</blockquote>
