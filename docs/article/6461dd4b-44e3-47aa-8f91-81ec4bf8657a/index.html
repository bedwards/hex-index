        <p>Why are birth rates plummeting across the developing world? Why should we even care about low birth rates?

Jesús is one of the most wide-ranging economists in the business today, but today we’re going to focus on the economics of fertility and falling birth rates. Jesús, I want to start by asking you, from an economics point of view, why should we care about declining birth rates, given that we don’t think that smaller countries are necessarily going to be poorer than richer countries? Why do we think that declining birth rates are a problem?</p><p>Jesús Fernández-Villaverde: Like everything in economics, low fertility is a complex phenomenon that has good things and it has bad things. I don’t want to give the impression that everything is bad; there are also some good aspects to it. But mainly, when you have fertility rates that are really very low <strong>–</strong> think about South Korea around 0.7, China slightly above 1, Spain or Italy around 1.2 <strong>– </strong>what you face is a big demographic cliff: a fast decline in population unless you have large flows of immigrants. That has consequences for total GDP growth.</p><p>There are many important aspects in society, such as social security payments or ability to service public debt that depend on the total size of GDP. It’s not as much that we want to have a large population per se, but that we have made commitments in the past in terms of social security benefits and in terms of public debt that depend on the total size of the population.</p><p>Sam Bowman: Imagine if we were a ...</p>
