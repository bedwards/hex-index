        <p>Hi Everyone,</p><p>We had an excellent turnout for our discussion of Venezuela last week—and an excellent discussion. So perhaps you might like an invitation to tomorrow’s conversation, too. </p><p>We’ll be returning to the Middle East, where we’ve just begun our exploration of the Arab Spring. We have an especially interesting guest tomorrow: Adnan Hadad will be joining us to discuss the Syrian revolution, the civil war, the fall of Assad, and the future of Syria and the Middle East. He’s unusually qualified to discuss the Syrian revolution: He was a Syrian revolutionary. </p><p>When it began, he was working as a wealth manager for HSBC in Dubai. Here is how he describes his decision to join the revolution:</p><blockquote><p>… I believed that if people had a chance to speak and be heard, peacefully, common sense would prevail. I’m not saying I was wrong, but I sure didn’t realize back then it would mean we’d have to fight a war against Assad, ISIS, Iran, Russia and God-knows-how many militias who poured into the country from all over the world, all at the same time.</p><p>I started with a project to get funding to purchase satellite phones and other telecommunications equipment that I arranged, surreptitiously, to be transported to Syria with truck drivers. I quickly realized, though, that this was a pitifully inadequate solution.</p><p>That’s when I had the idea of starting a media organization in Aleppo. So in September 2012, I co-founded the Aleppo Media Center, with six other people. The center was the most significant group delivering high-quality reporting about events in Aleppo—until Russia destroyed the city in 2016. The center also filmed The White Helmets, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 2017. I also co-founded Radio Hara, a local radio station in Aleppo, and Lamba Media Productions, a local production house.</p></blockquote><p>You’ve read his work here before. He’s the author this unbearably prophetic essay:</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;b93e4f0b-79ca-4786-b43d-72b8a3d7a276&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Adnan Hadad joined the Syrian revolution because he wanted to live freely in his own country.
