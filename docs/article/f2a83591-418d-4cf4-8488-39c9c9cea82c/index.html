        <p><em>In this week’s newsletter you’ll find everything you want to know about my <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/we-are-the-union/paper">new book</a>, including how to get a 30% or a 50% discount, upcoming book launches nationally, internationally, and in NYC, some fancy blurbs, as well as an excerpt from the book’s introduction. But first, a few words about why I think We Are the Union can help provide some hope in our current (bleak) moment.</em></p><h3><strong>Hope in Tough Times</strong></h3><p>So many people since Trump’s election have told me they feel like going into political hibernation. I get the sentiment, especially after witnessing month after month of heartbreaking <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/01/gaza-biden-genocide-israel-iraq">genocide</a>, combined now with the recent spread of devastating wildfires. But succumbing to despair is exactly what those in power would like us to do.</p><p>Even in the last week we’ve seen some big wins. Internationally, there’s finally a ceasefire (at least for now). And yesterday it was announced that the United Auto Workers has <a href="https://x.com/UAW/status/1882116690722664588">succeeded</a> in defeating Stellantis’ push to move thousands of union jobs abroad. We know from history, and from <a href="https://jacobin.com/2019/04/red-state-revolt-review-teachers-strike">recent experience</a>, that the tide can quickly turn when large numbers of workers come together to fight back.</p><p>It <em>is </em>possible to defeat the billionaire <a href="https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1882194360164561257">broligarchy</a>. But with the Democrats in disarray and other liberal institutions seemingly resigned to Trump 2.0, we shouldn’t expect much help from above anytime soon. Fortunately, despite a more hostile political context, the labor movement <a href="https://www.laborpolitics.com/p/labors-resurgence-can-continue-despite">still has</a> the momentum, resources, and latent disruptive power to expose Trump’s sham populism, beat back his attacks on America’s <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/deportation-immigration-trump-profits-fear">most vulnerable populations</a>, and overcome our bosses through ambitious workplace organizing.</p><p>With that goal in mind, I’m very excited that my new book <em><a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/we-are-the-union/paper">We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big</a> </em>is coming out on February 18 with UC Press. It’s full of inspiring stories about working people building power at work and winning big. At the same time, the book tries to lay out a compelling (and rigorous) case for how to scale up unionization by the millions, through concertedly inspiring and training scores of rank-and-file leaders. This definitely won’t be easy. But it’s necessary. And it’s our best bet to reverse economic inequality, isolate Trumpism, constrain the US war machine, and prevent climate catastrophe.</p><p>Even for regular readers of this newsletter<em>, </em>there’s lots of new research data, analysis, organizing tips, and stories in the ...</p>
