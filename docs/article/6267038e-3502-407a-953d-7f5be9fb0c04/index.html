        <p><em>The following is a guest post from <a href="https://substack.com/@thecathybyrd">The Cathy Byrd</a>, a creative nomad, writer, podcaster and recent Peace Corps Response Volunteer in Moldova. You can follow her <a href="https://thecathybyrd.substack.com">Substack “The Cathy Byrd Project” at this link</a>. </em></p><p><em>A quick disclosure: this article is about members of my family. I’m sharing it because I think Cathy captures a rich story about Moldova’s new culinary scene, but readers should be aware of the personal connection.</em></p><p>Given my lifelong roaming, you might not know of my lasting desire to feel at home wherever I go. Truth is, I’m not a traveler collecting countries. I never set out to be a stranger in a strange land.</p><p>Quite the opposite. I’m always angling to stop and stay a while, to linger, make friends, live like a local. Curiosity leads my search for the authentic. I seek out a sense of genuine warmth—a welcome that recognizes, embraces and transcends my foreignness. If I’m lucky, I reach that sweet spot wherever I go.</p><p>My latest bout of wanderlust took me to Chișinău, the capital city of Moldova. I moved there for a 9-month teaching project with the US Peace Corps Response program. Completing an intensive on-boarding program, learning my way around, beginning classes at university, and settling in twice (housing placement having taken two tries) took most of my attention for the first two months. I was still hard at work getting my balance on the cold winter night that I found myself welcomed into Casaroz, a cozy establishment only steps from my flat.</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/995d4d63-c566-4647-8539-5cd159490918_500x562.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47344e38-6b9e-4e4c-8727-cb901f46d2b3_500x667.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8be4339-336a-4b78-867e-4f984beedb7f_1167x1129.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a7bb8bf7-b561-4f8e-b702-82c723937f5f_1166x880.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95a9be1e-581a-45d8-ae39-c45aad612b3f_1170x1169.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Victor with house cat at Casaroz, 2022, a taste of Casaroz, spring 2025, Instagram posts&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fc402138-897b-47d0-a9fa-37ef6c5fcd46_1456x1210.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p><strong>Victor</strong></p><p><strong>The young entrepreneur that creates this warm sense of place is Victor Savcenco. </strong>The eldest of 4 children recalls his tender years: <strong>“</strong>As a big family, a beautiful tradition that we all valued and loved was dinner. It was a time that we all loved spending together. The food we shared resonates as a core memory of happy times. I think that our childhood memories motivate us.”</p><p>Victor left his home country behind for the first time as a teenager. A foreign exchange student in high school, he stayed on to attend college in California—achieving a business degree that led him into real estate and beyond, even as far as a taco truck venture. All the while, he remembers, he was dreaming…about going home and opening a wine bar.</p><p><strong>Homecoming</strong></p><p>On July 17, 2025, Victor and I sit down for a ...</p>
