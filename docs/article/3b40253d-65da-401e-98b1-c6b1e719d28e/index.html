          <strong>Orange Revolution</strong>
          <span class="read-time">9 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election where Viktor Yushchenko was poisoned and ultimately won after protests against electoral fraud. This was the Orange Revolution - understanding this pivotal moment provides essential context for Ukraine&#039;s democratic struggles and its historical resistance to Russian-backed candidates.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Yushchenko&#039;s poisoning during the 2004 election as an example of Russia&#039;s ruthless tactics. His story - including the dioxin poisoning that disfigured his face - is a dramatic real-world example of the stakes involved in Ukrainian elections and Russian interference.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article identifies Tymoshenko as one of Ukraine&#039;s most divisive political figures whom the consultant helped craft an image for, including her iconic crown braid. Her complex political career spanning corruption scandals, imprisonment, and multiple bids for presidency illuminates Ukraine&#039;s turbulent post-Soviet political landscape.</p>
