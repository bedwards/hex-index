        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">This story is clearly a dark homage to/commentary on the 1988 film that pioneered the concept of cartoon characters (&#039;toons&#039;) living alongside humans in Los Angeles, with similar themes of cartoon-human legal conflicts and noir atmosphere</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The story explicitly names its cartoon realm &#039;Anthropomorph&#039; and features anthropomorphized animals (deer in suits, pig cops, Chief Toad) - understanding the history and psychology of anthropomorphism enriches the satirical elements</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The story&#039;s references to celluloid smell and ink blood evoke traditional animation techniques - rotoscoping was the key technology that allowed realistic human-cartoon interaction in films, directly relevant to the story&#039;s premise of humans entering cartoon worlds</p>

He assumed that it was simply some dumb animal who was not familiar with cars or what they could do to them, and had blundered onto the road.</p><p>He was right, but only after a fashion.</p><p>It was such an animal, a white-tailed deer, in fact. But it resembled a man in appearance and bearing, with a vertical spine and hooves that protruded out of its body like arms and legs. More to the point, it was wearing a carefully tailored suit- not unlike the one Ravenscroft himself was wearing at that moment.</p><p>A closer examination of the corpse revealed the full truth to Ravenscroft. Where red blood should have flowed onto the two-lane blacktop highway, black ink, not visible until it obscured one of the white markers on the road, flowed instead. And the typical fecal smell that occurred when a dead body voided its bowels was replaced by that of several freshly opened cans of paint, along with the equally pungent smell of burning celluloid.</p><p>He could not have known it then, but he was no longer in the world that he knew and understood.</p><p>Instead, he was in a place where simply being a human being would not be nearly enough for him to be treated in the manner to which he was accustomed.</p><p>He had crossed the boundary of the mysterious, unpredictable realm in which the beings his world knew as “cartoon characters” (or, pejoratively, “ ‘toons”) resided. And he was about to discover exactly how much his “kind” were truly “liked” there.</p><p>*</p><p>The first clue that he was in trouble came soon afterwards, when the police, or a facsimile of same,</p><p>drove up in the opposite direction from where Ravenscroft had come.</p><p>Great, he thought. Just what I need.</p><p>By trade, Ravenscroft was a lawyer. He specialized in entertainment law, a natural </p>...</source>
