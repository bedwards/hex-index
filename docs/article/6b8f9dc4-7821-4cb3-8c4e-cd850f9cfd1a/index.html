        <p>We’ve moved from paper textbooks to online textbooks, and now the future seems to be heading towards AI-powered textbooks. South Korea is leading the way, working on bringing AI textbooks into their schools. By next semester, their Ministry of Education plans to roll out AI-powered digital textbooks (according to the <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/11/113_386016.html">Korea Times</a>). Each school will select one digital textbook per subject, and these textbooks are designed to tailor learning to each student’s pace and understanding. Teachers will also get access to data-driven insights to help create more customized learning experiences for their students. While AI-powered textbooks can help modernize education, some teachers worry that too much digital use could harm students’ literacy and creativity and could exacerbate the inequality gap between socioeconomic groups.</p><p>In addition to AI creating more personalized experiences within textbooks, it can also make textbooks more accurate and precise through a process called “knowledge engineering.” According to <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/opinion-the-time-has-come-to-reimagine-college-textbooks-for-the-modern-digital-era/">The Hechinger Report</a>, knowledge engineering is a process that maps the relationships between concepts and logical definitions, ensuring consistency across a textbook. It helps authors ensure that all concept definitions align and identify any missing key concepts within the textbook. Digital tools powered by knowledge engineering can act like "concept-checkers," similar to spell-checkers but designed for the logic and content of a textbook, catching errors that human authors might miss.</p><p>AI is transforming the way we create, consume, and engage with textbooks, offering new opportunities to expand how we learn and interact with information. In this week’s newsletter, we’ll explore some of the latest AI tools and resources to help you stay ahead of these exciting developments.</p><p><strong>Here is an overview of today’s newsletter: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Recap of our recent webinar on “AI vs Academic Integrity: From Bans to Best Practices”</p></li><li><p>Latest Google Tools for Creating Videos, Study Guides, and Learning Aids</p></li><li><p>Teachers' Perspectives on the Use of AI in the Classroom</p></li><li><p>An Interview with Chris Agnew, Director of the Generative AI in Education Hub at Stanford University</p></li><li><p>Exploring the Potential Dangers and Pitfalls of Students Using AI Tools</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>🚀 Practical AI Usage and Policies</h2><h4>⭐️ AI x Education Webinar - <strong>AI vs Academic Integrity: From Bans to Best Practices</strong></h4><p>Generative AI is transforming how students approach learning, raising crucial questions about its role in education.
