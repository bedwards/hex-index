        <p>Do you want to know what the biggest under-reported story of the year is in the Russo-Ukraine War? Its actually easy to pinpoint if one wants to be honest, but at the same time it is deeply uncomfortable to discuss for those states who say they support Ukraine. And that story is that Russia’s allies, most ominously China (the largest producer of military weaponry in the world) are piling in with support for Russia while Ukraine’s allies too often dither (or in the case of the USA, basically cease giving Ukraine aid altogether).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg" width="1179" height="780" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:780,&quot;width&quot;:1179,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Russia’s New Decoy Drone is Made Entirely of Chinese Components&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Russia’s New Decoy Drone is Made Entirely of Chinese Components" title="Russia’s New Decoy Drone is Made Entirely of Chinese Components" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YrQ6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F22a16098-4ff5-46aa-bd4d-0a4b5a14fc49_1179x780.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://militarnyi.com/en/news/russia-s-new-decoy-drone-is-made-entirely-of-chinese-components/">A “Russian” decoy drone used in one of the nightly attacks on Ukraine—only its made entirely of Chinese parts.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>China has always possessed the innate economic, productive ability to transform the Russo-Ukraine War. China can make weaponry or much needed economic goods for Russia at a scale that Russia could not hope to match and which could overwhelm Ukraine. The first piece I wrote specifically about this appeared in February 2023, not long after this Substack was launched. In that piece I tried to warn people about China’s potential ability to transform the course of this war.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;0199ceab-c931-4aac-b3e4-e492578e12a1&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Thanks to everyone for their feedback. This was the choice of two-thirds in the poll, and its a question that I think is terribly important.

Chinese manufacturing is a whole different beast from Russia’s and if Beijing decided to really turn on the taps, they could supply a wide range of weapons and supplies that could kit out the Russian army for years. It makes a long-war possible.</em></p><p>Now, under the Biden Administration, the Chinese always supported the Russians, but were careful to keep that support within boundaries—which makes the developments since Donald Trump has become president much more ominous. While Trump has slashed US support for Ukraine, he has also empowered other states, particularly the Chinese, to dramatically increase their support for Russia. </p>
