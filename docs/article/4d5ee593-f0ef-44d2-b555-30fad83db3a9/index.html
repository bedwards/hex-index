(Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p>DONALD TRUMP ON THURSDAY rolled out what he is calling “The Great Healthcare Plan” and the single most important thing to know about it is that it’s not really a plan.</p><p>A real plan would have details and numbers, plus experts on standby to explain and defend it. It would reflect weeks of behind-the-scenes work, and represent the beginning of a serious, persistent effort to get a bill through Congress. That is not what the White House produced.</p><p>The online <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The-Great-Healthcare-Plan.pdf">summary</a> is just 350 words and fits on a single printed page. The extended “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-calls-on-congress-to-enact-the-great-healthcare-plan/">fact sheet</a>” clocks in at just 825 words. There are days Trump writes more than that in his posts on Truth Social.</p><p>And it’s not like those 825 words are dense with policy substance. About a third is a summary of some modest—er, “historic”—executive actions Trump has already taken. The rest is a list of ideas either Trump or Republicans in Congress have endorsed before, with no guidance on the specifics that it would take to turn them into legislation.</p><p>It’s hard to know what kind of effort went into this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2026/01/15/trump-healthcare-plan-aca/">proposal</a>; probably there were some knowledgeable, diligent wonks at the Office of Management and Budget or the Domestic Policy Council staying up late recently to craft and vet the document’s language. But the reaction on Capitol Hill was a collective shrug, which suggests the White House didn’t spend much time coordinating with the people whose input and support would be necessary to pass a health care law.</p><p>“It doesn’t appear to have done anything positive,” <a href="https://www.mwe.com/people/debra-curtis/">Debbie Curtis</a>, a principal at the health care lobbying and consulting firm McDermott+, told me. “If Congress wants to tackle health care, they have to think through what they want to do. This doesn’t help them do that.”</p><p>None of this is surprising. Trump has been promising to release plans for “great” health care throughout his two presidential terms, going back to the very first days of his initial campaign when he was launching his crusade to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “I am going to take care of everybody,” Trump boasted in a 2015 CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/">interview</a>. “Everybody’s going to be taken care </p>...</source>
