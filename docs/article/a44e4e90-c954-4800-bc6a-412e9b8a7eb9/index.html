Also known as Ultimate, the sport is <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-how-a-flying-disc-sparked-one-of-canadas-fastest-growing-sports/">growing rapidly in popularity</a>, blending intense competition with a culture that prioritizes community, mutual respect, and conflict resolution. Many Ultimate communities that I have known have been aware and committed to justice and progress in society. Although it will <a href="https://ultiworld.com/2022/08/10/ultimate-dropped-from-los-angeles-2028-olympics-consideration/">not be included</a> in the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, it may be an event in Brisbane in 2032.</p><p>The World Beach Ultimate Championships (WBUC)  tournament is happening in Portimão, Portugal until November 22nd. It’s a huge calendar event for the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF), the global governing body of Ultimate and Beach Ultimate. The Algarve region is a gorgeous seaside venue for the tournament bringing together skilled Beach Ultimate players from all over the world.</p><p>According to the WFDF website, the federation seeks to “promote and protect the <em>Spirit of the Game</em> of flying disc play”. This is an informal code that embeds self-regulation of rules (there is no official) joy into play, and reminds players that no one ought to intentionally break rules. Many clubs and communities across the world accept and incorporate this sense of integrity and respect of the sport and opponents. Ultimate is a global game that comprises over 126 member nations. It is a global movement and appreciated all over the world. </p><p>These guiding principles of humanity, equality, and accountability are generally understood—so imagine the shock of discovering that active Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers are participating in this WBUC tournament. </p><p>Just months after the world’s leading academics and genocide scholars declared that Israel is, in fact, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/1/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-scholars-group-says">committing genocide </a>in Gaza, the World Flying Disc Federation decided to permit Team Israel to participate. Palestinian have yet to tally the bodies still buried beneath rubble or account for missing persons.</p><p>A tournament is meant to celebrate athleticism </p>...</source>
