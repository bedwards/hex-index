My apologies to those I’m leaving out. I can’t keep up.</p><p>Yet, Fuentes continues to expand his reach. There’s always a platform willing to host him, at least for the time being. For the past four years, it’s been Rumble. If Rumble ever grows tired of him, history suggests his next landing spot might benefit from his presence. One could argue he exemplifies the case against de-platforming. If you ban him, people will still come to see what he says. A sample includes:</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;179964d9-b2d6-4580-91b5-2adf407ec77d&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>This video is what Coleman Hughes calls “Rumble Nick,” who, in a recent <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/coleman-hughes-the-two-faces-of-nick-fuentes">piece</a> in <em>The Free Press</em>, theorizes that Fuentes plays a “double game” to infiltrate American culture. Hughes writes that the other version of Fuentes is “Podcast Nick”:</p><blockquote><p><em>Then there is the comparatively sane character that Fuentes plays on the podcast circuit. This version of Fuentes is a serious Catholic. He’s clearly read lots of books. He’s earnest; he doesn’t joke or curse much. His vision for the country has much more to do with preserving what he describes as a white suburban American way of life (think Little League baseball and hot dogs on the Fourth of July) than with a hostile theocratic takeover of the federal government.</em></p></blockquote><h4>February 2017</h4><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;736a131b-eae4-4060-b5ee-a427f16d1a93&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p>Fuentes, while a freshman at Boston University, hosts “America First with Nick Fuentes” for the streaming Right Side Broadcasting Network. In the clip above, Fuentes says the First Amendment was “written for Calvinists. It was written for Lutherans and Catholics,” not Muslims and the Saudi royal family. He complains that globalists run the media, calls for the murder of people who run CNN.</p><p>“I want people that run CNN to be arrested and deported or hanged,” he says.</p><h4>August 12-22, 2017</h4><p>Fuentes attends the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., where a woman died after a vehicle plowed through a crowd. Still, Fuentes posts on Facebook that the event was “incredible” and that “the rootless transnational elite knows that a tidal wave of white identity is coming.”</p><p>He then tells the <em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/15/citing-death-threats-year-old-who-attended-violent-rally-won-return/CJU7GioWLClGjIHZ2YqshM/story.html">Boston Globe</a></em> that he won’t return to BU because of death threats he’s received, and that his attendance at the rally doesn’t mean he endorses the white supremacist symbols that were there.</p><p>He proclaims: “I have never advocated violence, never taken part </p>...</source>
