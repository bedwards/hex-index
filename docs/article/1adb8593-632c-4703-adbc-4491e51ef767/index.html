      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Earlier this week, Google made three important announcements. The first is that its AI product Gemini will be <a href="https://x.com/Google/status/2011473056921706852">able to read</a> your Gmail and access all the data that Google has about you on YouTube, Google Photos, and Search. While Google skeptics might see a <em>Black Mirror </em>style dystopia, the goal is to create a chatbot that knows you intimately. And the value of that is real and quite significant.</p><p>Here’s venture capitalist and former Googler David Lieb on how he uses this new automated assistant.</p><div class="twitter-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/dflieb/status/2011482391169417720&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;7 months later, my AI assistant knows ~anything I know, including when my last haircut was. \n\n(Wish it had iMessage access!)&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dflieb&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;David Lieb&quot;,&quot;profile_image_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/profile_images/1294273712418467845/Pf9lWhKl_normal.jpg&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2026-01-14T16:55:48.000Z&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/G-o4kxKbIAAx95Q.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/fElc8Uoujw&quot;},{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/G-o4kxKbsAAn-4D.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/fElc8Uoujw&quot;}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;I desperately want to connect my Gmail, Calendar, and Google Photos to ChatGPT so it can know my life and help me more. \n\nToday’s example: “when was my last haircut?”  \n\nKind of absurd that Gemini doesn’t have this already. What a self own.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dflieb&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;David Lieb&quot;,&quot;profile_image_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/profile_images/1294273712418467845/Pf9lWhKl_normal.jpg&quot;},&quot;reply_count&quot;:38,&quot;retweet_count&quot;:11,&quot;like_count&quot;:186,&quot;impression_count&quot;:113226,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:null,&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}" data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM"></div><p>Google presented a number of different use cases. For instance, a user <a href="https://x.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106">could</a> “Ask Gemini to ‘Recommend tires for my car.’” and it can pull from your photos to “understand your car’s make and model, and even the types of trips you take” and thus make better suggestions. You might ask it to recommend travel destinations or books, or even haircuts. And Google will offer recommendations, along with products and pricing information. </p><p>The second announcement is that Google has cut a deal with Apple to power that company’s Siri and foundational models with Gemini, extending its generative AI into the most important mobile ecosystem in the world. </p><div class="twitter-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Joint Statement: Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;NewsFromGoogle&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;News from Google&quot;,&quot;profile_image_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/profile_images/1972717909559353344/eMJ6AJ0W_normal.jpg&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2026-01-12T17:08:30.000Z&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;reply_count&quot;:1617,&quot;retweet_count&quot;:6569,&quot;like_count&quot;:52818,&quot;impression_count&quot;:10526303,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:null,&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}" data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM"></div><p>The quality of AI is in part a result of data, so the ability of Google to use Apple user data is significant. Already Google, with its existing search, email, maps, online video, docs, auto software, and other products it can use to distribute and capture data, has advantages that make it almost untouchable. Its Gemini product is <a href="https://decodingthefutureresearch.substack.com/p/how-has-the-narrative-around-google">rapidly gaining</a> market share in the generative AI market, similar to the trajectory of its search product in 2002. It’s increasingly an article of faith on Wall Street that Google has won the AI battle, and this Apple deal makes it unlikely anyone else can catch up. </p><p>And the third announcement is that Google will launch a new Gemini-powered ad service and open protocol to create personalized surveillance pricing for merchants across the economy. It is, as Google VP Vidhya Srinivasan said, a way to “offer custom deals to specific shoppers who are ready to buy, without having to extend the same thing to everybody.” Partners <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/?utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nfg&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=">include</a> Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowes, American Express, etc.</p><div class="twitter-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010753651435061704&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;At <span class=\&quot;tweet-fake-link\&quot;>#NRF2026</span>, we introduced our newest tech and tools for retailers to succeed in the new era of agentic commerce, including:\n-Launching the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new ...</div>
