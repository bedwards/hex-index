Those symbols are Resin Identification Codes (RICs). Numbered 1 through 7, they only identify the kind of plastic an item is made of. Far from giving a sweeping assurance that RIC-stamped items are recyclable, the symbol frequently indicates a particular item absolutely <em>cannot</em> be recycled. </p><p>Reluctant to burden citizens with figuring out which plastics are recyclable — a chore that could dampen participation and cause confusion as recyclability of various plastics changes over time — many municipal recycling programs simply encourage people to toss all their RIC-stamped plastics in the bin and let the recyclers sort it out.</p><p>Which ones do recyclers actually want? The most-recycled plastic in America is stamped with a “1,” identifying the item as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). You’ll find it on beverage bottles, cooking oil containers, and many other liquid-containing bottles. A “2” tells you it’s high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Another generally recycling-suitable plastic, it’s used for milk jugs and laundry detergent jugs, and spray-cleaner bottles. </p><p>It’s all downhill from there. Chances are your bin has plenty of #5 — polypropylene (PP) — which is frequently used for single-serve coffee-maker pods; yogurt, butter, prescription pill and soft tofu containers; and the lids on paperboard raisin cartons. Unfortunately, while there’s been a modest recent uptick in recyclers’ interest, polypropylene <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/plastic-recycling-waste-trash-tips-0a606230">generally isn’t being recycled</a> in the United States. </p><p>As for the rest of the RIC spectrum, feel free to make pointed inquiries with your city government, but chances are extremely slim that any <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/climate-environment/plastic-recycling-waste-trash-tips-0a606230">#3, #4, #6 or #7</a> items you throw in your curbside blue bin will be made into anything else. That heap includes lots of packaging, such as non-cardboard egg cartons, fast-food clamshells, styrofoam cups and to-go containers, flexible 6-pack rings and bread bags. </p><p>Feeling a little demoralized? Brace yourself: This blue-bin buzzkill is just getting started. </p><p>Let’s circle back to recyclers’ favorite: #1 PET. Even for this most-favored plastic, much of what’s placed in blue bins isn’t recycled. It’s a question of configuration: Recyclers love clear PET bottles, but most of them don’t want PET when it’s in the <a href="https://blog.icpg.co/is-pet-recyclable-icpg">form</a> of clamshell containers, cups and tubs. In these formats, </p>...</source>
