        <p>It’s been two months since I last wrote, taking a break to focus on my jobs and get through the film festival in October. </p><p>I have always been torn between writing long-form content for Subtack and creating social media content. I had been feeling the pull to spend more time creating content for Instagram, and, as we all know, you just can’t do it all. </p><p>Social media is a torturous relationship for many people, whether it’s doom scrolling, stalking exes, constantly checking how many likes your posts get, or trying to spend less time on it.

I typed "Instagram growth coach" into the search bar and came across someone who didn’t have a big following but was talking about how to make authentic content without burning out. We had a call and she loved my message about beans and encouraged me to share the WHY behind the beans, how did i get here? What is my goal in sharing recipes about beans? Who am I?</p><p>I put together a simple carousel post, see it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPjG-Mmje72/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">here,</a> and it got some love in the first day or two, but by the 3rd day, I was getting hundreds of followers an hour, and the comments were rolling in with so many people who were also passionate about beans and ...</p>
