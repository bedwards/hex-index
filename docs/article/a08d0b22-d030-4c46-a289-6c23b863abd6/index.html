        <p>Welcome to Waco Can’t Wait’s first interview! I am looking forward to releasing more conversations like this that highlight people doing valuable work in Waco and McLennan County. </p><p>Last month, I had the chance to speak with Victoria Volker, a queer pastor and Co-Founder of Lady Justice House, an LGBTQ+ centered congregation in Waco.
