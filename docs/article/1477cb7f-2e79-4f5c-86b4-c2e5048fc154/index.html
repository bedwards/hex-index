Thanks for all the emails with stories about your own experiences in Vegas, with gambling addiction, and with CES in response to my last piece, I read them all and responded to most except the ones pitching me Guaranteed Parlays That Will Hit! Thanks also for subscribing, we’ve jumped a bit and are just shy of 4,400 subscribers. If you like what you’ve read and want to support me further, you can become a paid subscriber for $7 a month or $70 a year. What do you get in return? My undying love, some recommendation posts every now and then, and paywalled essays/rants just as long as this one! Now, let’s get to today’s essay.</p><div><hr></div><p>I have long believed that one of the greatest threats we face is the proliferation of the on-demand labor platform. The so-called “gig economy” is one of the larger altars to greed and misery in our civilization where millions of people are sacrificed in order to grow Smaugian hoards that are then transmuted into this or that form of power.</p><p>My earliest introduction to this was through the work of labor ethnographer and legal scholar Veena Dubal via her law journal article <a href="https://repository.uclawsf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2588&amp;context=faculty_scholarship">“The Drive to Precarity,” </a>which maps out how militant workers turned San Francisco’s precarious taxi sector into a stable line of work, how companies responded with a wave of deregulation and de-unionization that immiserated workers, and how Uber sealed the deal in returning ride-hail to its earlier insecure form: poor working conditions and starvation wages, with every possible cost (healthcare, fuel, maintenance, etc.) offloaded onto workers and consumers.</p><p>Key forms of on-demand labor—namely, ride-hail and food delivery—have proliferated over the past few years, but not because they are particularly profitable or innovative business ventures. <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-thirty-three-uber-isnt-really-profitable-yet-but-is-getting-closer-the-antitrust-case-against-uber.html">Most of them either have no real path to profitability, report dubiously calculated profits, or are operating illegally in hopes of realizing or sustaining them after sufficient lobbying and monopolization and exploitation of consumers/workers.</a> The lazy and incurious view has been that they will grow into profitability, but the transparent reality is that the firms at the vanguard of the gig economy have thrived because they take advantage of a few key phenomena: worker misclassification, algorithmic discrimination, anti-competitive capital-intensive strategies, impressive public relations, robust political lobbying, and </p>...</source>
