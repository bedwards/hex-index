        <p>Marjorie Taylor Greene’s populist insurgency against Donald Trump continues! The former congresswoman told a radio interviewer yesterday that the president’s “Make America Great Again” slogan was “all a lie”: “What MAGA is really serving in this administration, who they’re serving, is their big donors,” she <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5718355-marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-maga-lie/">said</a>. “The big, big donors that donated all the money and continue to donate to the president’s PAC and donate to the 250th anniversary and are donating to the big ballroom.”</p><p>As we keep finding reason to say: When she’s right, she’s right. <em><strong>Happy Tuesday.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2753254,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/i/186735742?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!23BG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420495a2-552d-479a-99fb-94fde45e6678_4000x2667.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">(Photo by Alex Wroblewski / AFP via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><h1>The Era of Trump</h1><p><em>by William Kristol</em></p><p>At the beginning of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/bill-kristol-the-maga-elites-are">Bulwark Podcast</a>, Tim pointed out that it was February 2, aka Groundhog Day. We then had a brief colloquy on our sense that every day in the era of Trump seems like Groundhog Day. It did cross my mind that I might take this moment to pay tribute to former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose one impressive deed in office occurred on Groundhog Day 2014, when he dropped New York’s designated seasonal oracle from his grasp and watched her tumble to the ground and to an <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/bill-de-blasio-2020-is-a-terrible-idea">untimely demise</a>.</p><p>Tim and I moved on to discuss the Epstein files, Trump’s threats to subvert the 2026 elections (about which more below), and other weighty matters. But somehow the distressing notion that Tim and I had mentioned in passing had lodged itself in my mind: that we live in what could be called the era of Donald Trump, and that we’ve done so for quite a while.</p><p>I know that we’ve referred to the “Trump era” many times. But for some reason it struck me anew how long and how historically important this era is. It’s not a blip, a fever that breaks, or a temporary aberration. It’s part of American history—a sizable part.</p><p>Ten years ago, in early February 2016, it was still unclear that Trump would be that year’s Republican nominee. On February 1, he placed second in the Iowa caucuses. But the rest of February featured Trump victories in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. And then on March 1, Super Tuesday, Trump won seven of the eleven contests and was well on his way to the nomination. And then the general election. And then so on, for the next ten long years.</p><p>It’s </p>...</source>
