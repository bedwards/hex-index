I was to speak alongside folks discussing music from Sweden and South Korea.

A post-pandemic evaluation of the government’s Canada Music Fund revealed that revenues are down: album sales fell by nearly 74 percent between 2015 and 2021. And according to data from the City of Toronto, live music venues are disappearing, with the city shuttering 15 percent of these spaces between 2020 and 2021.</p><p>There was an increase in pandemic-related support funding, but also a concern that this funding is nothing but temporary.
