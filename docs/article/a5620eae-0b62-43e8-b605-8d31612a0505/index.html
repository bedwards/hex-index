It’s been a dream setup to report seriously on China, tech, and AI. The fellowship’s training covers both  journalism and the fundamentals of AI, which makes it one of the best on-ramps for people who didn’t come up through traditional reporting or AI pathways.</em></p><p><em>I always thought about tech journalism but assumed I missed my chance after college. Tarbell gave me another shot. ChinaTalk gives me the freedom to chase questions I’m genuinely curious about in the China–AI space, paired with a team that constantly reads each other’s work, shares articles, and brainstorms ideas. You’ll be producing impactful work for a large audience, but you’ll also be learning every day.</em></p><p><em>At ChinaTalk, I spend my time digging into the semiconductor supply chain, Chinese AI models, U.S.–China relations, and whatever else I get excited by. If that sounds like your idea of fun, <a href="https://www.tarbellcenter.org/fellowship">apply</a>!”</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Think Tanks in the Age of AI</h2><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> As the new interim Executive Director of CSET, are you excited to rip up everything they’ve created and remake it in the image of Helen Toner?
