        <p>The last post of the year is usually also the hardest to write because it always feels like it should be deeper, smarter, and more insightful than usual. The good news is that I was able to free myself from these self-imposed expectations, but the bad news is that this post is still going to feel a lot like a reflection of a sort. This has become a tradition: a year ago (gosh, it’s been a full year!) I invited readers to have an honest conversation about the state of cybersecurity, and this time around, I am going to talk about selling security as we go into 2026 and what the market expectations look like.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>This issue is <a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/sponsor">brought</a> to you by… <a href="https://www.tines.com/access/guide/the-security-leaders-playbook-to-grc-orchestration/?utm_source=Venture_in_Security&amp;utm_medium=paid_media&amp;utm_content=primary/1612">Tines</a>. </em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.tines.com/access/guide/the-security-leaders-playbook-to-grc-orchestration/?utm_source=Venture_in_Security&amp;utm_medium=paid_media&amp;utm_content=primary/1612">The security leader’s playbook to GRC</a></strong></p><p>Manual compliance work is costing your team time - and fueling burnout.

I do this pretty often because not everyone understands that<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/making-sense-of-the-cybersecurity"> security is a horizontal, not a vertical;</a> that in security,<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/game-of-thrones-in-cybersecurity"> there is a unique driver of innovation</a> that can’t really be found in any other market except for defense - the adversary, and that for a long list of reasons,<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/why-there-are-so-many-cybersecurity"> everything in our industry relies on trust</a>.</p><p>All this is true, but we’ll never be able to understand the complete picture until we discuss why selling security is different than selling most other products.
