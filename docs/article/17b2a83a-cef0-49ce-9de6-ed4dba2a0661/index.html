        <p>A few days ago, Zohran Mamdani got elected to be the mayor of New York City. Along with new governors-elect Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, as well as elected officials across smatterings of other states, and new Georgia public services commissioners Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, this crop is the latest group with a mandate to do something about the anger Americans feel towards their society. And whether moderate, left-wing, or in-between, most, led by Mamdani, are saying they will do something about it.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png" width="594" height="716" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:716,&quot;width&quot;:594,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:361854,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/178204997?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XBmv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e757c6c-6cc9-45f5-a64f-6175fa7abe7a_594x716.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The challenges facing these leaders are profound, and they are not unique to this moment. In 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024, voters threw the bums out, as the famous statement goes. They are likely to do so again in 2026, this time repudiating Donald Trump. And I think the reason is because most of our leaders are only looking at the public governments, not the private governments - aka commercial monopolies - that undergird them. To take a simple but powerful example, during Covid, it was Apple and Google, not governments, who set public health policy around contact tracing through their control of mobile privacy settings.</p><p>This shadow private governance model, controlled by financiers, is what Americans dislike. Obama and Trump saw this dynamic, and yet despite their anti-establishment political messaging, neither broke with the status quo on its alignment with Wall Street. Similarly, Nancy Pelosi in 2006 ran on Drain the Swamp, a message Trump re-used so effectively few remember Pelosi was there first. In fact, no one in the last 20 years has channeled the rage of voters with sufficient policy courage.</p><p>That’s why one of the more interesting dynamics at work in New York City is that Mamdani brought on anti-monopoly leader Lina Khan as one of his transition co-chairs. There are other signs. Mamdani is apparently going to maintain his political organizing machine, and has even launched a <a href="https://www.transition2025.com/">high-profile</a> resume-gathering operation. (If you’re in NYC and are looking to do something interesting, you should consider applying…)</p><p>These dynamics lead to a question. Is there now a nascent unification of political populism with governing expertise? I don’t want to overstate the argument, since New York City governance is not something I know particularly well, and Mamdani has a whole lot of people giving him advice. We’ll know more when he starts hiring and </p>...</source>
