Really admire what Crosby are up to. This pod was great — on the broken incentives in current service models, the opportunity to refashion business models and entire industries, on the huge opportunity ahead. </p><p><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2IzQkJp2qewOCPMXRQJIsx">Bending Spoons</a>: </strong>Hugely inspirational story.

I enjoyed Hugh White calling AJP Taylor “edgy” — I’m also a big fan of <em>The Origins of the Second World War. </em>I would have asked White about <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/what-ive-been-reading">Pat Buchanan’s</a> perspective as a follow-up. Meta narrative about how conservative history can be as a field and as subject to social pressures as any other endeavour. </p><p>Hugh White is a national treasure. I loved his book <em>How to Defend Australia</em>, which is essential reading. I bought a bunch of books off the back of his <a href="https://josephnoelwalker.com/hugh-whites-strategy-reading-list/">recommendations</a>. He himself is such an Australian intelligentsia archetype — smart, measured, godless, left-of-centre. He is cautious about invoking the Great Man theory of history — then accepts that the decisions that matter really do end up being made in a room with a few key individuals. </p><p>White is scathing of our current crop of leaders, portraying them as totally uninterested in grappling with Australian strategic questions. He basically observes they’re unread and uncurious. Memories of WWII have faded, and these leaders are the children of a post-Cold War world. They know not the sting of stark choices, only the machinations of the news cycle and domestic politicking. </p><p>White calling for Australia to tell Washington that it will not go to war with China over Taiwan is undoubtedly brave. </p><p>It’s interesting that White would inject agency into Australian foreign policy (we did not and need not blindly follow our senior allies, Britain and now America), but rejects agency on Australian identity and demographics. He claims Australia ‘becoming more Asian’ is inevitable:</p><blockquote><p>That’s going to require us </p>...</blockquote>
