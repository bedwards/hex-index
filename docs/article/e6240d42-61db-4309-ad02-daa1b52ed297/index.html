        <p>You ever walk into one of those rooms in a museum, one of the ones far from the entrance of the wing, almost a Random Walk accident of arrival — with your toes tired, your knees achy, coming off a bit of drudgery in the rooms preceding — and all of a sudden the ceiling opens above you and the room expands like a reverse Hitchcock-Vertigo-Jaws-Beach Dolly zoom and those subconscious plans to head kinda in the direction of the where you think the exit is that were forming in the back of your head immediately dissipate and your knees unlock and you feel compelled to stop walking, roll your head around on your shoulders a bit and exhale slowly?</p><p>This might just do that to you.

Here is Miller in 1977’s Mother, China and the World Beyond:</p><p><em>“Even as a boy the name China evoked strange sensations in me. It spelled everything that was vast, marvelous, magical, and incomprehensible. To say China was to stand things upside down.”</em></p><p>Can the purpose of an Asian Wing inside an American Museum be anything but to make one stand in awe of Asia? Are ...</p>
