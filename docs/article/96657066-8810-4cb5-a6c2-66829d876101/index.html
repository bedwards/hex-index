"But like now you're just constantly on edge... if you look at the last 10 summers, I think all 10 of them are in the top 15 hottest from a cooling degree day standpoint."&nbsp;</p><p>While he predicted a slightly above-normal hurricane season for the Gulf Coast this year, he reminded the room: “It doesn't necessarily take a hurricane to cause issues, which I think we're all very keenly aware of.”</p><p>"It sounds to me more like we may have less extreme mega storms, but a lot more storm tantrums,” reflected Kimberly Denbow, vice president of security and operations at the American Gas Association. “Like a little tantrum that causes a big ruckus, which requires preparedness on all of our parts, because clearly there's consequences that come with those as well.”</p><p>Less than a month after that meeting, one of those “storm tantrums” </p>...</source>
