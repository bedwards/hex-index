        <p>I was not originally going to post today. A few data projects and other pieces are behind schedule, and I want to give some attention to the business and book I’m trying to get off the ground before next year. </p><p>Then I read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/us/politics/trump-affordability-inflation-democrats.html">this piece</a> in the <em>Times</em> about how Trump is trying to take back the affordability issue from the Democrats — and I have some thoughts.</p><p>The portion of the article that sparked this post reads:</p><blockquote><p>As Mr. Trump sought to recalibrate his economic messaging after the election, he claimed there was “no inflation,” that gas prices were almost at $2 and grocery prices were “way down.” To illustrate the point, he repeatedly pointed to a report from Walmart showing that the cost of a Thanksgiving meal would be 25 percent less than under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.</p><p>“2025 Thanksgiving dinner under Trump is 25% lower than 2024 Thanksgiving dinner under Biden, according to Walmart,” Mr. Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115503140217634129">wrote in a post on</a> Thursday. “My cost are lower than the Democrats on everything, especially oil and gas! So the Democrats ‘affordability’ issue is DEAD! STOP LYING!!!”</p><p><strong>Mr. Trump risks being in a similar position as his predecessor, defending his record by pointing to statistics that don’t capture a troubling reality that many Americans are feeling.</strong></p></blockquote><p>This all dovetails nicely with what I’ve been writing about economic voting in 2024 and 2025, and has some lessons for 2026/2028. </p><p><em>This extra post is free to read today, but consider becoming a paid subscriber of Strength In Numbers to support more work like this.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Anxiety about “prices” does not just mean inflation</h2><p>The last portion of the <em>Times</em> excerpt above resonates with me as I have recently found myself among a group of political scientists and elections analysts <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gelliottmorris.com/post/3m4z5apofok23">who have argued</a> that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gelliottmorris.com/post/3m52q45qfa22v">high nominal prices</a>, not just annual change in prices (AKA “inflation”) is what <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gelliottmorris.com/post/3m4z3wvt2s22e">sunk Biden/Democrats in 2024</a>. We are opposed in our stance by a group of mostly hyper-online, well-off #posters who attest that the economy was good in 2024 because the rate of inflation was dropping, Biden just lost because the press killed him with negative rhetoric. I say I think the press plays a role, but voters’ economic anxieties cannot simply be hand waved away when <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gelliottmorris.com/post/3m4z5rsjfhc2n">household bills went up 30% </a>during Biden’s presidency.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trumps-big-weakness-is-the-economy?utm_source=publication-search">as I have pointed out</a>, <strong>there is no reason </strong>...</p>
