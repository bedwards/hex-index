I find it quite endearing, interpreting it to mean that they feel safe enough around me that I am now synonymous with a caring family member. While I’m still their teacher, I want my students to know that my care is as much paternal as it is academic. </p><p>However, the first time I heard a student blurt out, “Mister! I need some help!”, I thought it might be a joke. There was no obvious urgency to the request, but her tone indicated otherwise. I walked over and clarified her confusion. Then came a chorus of, “Teacher! Teacher!” from the back of the classroom. <em>Why aren’t they calling me Mr. Neibauer? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@specere/video/7330480496301968683?lang=en">Is this some sort of TikTok challenge</a>?</em> No sooner than I addressed those students, did I hear “Mister! Mister! I need some help!” from another small group of students. I could definitely hear the panic in these students’ collective voices. They obviously needed my help, right away! “Mister” and “Teacher” are new epithets that I have not heard before, or in such number, so I started paying attention to when and how my students asked for help. I noticed an interesting pattern.</p><p>I avoid lecturing my students whenever possible. Yes, I give direct instruction, but I always try to limit my talking to under ten minutes. Any longer, I feel I’ve lost them. When I give directions, I make sure to keep them brief, and provide ample wait time for students to ask clarifying questions. When I’m met with silence, I often ask, <em>What’s a question that someone else might have? What could another student be wondering right now?</em> Sometimes this works; lately, it has not. After direct instruction, or a set of directions for a task students are going to complete, either individually or collaboratively, I ask if there are any questions. I wait, sometimes getting a few clarifying questions. Then, when I set my students to work, 15 hands will immediately shoot up, “Mister! Teacher!” Suddenly, my entire class needs my help at once. </p><p>In K-5 classrooms, the most popular strategy for addressing this issue is <em><a href="https://www.edutopia.org/video/60-second-strategy-ask-3-me/">3 Before Me</a></em>.
