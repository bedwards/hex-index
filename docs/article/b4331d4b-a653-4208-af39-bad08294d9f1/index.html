        <p>Lots of monopoly-related news this week, as usual. A Canadian deal with China shows the world turning against America, Trump nominated a billionaire to run his antitrust policy at the Federal Trade Commision, and Mayor Zohran Mamdani seems to be off to a great start. And a lot more..</p><p>But before getting to all of that news, I want to highlight an important moment on Capitol Hill last week that could dictate the future of finance in America. On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee abruptly canceled its meeting, known as a mark-up, to write little-noticed legislation to deregulate the financial system. And the reason is that two of the more powerful forces in D.C. - the banking lobby and the new MAGA-powered crypto world - came into conflict. The result, so far, is a stalemate. </p><p>I haven’t written about crypto for a few years, because there’s not much to say beyond “they did a lot of bribes in a bribe-prone system.” But depending on what happens next, we could be looking at the end of an iconic American figure, the local banker, and his or her replacement with something very different. The context of the legislative fight is, as you see in lots of other areas, the decline of the productive institutional fabric of America. </p><p>Culturally speaking, banks have a weird place in America, as they are the institutions that control permission to use resources. The endless number of bank heist movies, often with plucky burglars as heroic figures telling bank customers they needn’t worry because it’s not <em>their </em>money at risk, suggests that there’s a lot of skepticism of financial power in general. But there are two types of bankers, the generous local elite and the extractive beancounter. These represent a traditional populist vs oligarch framework. </p><p>Take the holiday classic film <em>It’s a Wonderful Life. </em>It’s about a small town banker named George Bailey, played by Jimmy Stewart. Bailey’s help financing useful things in Bedford Falls, like houses and businesses, contrasts with the avaricious Harry Potter, who is a stand-in for Wall Street. </p><p>There’s a reason for these cultural totems. Americans have always understood that distant control of credit is dangerous, the theme of movies such as <em>Wall Street,</em> <em>Margin Call, </em>and <em>The Big Short. </em>They also see that local control of credit and payments is key to self-sufficiency. Local banks uses to be, and to some extent still ...</p>
