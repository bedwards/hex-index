        <p>A few weeks ago, after I published “<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/using-behavioral-science-to-build">Using behavioral science to build stronger defenses</a>,” one of the readers reached out to tell me that Bruce Schneier had given a talk on a very similar topic many years ago. I was intrigued, so I went digging and eventually found the talk they were referring to. What follows is both a summary of Schneier’s ideas and my own reflections on how they resonate today.</p><p>At the heart of Bruce’s talk lies a simple but powerful insight that security is both a feeling and a reality. The two don’t always align; people can feel secure without actually being secure, or be secure while still feeling insecure. In this piece, I am looking at this disconnect more closely to resurface the ideas from Bruce’s talk, to highlight just how fascinating (and sometimes counterintuitive) human psychology can be, and to discuss how this impacts the way we should be building products.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>This issue is <a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/sponsor">brought</a> to you by… </em><a href="https://events.zoom.us/ev/AoingeLHt_k9DbM2O_-Y5wmgt_YvIL3H9KdYhoA4mQAynOasq6ck~Ahc6Vy5cr6aaEKTVIKjY1HWIdVZ_wQKImJ3fBlyG2RigVGDytLutSt2M_ZeIEJ2Szho51-r-EkDTBc3lwKgL4IW60g">Axonius</a>. </p><p><strong>Fragmented environments.

Since my blog is focused on startups and the future, once in a while, I see people getting confused about why I think that some essay from two decades ago or a video from a decade and a half is relevant today.</p><p>The reason for that is simple: while technology moves quickly, the fundamentals of most industries and we as humans change far more slowly. If you take a few steps back, it becomes pretty clear that the incentive systems, organizational dynamics, and human psychology are remarkably consistent even though the tech we rely on changes. That’s why there are plenty of ideas from a long time ago that feel as relevant today as when they were first published. Nearly two decades back, Ian Grigg described security as a market for silver bullets, and while tech has come and gone since then, and new Gartner categories replaced old ones,<a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/cybersecurity-is-not-a-market-for"> that framing still, in my opinion, describes how our industry works</a>. Similarly, while a bunch of ...</p>
