        <p><strong>The concert of complex planetary patterns continues</strong></p><p>November continues with last month’s planetary configurations in slightly different variations, which means that this month we will be given some time to manage and process the major themes that featured prominently in October. Again, we will see attempts at hammering out a compromise to soothe old wounds of anger and aggression in order to create a protective and nurturing environment (T-square between Chiron in Aries, Venus in Libra and Jupiter in Cancer). If you have planets somewhere around 24° Aries, Cancer, Libra or Capricorn, you are likely to be torn between ‘war and peace’ or ‘me and the other(s)’ in some way.

Those of you who have planetary placements at the beginning of the air sings of Gemini, Libra or Aquarius or at the end of the water signs of Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces could be ‘recruited’ to become part of such a support system - if you are not already engaged in such a venture.</p><p><strong>A time for reflection and soul-searching</strong></p><p>The New Moon together with Mercury and Venus in the last degrees of Scorpio will activate the Grand Water Trine again on the 20<sup>th</sup>, coloring the entire last week in November. With so much emphasis on water and especially on Scorpio, there seems to be a great need, but also a great opportunity for emotional cleansing. It might be good to remember what each of the water signs stand for in the therapeutic process: Jupiter in Cancer reminds us to create or look for a safe and empathetic space in which you can open up emotionally. The New Moon together with Mercury and Venus in Scorpio remind us to dig deep and be brutally honest with our feelings. Saturn and Neptune in Pisces remind us to be ...</p>
