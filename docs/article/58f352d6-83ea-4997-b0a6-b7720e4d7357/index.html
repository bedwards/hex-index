        <p>Companies are approaching AI transformation with incomplete information. After extensive conversations with organizations across industries, I think four key facts explain what's really happening with AI adoption:</p><ol><li><p><strong>AI boosts work performance. </strong>How do we know? For one thing, workers certainly think it does. A<a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insights/the-adoption-of-chatgpt/"> representative study of knowledge workers in Denmark</a> found that users thought that AI halved their working time for 41% of the tasks they do at work, and<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136877"> a more recent survey of Americans</a> found that workers said using AI tripled their productivity (reducing 90-minute tasks to 30 minutes). Self-reporting is never completely accurate, but we have other data from controlled experiments that suggest gains among <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-cybernetic-teammate">product developmen</a>t, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4397280">sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged">consulting</a>, as well as for <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566">coders</a>, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5162111">law students</a>, and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161">call center workers</a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>A large percentage of people are using AI at work.</strong> That Danish study from a year ago found that 65% of marketers, 64% of journalists, and 30% of lawyers, among others, had used AI at work. The study of American workers found over 30% had used AI at work in December, 2024, a number which grew to 40% in April, 2025. And, of course, this may be an undercount in a world where ChatGPT is the fourth most visited website on the planet.</p></li><li><p><strong>There are more transformational gains available with today’s AI systems than most currently realize. </strong><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-end-of-search-the-beginning-of">Deep research reports do many hours of analytical work in a few minutes </a>(and I have been told by many researchers that checking these reports is much faster than writing them); agents are just starting to appear that can do real work; and <a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-jagged-agi-o3-gemini-25-and-everything">increasingly smart systems can produce really high-quality outcomes</a>. </p></li><li><p><strong>These gains are not being captured by companies. </strong>Companies are typically reporting small to moderate gains from AI so far, and there is <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33777">no major impact on wages or hours worked</a> as of the end of 2024.</p></li></ol><p>How do we reconcile the first three points with the final one? The answer is that AI use that boosts individual performance does not naturally translate to improving organizational performance. To get organizational gains requires organizational innovation, rethinking incentives, processes, and even the nature of work. But the muscles for organizational innovation inside companies have atrophied. For decades, companies have outsourced this to consultants or enterprise software vendors who develop generalized approaches that address the issues of many companies at once. That won’t ...</p>
