        <p>Once reserved to the ultra rich longevity clinics or a product only doctors could prescribe to themselves, full-body scans have been gaining in popularity over the last couple of years. New providers and offerings have popped up, and consumer demand for them is rising sharply: last December, there were close to 70K Google searches on terms related to full-body scans. These scans are emerging as a brand new category in preventative medicine, and their democratization is under way — not without controversy.</p><p>Are full-body scans the future of preventative health &amp; early disease screening?

But that’s changing: full-body scans are popping up everywhere, and are being made more broadly accessible.</p><p>Here are the few factors fueling their democratization:</p><p><strong>Product Standardization</strong></p><p>Full-body scans used to be designed very differently from one provider to the next — as they are composed of various factors such as the breadth of organs scanned, the type/quality of machines, time spent screening each organ, etc. However, recent entrants in the industry, such as Prenuvo and Ezra, have revolutionized the process by creating a standardized product that is both ...</p>
