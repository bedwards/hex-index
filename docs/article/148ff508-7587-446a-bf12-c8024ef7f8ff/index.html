He could have easily fought the visible opponents, but the ones he couldn’t contest were the invisible ones who paved the way for the visible ones. It’s like fighting shadows, but shadows won in the end. – Let’s say that logos is the early Greek name for what Lacan, 2500 years later, would call the big Other, in the </p>...</source>
