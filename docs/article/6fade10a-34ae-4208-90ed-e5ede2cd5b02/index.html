Governor</p></li><li><p>Attorney General</p></li><li><p>Comptroller</p></li><li><p>Land Commissioner</p></li></ul><p>We’ve got so much more to cover. I’m still making my list and checking it twice.

Then, over the next 80 days, I’ll write articles about each race. I’ll try to get to them all, but absolutely, I’ll get to the safe blue districts and seats we have a shot at flipping. On top of that, we’ll be doing “Meet the Candidate” articles weekly, but I might increase that to twice a week in January. And the podcast comes back in January. The goal is that we’re all going to know about the upcoming March Democratic primaries and the great candidates running across the state. </p><p>Let’s get into it. </p><h4>State Board of Education (SBOE). </h4><p><a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/the-latest-lone-star-election-chatter-99c">We discussed the SBOE races back in October</a> before filing started. By then, I had heard of candidates who planned to run for Congress, the Legislature, or state or local positions, but I hadn’t really heard about any SBOE races, and I was a little nervous. However, I am pleased to report that we have had many solid Democrats step up. Two of these races may even go to a runoff. </p><p><strong>SBOE05</strong></p><p>This district is in Central Texas and includes Travis and Hays Counties, two blue counties. Needless to say, this will be a safe blue seat for Democrats. That hasn’t stopped Republicans from throwing a candidate up there at the last minute, but a fascist doesn’t have a chance in hell in this district, not in 2026. </p><p>There are five Democrats on the ballot. The incumbent, Rebecca Bell-Metereau, did not run for re-election. Since it is still very early, some candidates don’t have their websites up yet, or I couldn’t find them. <em>Please get them up soon.</em> But luckily, in this race, all the candidates appear highly qualified, and I was able to look up their accolades online.  </p><p>First, you have <a href="https://kevinfortx.com/">Kevin </a></p>...</source>
