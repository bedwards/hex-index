        <p class="topic-summary">This 1942 Supreme Court case dramatically expanded federal power under the Commerce Clause by ruling that a farmer growing wheat for personal use affected interstate commerce. It&#039;s directly referenced in the article and represents a pivotal moment in constitutional interpretation that enabled much of the federal expansion the article critiques.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses the Tenth Amendment as the constitutional foundation for limiting federal power.

        <p class="topic-summary">This is FDR&#039;s &#039;court-packing&#039; plan referenced in the article. Understanding this political crisis explains why the Supreme Court shifted its constitutional interpretation in cases like Helvering v. Davis, which the article identifies as a turning point in federal power expansion.</p>

Having just escaped British tyranny, the people of the separate states that would comprise the proposed union were wary of centralizing too much power at the federal level, and thus sowing the seeds of a new tyranny. </p><p>They therefore set out to create a federal government to which the states delegated only certain limited powers, with all other subjects of governance reserved to the states. </p><p>Those powers — only 18 of them — are listed, one by one, in <a href="https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/handout-c-article-i-section-8-of-the-u-s-constitution?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA44OtBhAOEiwAj4gpOe-Fdsl1Elz2LmjZLJ6oZGIfjd18nEJuFs12sMCtVxjPo20O1MfHWRoCfygQAvD_BwE">Article I, Section 8</a> of the Constitution. They include such things as the power to raise armies, maintain a navy, declare war, borrow money, coin money, establish punishments for counterfeiters and pirates, set standards of weights and measures, secure patents and establish post offices.  </p><p>Reassuring those who were considering the enormously consequential decision of whether to ratify the Constitution, James Madison <a href="https://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendXs4.html">wrote</a>, </p><blockquote><p>“<strong>The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite</strong>. [Federal powers] will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce…The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people.” </p></blockquote><p>To win over those would-be ratifiers who still feared the proposed federal government would undercut state sovereignty and infringe individual liberties, ten amendments were drafted — the Bill of Rights. The 10th Amendment codified Madison’s previous assurance about the division of authorities between the federal and state governments: </p><blockquote><p><strong>“The powers not delegated to the United States by the </strong></p></blockquote>...</source>
