        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Social Security sustainability, demographic shifts, tax rates, and intergenerational fairness. Understanding how the Trust Fund actually works - its mechanics, projections, and the &#039;looming demographic cliff&#039; mentioned - is essential context for evaluating the claims about Boomers preventing reforms and younger generations bearing fiscal pain.</p>

        <p><em>[original post: <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/against-against-boomers">Against Against Boomers</a>]</em></p><p>Before getting started:</p><p>First, I wish I’d been more careful to differentiate the following claims:</p><ol><li><p>Boomers had it much easier than later generations.</p></li><li><p>The political system unfairly prioritizes Boomers over other generations.</p></li><li><p>Boomers are uniquely bad on some axis like narcissism, selfishness, short-termism, or willingness to defect on the social contract.</p></li></ol><p>Anti-Boomerism conflates all three of these positions, and in arguing against it, I tried to argue against all three of these positions - I think with varying degrees of success. But these are separate claims that could stand or fall separately, and I think a true argument against anti-Boomerists would demand they declare explicitly which ones they support - rather than letting them switch among them as convenient - then arguing against whichever ones they say are key to their position.</p><p>Second, I wish I’d highlighted how much of this discussion centers around disagreements over which policies are natural/unmarked vs. unnatural/marked.</p><p>Nobody is passing laws that literally say “confiscate wealth from Generation A and give it to Generation B”. We’re mostly discussing tax policy, where Tax Policy 1 is more favorable to old people, and Tax Policy 2 is more favorable to young people. If you’re young, you might feel like Tax Policy 1 is a declaration of intergenerational warfare where the old are enriching themselves at young people’s expense. But if you’re old, you might feel like <em>reversing</em> Tax Policy 1 and switching to Tax Policy 2 would be intergenerational warfare confiscating your stuff. But in fact, they’re just two different tax policies and it’s not obvious which one a fair society with no “intergenerational warfare” would have, even assuming there was such a thing. We’ll see this most clearly in the section on housing, but I’ll try to highlight it whenever it comes up.</p><p>I’m in a fighty frame of mind here and probably defend the Boomers (and myself) in these responses more than I would in an ideal world.</p><p>Anyway, here are your comments.</p><p><strong>Table Of Contents:</strong></p><p><strong>1:</strong> Top comments I especially want to highlight<br><strong>2:</strong> Comments about housing policy<br><strong>3:</strong> ...about culture<br><strong>4:</strong> ...about social security technicalities<br><strong>5:</strong> What are we even doing here?<br><strong>6:</strong> Other comments</p><h2>1: Top Comments I Especially Want To Highlight</h2><p>…</p><p><strong>Sokow <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/against-against-boomers/comment/189618111">writes</a>:</strong></p><blockquote><p>[The anti-Boomer] take has been imported in part from the EU + the UK where the pension system is not </p>...</blockquote>
