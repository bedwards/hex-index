Before that, he taught at <strong>University of Maryland</strong>, <strong>Georgetown</strong>, and <strong>Towson University</strong>. He loves classic rock and Western, movies, and combat sports. He lives with his wife, a prosecutor, and family at the foot of the Superstition Mountains. He also abides.</em></p><div><hr></div><p><em>I won’t really pay you 10K to sincerely believe in God.</em> But the idea does prompt the following thought experiment:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose Beth <em>sincerely</em> believes that there is no God. However, Sam offers Beth ten-thousand dollars to <em>sincerely</em> believe in God. Would God object to this?</p></blockquote><p>Here we are assuming that God wants people to believe in Him. This is because, among other reasons, He wants a relationship with his creations, namely humans. One cannot have a relationship with someone if they believe that they do not exist. Merely believing that someone exists isn’t enough to ensure that one can have a relationship with them; however, it does look like a necessary component—even if it isn’t enough, i.e., one must believe in someone exists <em>who actually does</em>—of having a relationship with someone is that one believes they exist. One couldn’t, by example, have a relationship with someone if they believed that that person was dead and gone forever, or they never existed in the first place (e.g. Santa Claus). </p><p>The first problem, though, with our thought experiment is that it doesn’t look like people have direct control over what they believe. We cannot, like the flip of a switch, decide we believe that ‘2+2=5’, no matter how much money someone offers us to sincerely believe it. It doesn’t seem possible: we appear to spontaneously believe, without the operation of the conscious will, as to what or whether we will believe. As the philosopher, William Alston (1988) <strong><a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/wpa/DeontologicalConceptionEpistemicJustification.pdf">explains</a></strong>, to think we have direct control over whether we believe something, it would,</p><blockquote><p>[Have] to be true that I have effective voluntary control over whether I do or do not believe that the tree has leaves on it when I see a tree </p></blockquote>...</source>
