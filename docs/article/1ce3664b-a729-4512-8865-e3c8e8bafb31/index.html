        <p>It’s November! Time for us Scorpios to shine.</p><p>This week, we’re talking about <em>falling back</em> (literally and figuratively). From SNAP beneficiaries missing payments on November 1, to falling back on our broken health care system as open enrollment begins, to the time change messing with our health, a lot is shifting. We’re also flying a bit blind when it comes to respiratory disease data, but I’ve pieced together the best snapshot I can from different sources. There’s also always some good news to share! And, finally, we need your help: take a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YLE_GenAI">quick survey</a> to help us learn how you’re using AI tools for health information.</p><p>Here we go!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png" width="1456" height="1087" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1087,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4VyY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd30efca-b039-4d1f-aab5-4c02efda086a_1600x1194.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Hannah (YLE team member) flew to DC last week and went on a lovely run through the national mall, which reminded her of the triumphant moments in our country’s history.

This practice—a polarizing one—has been observed for over a century in an attempt to reduce energy use. In the U.S., most states follow this rule, except Arizona, Hawaii, and some territories. (Hello, Puerto Rico!)</p><p>This isn’t just annoying; there are health impacts:</p><ul><li><p>In the spring, when we lose an hour of sleep and wake up in the dark, our circadian rhythms are disrupted, making it harder to get up and function. Fatal car accidents rise by about 6%, heart attacks spike by 24%, and rates of abnormal heart rhythms and inflammation <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/7-things-to-know-about-daylight-saving-time">increase</a>.</p></li><li><p>In the fall, shorter days and reduced light exposure (sunsets are earlier) are linked to higher rates of <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/fulltext/2017/05000/daylight_savings_time_transitions_and_the.7.aspx">depressive episodes</a>.</p></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508293122">Research</a> shows that keeping <em>one</em> time year-round—either standard or daylight saving—would be healthier. Modeling <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508293122">studies</a> that account for light, circadian effects, and health outcomes suggest that adopting a permanent system could prevent hundreds of thousands of strokes and lower obesity rates. While more evidence is needed, these findings give policymakers a clearer picture of what’s at stake.</p><p>Last week, a bill aiming to make daylight saving time permanent (the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/29">Sunshine Protection Act</a>), authored by Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, and backed by President Donald Trump, was blocked by Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. That means that, unfortunately, without Congressional approval, the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/daylight-saving-time-standard-permanent-where">19 states</a> that </p>...</source>
