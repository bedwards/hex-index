And when you turned on Winter Olympics XXV, more often than not what you saw was . . . curling!?!</p><p>What’s up with that?</p><p>Actually, what <em>is</em> up with that? Why is curling an Olympic sport? It’s true that curling was part of the first-ever Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France, in 1924. On the other hand, it was promptly—and, if I might add, understandably—dropped, and only reappeared in the 1998 games three quarters of a century later. (No offense to curlers everywhere, but maybe it’s time for another curling Olympic time out?)</p><p>Anyway, last weekend’s sports may not have been super thrilling, but the culture war aspects were entertaining. Bad Bunny’s Spanish-language halftime show led Donald Trump to denounce him. And when some of the American Olympians said a few words distinguishing their love of their country from support for the Trump administration, MAGA-types attacked them (more on this below). Samuel Johnson, call your office: Patriotism has become the <em>first</em> refuge of scoundrels.</p><p>Speaking of scoundrels, I’ll note that back here in Washington, D.C., Congress <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-funding-deadline-approaches-ice-reforms/">doesn’t seem close</a> to a deal on the 2026 funding legislation for the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Which is good news. Senate Democrats are actually pretty well positioned for the fight this week. A couple weeks ago, they </p>...</source>
