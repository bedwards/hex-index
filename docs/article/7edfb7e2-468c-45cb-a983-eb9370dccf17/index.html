The tacit, unspoken knowledge embedded in people’s unique experiences can help us make better decisions; the problem is that no centralized planner can access it.</p><p>This “knowledge problem,” as it has become known, is about <em>coordination</em>, not computation. Even today, it can’t be solved by better computers or more data. The solution, as Hayek wrote in “<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a>” (1945), is <em>decentralization.</em></p><p>Markets, in Hayek’s view, aren’t just for allocating resources; they’re information systems. Prices compress local knowledge into signals, align incentives, and create feedback loops that process dispersed information and help society navigate the future. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/podcast/prediction-markets-explained/">Prediction markets</a> make this idea concrete, turning collective knowledge into prices that reflect probabilities. And their adoption is happening at exactly the right time: With trust in institutions reaching historic lows, these systems offer a new kind of credibility that’s built on openness and transparency.</p><p>As DeFi reimagines finance and stablecoins reimagine payments, prediction markets reimagine forecasting, with implications that extend well beyond finance: businesses, analysts, policymakers, and everyone else can use prediction markets to hedge risk, access real-time forecasts, and better prepare for the future.</p><p><strong>Read more on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/investing-in-kalshi/">our investment</a> in Kalshi (<a href="https://a16z.com/announcement/investing-in-kalshi/">also here</a>) or see <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/podcast/prediction-markets-explained/">our explainer</a> on prediction markets and why they matter</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><p><code>GOOD GOVERNANCE</code></p><h2><strong>Which tokens should include governance rights?</strong></h2><p><em>Andrew Hall</em></p><p>Builders often struggle with <em>when</em> — and <em>whether</em> — to give governance rights to tokenholders. A useful starting point for addressing these is going back to the basics: what is governance meant to do, and what can governance help protocols achieve?</p><p>Ultimately not every project needs token voting.
