It makes you paranoid. I have spent the better part of an hour on two-sentence emails in order to phrase something in such a way that it does not expose me to legal action. I am terrified every day of letting something slip by me or messing up or getting caught cutting a little corner in all of the ways that every writer cuts corners sometimes. You never know when one of those things will blow up in your face, when the wrong word or promise will sink a story or sour it after publication. I live in fear of having to issue corrections and I replay the mistakes I have made in my mind over and over again in my head, wincing as if I am in physical pain, when I am lying in bed next to my wife, dead tired but unable to sleep in the wee hours of the morning. It is a fantastic job and I never want to have any other. If I ever fucked up so bad that I lost it, I’m not sure what I would do.</p><p>Fucking up that bad feels like a very real possibility. Different publications have varying sets of hyper-specific “standards” which are often set by lawyers and comically pedantic dorks, but the basic ethics that a journalist should have are pretty simple. Do not write lies. Do not take bribes. Do not plagiarize other work and definitely do not make stuff up that didn’t happen. </p><p>The last two are really the cardinal sins of journalism. If you’re caught doing them it’s basically a guarantee that you will lose your job, and very likely that you will never work in the field again. Those sins receive death sentences for good reason — in committing them, you have indicated that you adhere to none of the very simple ethics of the profession. You have no honor or integrity, and as such should not be trusted to perform the basic function of journalism, which is telling the public true things that will help them understand the world. </p><p>One sin that I didn’t mention is a little more nebulous. You’re not supposed to have sex with your sources or subjects. You’re not supposed to date them; you’re not even supposed to be their friend. This is, </p>...</source>
