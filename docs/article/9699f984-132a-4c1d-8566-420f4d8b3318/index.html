        <p>I was listening with horror to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzMfEsPJn0Q">a Boston City Council meeting</a> today where many council members made it clear that they’re interested in effectively banning autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the city. </p><p>A speaker said that Waymo (the AV company requesting clearance to run in Boston) was <a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=PB55tndgoEr53yBW&amp;t=5300">only interested in not paying human drivers</a> (Waymo is a new company that has never had human drivers in the first place) and then referred to the ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=JY4Y7iWGOBCFQUj6&amp;t=5351">notion that somehow our cities are unsafe because people are driving cars</a>’ as if this were a crazy idea. A council member <a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=yAkJ-4qW0aXgp7-V&amp;t=4636">strongly implied that new valuable technology always causes us to value people less</a>. One speaker <a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=0m4pbUkc5Bfgj_9Y&amp;t=1515">associated Waymo with the Trump administration</a>. There were a lot of implications that AVs couldn’t possibly be as good as human drivers, <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/i/177433705/avs-are-ridiculously-safe-compared-to-human-drivers">despite lots of evidence to the contrary</a>. Some speeches included lots of criticisms <a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=yTQ9IRO3ADoxMXry&amp;t=2679">that applied equally well to what Uber did to taxis</a>, but now deployed to defend Uber.</p><p>Most of the arguments I heard were pretty wildly off-base. Many of the speakers <a href="https://youtu.be/mzMfEsPJn0Q?si=h-JxLjY-IGEVlJfU&amp;t=2183">didn’t factor in the basic safety benefit of AVs to the riders or pedestrians at all</a>, and many of the arguments fell apart when poked at. Here are all my arguments for why a city should legalize AVs, with some concerns at the end:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/i/177433705/avs-are-ridiculously-safe-compared-to-human-drivers">AVs are ridiculously safe compared to human drivers</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/i/177433705/a-transition-to-any-new-safer-mode-of-transit-will-still-involve-people-dying-in-that-new-mode-what-matters-is-the-rates-of-death">A transition to any new, safer mode of transit will still involve people dying in that new mode.
