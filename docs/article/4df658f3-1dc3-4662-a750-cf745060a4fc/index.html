        <h3>Howdy cookbook fans!</h3><p>And welcome to your what-day-is-it-anyway issue of Stained Page News. I hope all of my US readers had a lovely Thanksgiving and didn’t give too much of your money to Jeff Bezos. I for one spent it sleeping off COVID, so this issue will be short but mighty. We’ve got book deals! We’ve got the design in London restaurant cookbook <em><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/3497/9781408890677">Dishoom</a></strong></em>!
