        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Alan Kay as Anjan Katta&#039;s mentor and a &#039;computer legend.&#039; Kay pioneered object-oriented programming, the graphical user interface, and the concept of personal computing at Xerox PARC. Understanding his vision for computing provides essential context for why Daylight Computer&#039;s approach to &#039;good for you&#039; software matters.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;Meditations on Moloch&#039; as &#039;one of the internet&#039;s greatest essays&#039; and discusses multipolar traps. Moloch, the ancient Canaanite deity associated with child sacrifice, has become a powerful metaphor in rationalist circles for coordination failures where everyone loses. Understanding the original mythological context enriches the essay&#039;s core argument about capitalism&#039;s race to the bottom.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central argument hinges on the economic concept of externalities - costs or benefits that affect parties not directly involved in transactions. The essay explicitly discusses how markets fail to account for negative externalities like &#039;brainrot and depression&#039; from social media, and positive externalities from &#039;good for you&#039; software. This economic concept is foundational to understanding the essay&#039;s thesis.</p>

        <p><em>Welcome to the <strong>494 newly Not Boring people</strong> who have joined us since our <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/cable-caballero">last essay</a>!

I want to try something new, which might grow into something bigger. A little seed of an idea, if you will.</p><p>One of the coolest parts of my job is that I get to talk to really smart people who are building products and companies based on the thoughts in their head. Sometimes, I write long essays on these people and their companies. Typically, the easiest way to get their ideas out into the world is by going on a podcast and yapping for an hour. </p><p>But there are a lot of ideas that deserve more than a passing mention on a podcast and less than a 10k word deep dive, and that are better expressed by the person whose idea it is than by me once-removed. </p><p>So I’m playing around with different ways to host those ideas, starting by co-writing an essay with <a href="https://x.com/AnjanKatta">Anjan Katta</a>, the founder of <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/">Daylight Computer</a>, on something he mentioned in passing when we were texting over the weekend. </p><p>If this series sticks around, Anjan will probably be a recurring voice. He’s one of the most original thinkers I know, and happens to be interested in a lot of the same weird stuff I am. I highly recommend his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfieKX25ihE">conversation with Jackson Dahl on Dialectic</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhHfVv1WXR8">video he did with Jason Carman last year</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbEZ-DC0L-g">conversation he had with Mario Gabriele and his mentor / computer legend Alan Kay</a>. </p><p>I will also say that while I’m not an investor in Daylight, I bought one and I use it every day, and if you’re thinking of a Christmas gift for your favorite nerd… <strong><a href="http://daylightcomputer.com">here</a></strong>.</p><p>If you buy one, you might just be supporting a world of much better software.</p><p>Let’s get to it. </p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>Today’s Not Boring is brought to you by… <a href="https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/state-of-the-markets-report/?utm_source=notboring&amp;utm_medium=paid-online-advertising-newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=us-2025-08-aw-tl-na-na-tb-na-na-ig&amp;utm_content=1pr_na_em_cntxt_sub_nobo_v1sotmreport&amp;utm_id=mar-68197&amp;gad_source=7">Silicon Valley Bank</a></strong></h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg" width="1000" height="750" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:269949,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.notboring.co/i/176163532?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QW35!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F957dad9d-882d-4394-b9b3-68cb40069653_1000x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>We are living through of one of the most interesting periods in startup history.
