Reports over the years suggested that these firms typically comply: Google was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/08/01/google-china-search-engine-censorship/">building a censored search engine</a> suited to Chinese demands; <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html">has claimed</a> Facebook developed a censorship app as its entrance requirement to the Chinese market, and Vox accused Apple of succumbing to Chinese censorship demands by <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/10/20908480/apple-china-hkmap-app-censorship-hong-kong-protests-tim-cook">banning an app from its store</a> that had been used by protesters in Hong Kong demanding liberation from control by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p><p>But now the tables appeared to be turning when it comes to U.S. censorship demands and TikTok. Threats to ban or severely limit the Chinese-owned-and-controlled platform from the U.S. have been hovering over TikTok's head through <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/business/trump-tik-tok-wechat-ban.html">both the Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/02/02/tiktok-biden-administration-rules/">Biden years</a>. The most common justification offered for the threat is that TikTok's presence in the U.S. empowers China to propagandize Americans, a concern that escalated along with the platform's massive explosion among Americans. Since early 2021, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/tiktok-was-the-top-app-by-worldwide-downloads-in-q1-2022/">has been the most-downloaded app</a> both worldwide and in the U.S. In August, Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/#:~:text=YouTube%20tops%20the%202022%20teen,six%2Din%2Dten%20teens.">conducted</a> a “survey of American teenagers ages 13 to 17” and found that “TikTok has rocketed in popularity since its North American debut several years ago and now is a top social media platform for teens among the platforms covered in this survey.”</p><p>Concerns over China's ability to manipulate U.S. public opinion were based on claims that China was banning content on TikTok that was contrary to Beijing's interests. Western media outlets were specifically alleging that the Chinese government itself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20883993/tiktok-censorship-china-bytedance-politics">was censoring</a> TikTok to ban any content that the CCP regarded as threatening to its national security and internal order. “TikTok, the popular Chinese-owned social network, instructs its moderators to censor videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">warned </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing">The Guardian</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/25/revealed-how-tiktok-censors-videos-that-do-not-please-beijing"> in late 2019</a>.</p><p>Rather than ban TikTok from the U.S., the U.S. Security State is now doing exactly that which China does to U.S. tech companies: namely, requiring that, as a condition to maintaining access to the American market, TikTok must now </p>...</source>
