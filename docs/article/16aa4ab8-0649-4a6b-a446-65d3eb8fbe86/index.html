That’s the word</strong> that made <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/nate-erskine-smith-cabinet-1.7534597">national headlines</a> this past May, after <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Nate Erskine-Smith&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:8598955,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07211309-fc2b-4cf0-894a-ef8a78f6d050_2048x2048.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;6b9f9781-134b-41e6-97e7-6120c4504484&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> was dropped as a Liberal minister. While the title of Erskine-Smith’s Substack post read, diplomatically, “<a href="https://www.uncommons.ca/p/congrats-to-the-new-cabinet">Congrats to the new cabinet</a>,” media coverage largely zeroed in on a moment in the fourth paragraph: “The way it played out doesn’t sit right and it’s impossible not to feel”—well, you know.</p><p>How <em>did</em> it play out? The story starts back in December 2023, when, as the member of Parliament for Beaches—East York, Erskine-Smith had just come second to Bonnie Crombie in the Ontario Liberal leadership race. He later <a href="https://nateerskinesmith.ca/what-comes-next-2/">admitted</a> on his Substack, <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Uncommons with Nate Erskine-Smith&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:1524264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;pub&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.substack.com/pub/beynate&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa6235e2-64f2-49b2-bfc0-7ecf2a5bd331_512x512.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;6e7688b0-0a52-4547-94d5-662abd5134c3&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>, that it was “tough” to lose such a close race, and that he would be “looking for new opportunities to make a difference”—in other words, not seeking re-election as an MP.</p><p>But plans changed. Nearly a year later, with the Justin Trudeau Liberals at their lowest point, Erskine-Smith was appointed minister of housing, infrastructure, and communities. Weeks later, Trudeau announced his resignation. Erskine-Smith soon endorsed <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/mark-carney/">Mark Carney</a> as the party’s next leader. When Carney took over as prime minister in March, Erskine-Smith kept his post and went on to win re-election in Beaches—East York for the fourth straight time. But after Carney’s victory and the subsequent cabinet shuffle, Erskine-Smith was cut loose.</p><p>“Disrespected” is, of course, one way to look at the situation. In a scathing <em><a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/if-nate-erskine-smith-has-become-a-political-punchline-hes-only-got-himself-to-blame/article_ab25e2bb-3da9-4805-81f9-5714285ab194.html">Toronto Star</a></em><a href="https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/if-nate-erskine-smith-has-become-a-political-punchline-hes-only-got-himself-to-blame/article_ab25e2bb-3da9-4805-81f9-5714285ab194.html"> op-ed</a>, Martin Regg Cohn wrote that Erskine-Smith was “playing the victim in his own political game” and accused him of temper tantrums. Cohn notes that of all the ministers dropped, Erskine-Smith was the only one to complain. Users on X and Reddit echoed the sentiment: no one is entitled to a cabinet post, and no one whines when they don’t get it. That’s show business, baby.</p><p>At the same time, it’s hard not to see it as betrayal when you hitch your wagon to someone else’s, only for them to unhitch it without warning and watch you plunge downhill. Take Chrystia Freeland. She prioritized staying in lockstep with Trudeau for nearly a decade and, as her reward, found herself booted from the finance portfolio. Trudeau offered her another ministry. She declined and quit.</p><p>The relationship between Erskine-Smith and Carney is, of course, by no means comparable to the years-long devotion between Freeland and </p>...</source>
