        <p>In October, I wrote about the potential pitfalls of comprehensive reading tracking in a Reading in Public essay. That comments on that post fascinated me because many of them leap-frogged over the idea of tracking to land on a different woe in the modern reader’s life: bookish social media. Many readers chimed in to suggest that it was all of the literary content they were consuming that was impacting their reading lives, and I was interested to learn more. I opened up a social media survey and almost 300 people participated. Consisting primarily of open ended questions, I’m still making my way through everything you all shared and will gradually be posting more about my findings in the coming weeks and months. </p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:176575816,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://fictionmatters.substack.com/p/reading-in-public-no-87-the-promise&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:33100,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;FictionMatters&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3cS5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f5e86-e426-4dc0-8e35-da246e0431b8_249x249.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Reading in Public No. 87: The promise and perils of tracking our reading lives&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;This summer, I got the following question from a reader:&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-10-22T16:44:15.015Z&quot;,&quot;like_count&quot;:81,&quot;comment_count&quot;:140,&quot;bylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:5760699,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sara Hildreth&quot;,&quot;handle&quot;:&quot;fictionmatters&quot;,&quot;previous_name&quot;:&quot;Sara&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1629aa47-9c00-4301-9026-c7d39e28480b_3019x2635.jpeg&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Educator, English M.A., public reader.

I know I’m not alone in this so I thought this would be a good moment to think about how we as a collective body of readers are letting the internet shape our reading choices.</p><p>Of course, there is a massive disclaimer here that people who responded to this survey are a) readers of this Substack and therefore involved and invested in some form of online literary discourse and b) readers who cared enough about it to fill out the survey.
