But perhaps the greatest meditation on how art serves the soul came more than a century earlier, in 1910, when legendary Russian painter and art theorist <strong>Wassily Kandinsky</strong> (December 16, 1866–December 13, 1944) published <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concerning-Spiritual-Art-Wassily-Kandinsky/dp/1619491532/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Concerning-Spiritual-Art-Wassily-Kandinsky-ebook/dp/B004TOPONQ/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>free download</em></a> | <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/concerning-the-spiritual-in-art/oclc/3042682&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — an exploration of the deepest and most authentic motives for making art, the “internal necessity” that impels artists to create as a spiritual impulse and audiences to admire art as a spiritual hunger.</p>
<p>Kandinsky’s words, penned in the period between the Industrial Revolution and the rise of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2010/02/01/the-century-of-the-self/">the consumer society</a>, ring with remarkable poignancy today. He begins by considering art as a spiritual antidote to the values of materialism and introduces the notion of “stimmung,” an almost untranslatable concept best explained as the essential spirit of nature, echoing Tolstoy’s notion of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/09/09/leo-tolstoy-what-is-art-infectiousness/">emotional infectiousness as the true measure of art</a>. Kandinsky writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>[In great art] the spectator does feel a corresponding thrill in himself. Such harmony or even contrast of emotion cannot be superficial or worthless; indeed the Stimmung of a picture can deepen and purify that of the spectator. Such works of art at least preserve the soul from coarseness; they “key it up,” so to speak, to a certain height, as a tuning-key the strings of a musical instrument.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bemoaning the tendency of the general public to reduce art to technique and skill, Kandinsky argues that its true purpose is entirely different and adds to <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/06/22/what-is-art/">history’s most beautiful definitions of art</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> In each picture is a whole lifetime imprisoned, a whole lifetime of fears, doubts, hopes, and joys. Whither is this lifetime tending? What is the message of the competent artist? … To harmonize the whole is the task of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet, Kandinsky admonishes, the notion of “art for art’s sake” produces a “neglect of inner meanings” — a lament perhaps even more “sad and ominous” in our age of consistent commodification of art as a thing to transact around — to purchase, to own, to display — rather than an experience ...</p>
