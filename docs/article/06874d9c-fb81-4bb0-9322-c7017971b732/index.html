        <p><a href="https://stoney.sb.org/eno/oblique.html?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Hello</a>!</p><p>It’s been a while. I’m sorry. I missed you.</p><p>Since I quit practicing law three years ago, my work life has been a patchwork. I edit, I coach, I do too many things for low or no pay. On days when I get several uninterrupted hours to write, I feel great about my life choices. On other days, I wonder why I gave up health insurance to not write.</p><p>Six months ago, I took on a temporary gig as a Session Editor for the Texas House Research Organization. From January through mid-March I had almost nothing to do. It was nice leaving the house. I enjoyed having colleagues and a space to write besides the three-bedroom house that I share with my husband, two teenagers, a dog and a cat.

Ever since Sine Die, which is a Latin phrase for the last day of session that I recently learned my husband pronounces “Sign and Die,” I keep thinking about that incredibly long scene of Tom Cruise underwater. I’ve been in a submarine at the bottom of an ocean of bills for three months. I think I might have the bends. Where are Haley Atwell’s clingy tank top boobs to nurse me back to health?</p><p>Another reason you haven’t heard from me lately is less about time and more about capacity. I started my job on January 6. My time in Texas government coincided with the first six months of Trump II. It’s not that I haven’t kept reading and writing and thinking about everything that I read in a ...</p>
