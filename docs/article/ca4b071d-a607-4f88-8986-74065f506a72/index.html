        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;fighting against the enclosure of the commons&#039; when describing The Defender&#039;s Almanac. The historical enclosure movement in England, where common lands were privatized, is foundational to understanding anarchist critiques of property and capitalism that permeate this gift guide.</p>

      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I think I’m supposed to be cynical about gift-giving because of how it ties into a culture of over-consumption. But the thing is, I really like Christmas personally and I really like the idea of the amorphous “holiday season” more broadly. I like that December is the month where as many people as can really phone it in at work and barely do their jobs. I like how so many cultures decided that the darkest time of the year is the time we ought to cling to one another and give each other things.</p><p>I could do without the Christmas music. The only acceptable Christmas music is when it is sung by actual carolers or by families at a Christmas party. Recorded Christmas music can go to hell. This isn’t a moral statement, just an aesthetic one.</p><p>And I’m much more into “these are books that meant a lot to me this year” or “here are craft supplies” or “I found this silverware set in a secondhand store and I thought of you” than I am into like, buying each other TVs or whatever. But that sort of goes without saying.</p><p>Anyway, if you’re trying to buy some stuff, I’ve got some suggestions of stuff. I’ll start with things I like and then go into things by me. Most of this is books, which won’t surprise you.</p><h2>Things Not By Me</h2><p><a href="https://www.tangledwilderness.org/shop/p/let-it-be-known-patch">Willem Arondeus Backpatch:</a> Let it be known that homosexuals are not cowards.
