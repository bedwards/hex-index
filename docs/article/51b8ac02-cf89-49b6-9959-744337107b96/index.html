Rachel and I talk about how she, as someone who submitted the manuscript of her first novel without even telling her partner or her family, is handling the sudden explosion of attention, about the pressure she feels to make her next book worthy of this attention, and about her rules when it comes to writing explicit sex scenes.</p><p>The interview has been edited here for length and clarity.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>You can’t share stories from </strong><em><strong>thewalrus.ca</strong></em><strong> on Facebook or Instagram because of Meta’s response to the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-you-might-stop-seeing-canadian-news/">Online News Act</a>, but you can share this Substack article there</strong></h4><div><hr></div><p><strong>How have these few weeks been for you?

It’s been very weird and overwhelming and amazing but kind of still really hard to believe. I can’t believe it’s such a short amount of time, but things have changed so much for me. I mean, just professionally, I’ve definitely kind of levelled up, as an author, to another category, doing things I never thought I would achieve, like the New York Times Best Sellers list. Being invited to a lot of events that usually bigger authors might get invited to. And also getting offered all of my travel expenses paid for—that kind of thing. Before, it’d be more like a “Would you like to come to this convention? It costs $500 for a table” kind of thing. And now it’s “We would like to fly you here and put you up in a hotel and pay you.” And so, it’s just in the last couple of weeks that that’s changed a lot, and obviously, my book sales have gone up a lot, and just generally, everybody is very familiar with my characters and my story, which is a very unusual and amazing feeling.</p><p><strong>When you are at these conventions, even the ones you’re being flown to, and being put up in these hotels, are you still reflexively, like, stealing shampoo and putting soap in your bag and </strong></p>...</source>
