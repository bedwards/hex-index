        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses broken security agreements and treaties between Russia and Ukraine. The Budapest Memorandum is the foundational 1994 agreement where Ukraine gave up nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the US, and UK - directly relevant to understanding the legal and diplomatic betrayals Snyder references.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Snyder discusses how Russian diplomacy works to make countries accept limitations on their sovereignty without realizing it. Finlandization is the Cold War concept of a country voluntarily limiting its foreign policy to appease a powerful neighbor - the exact dynamic Russia seeks to impose on Ukraine.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on &#039;Russian unreality&#039; - deliberate deception in diplomacy. Maskirovka is the Russian military doctrine of deception and denial that extends beyond battlefield tactics into political warfare, explaining the systematic unreality Snyder identifies in the leaked document.</p>

        <p>The history of diplomacy is full of strangeness. Touch the surface of the dusty books and peculiar characters spring forth to demand that their tales be heard. And yet the American diplomacy of the past few days, I believe, will stand out as something peculiarly gruesome -- not simply incompetent, but openly courting national and global catastrophe.</p><p>A document suddenly appeared a few days ago under the inapplicable (and too-often repeated) heading of “peace plan” regarding the Russo-Ukrainian war. It would be more accurately <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/trumps-war-peace/685024/">described</a> as a plan to intensify the war to the profit of a few Russians and Americans. It seems to have produced entirely or mostly by Russians, and then <a href="https://macspaunday.substack.com/p/he-got-this-from-k?r=kwfa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">leaked</a> by a Russian negotiator to an American outlet. It was then claimed by a fraction within the White House, endorsed (sight unseen) by the president of the United States, who insisted (at least at first) that Ukraine had to accept it.</p><p>Since then there have been many denials, denials of denials, and obfuscations.  The scandal will perhaps clarify problems of process in Washington. It is not that we -- America -- are trying to sell out Ukraine. American public opinion is favorable to Ukraine. Republican voters support Ukraine. A majority in Congress supports Ukraine. It is rather that a few Russians and a few Americans have the ability to define as a “peace plan” what is essentially the furtherance of personal economic interests combined with a strengthening of Russia’s capacity for warfighting and a weakening of Ukraine’s. Along the way, it contradicts every major principle of international law and furthers a world dominated by China and its Russian ally.</p><p>This suggests the absence of American statecraft.</p><p>It looks a lot like (details below) that Russians are seeking to bribe Americans to allow Russia to win a war it would otherwise lose. Having allowed Russians in this instance to design our policy, we then rely on our European and Ukrainian allies to serve as a check on us. We (or rather some powerful Americans) scold them for doing what they have to do, not only in their own interests but in ours and in the interest of avoiding general disaster. A</p><p>So much for procedure.</p><p>This document that begins in a Russian unreality. Rather than summarizing what has actually happened, a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the authors work instead to communicate the implicit premises that the war ...</p>
