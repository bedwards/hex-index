        <p>We’ve spent a lot of time examining the problem of construction productivity in the US — the fact that, across a variety of different metrics, construction never seems to get any more efficient (in terms of how much output you get for a given amount of input), or any cheaper. A <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/goolsbee-and-syverson-on-construction">paper I wrote about by Goolsbee and Syverson</a>, for instance, titled “The Strange and Awful Path of Productivity in the US Construction Sector,” looked at a variety of different productivity metrics and found that they all show either flat or declining productivity. By contrast, other sectors (such as manufacturing), as well as the economy overall, tend to show increasing productivity.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png" width="501" height="349.9270687237027" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:498,&quot;width&quot;:713,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:501,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SYhP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc049bdbf-6107-4cc7-9a9b-927f72ff5042_713x498.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Via Goolsbee and Syverson.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Much of our investigations have been focused specifically on the issues of construction productivity in the US. But it’s also worth looking at construction productivity trends in other countries — if other countries are showing steadily improving construction productivity, that may give us ideas for ways to improve US construction productivity. If they’re not improving, by contrast, that suggests that US-specific things (such as various regulations) aren’t what’s holding American construction productivity back.</p><h4>International construction productivity</h4><p>To look at international construction productivity, we can use KLEMS databases, which aggregate productivity statistics for different industries in countries around the world. (KLEMS stands for capital (K), labor (L), energy (E), materials (M), and services (S).) These KLEMS datasets are a bit scattered and not amazingly well-maintained (I had to retrieve a lot of the data from archive.org), but by pulling them together we can assemble construction productivity datasets for dozens of different countries going back quite far:</p><ul><li><p>The EU KLEMS dataset has productivity data for European nations, as well as a smattering of other countries. The <a href="https://euklems-intanprod-llee.luiss.it/">current EU KLEMS release</a> goes from 1995 to 2021, and in addition to European countries also includes the US, the UK, and Japan. Older EU KLEMS releases (I used the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211105161700/http:/euklems.net/">2008 release</a>) go all the way back to 1970, and in addition to the US, UK, and Japan, also include Korea, Canada, and Australia.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.asiaklems.net/">Asia KLEMS</a> has productivity data for Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and India, going from 1980 to 2012.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240809081143/http://laklems.net/stats/result">LA KLEMS</a> has productivity data for several latin american countries, going from 1990 to around 2019.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.worldklems.net/wkdata">World KLEMS</a>, in addition to links to the above datasets, also has links to Canada, Russia, and China KLEMS data.</p></li></ul><p>To calculate </p>...</source>
