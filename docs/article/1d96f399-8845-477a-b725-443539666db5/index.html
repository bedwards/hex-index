Historically, SCDM has been used for vaccines that aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. For example, adults deciding whether to get catch-up HPV vaccines for themselves use this approach, since the benefits may be smaller with age but are still worthwhile for some.

Every year, we have to make an educated guess on what flu strains to include. It’s an art and a science, so sometimes the vaccine formula doesn’t always align perfectly with the circulating virus. However, we live in the Northern Hemisphere, which has an advantage: </p></li></ul>...</source>
