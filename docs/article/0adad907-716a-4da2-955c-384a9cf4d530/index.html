          <strong>Benandanti</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;nightwalking&#039; like &#039;Friulian peasants used to do on their stalks of fennel&#039; - a direct allusion to the Benandanti, a 16th-17th century agrarian cult in Friuli, Italy who believed they left their bodies at night to battle witches. This obscure historical phenomenon adds rich context to the narrator&#039;s metaphor for imaginative wandering.</p>

          <span class="read-time">17 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions &#039;the Jews rounded up at the Vélodrome d&#039;hiver&#039; - referring to the Vel&#039; d&#039;Hiv Roundup of July 1942, when French police arrested over 13,000 Jews for deportation to Nazi death camps. This was one of the largest mass arrests of Jews in France and represents a dark chapter of French collaboration that many readers may not know in detail.</p>

          <strong>Order of the Eastern Star</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The narrator discovers commemorative plates from the &#039;Woodland chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star&#039; with names inscribed along a pentagram. This Masonic-affiliated fraternal organization, open to both men and women, has an interesting history dating to the mid-19th century and uses symbolic rituals that would provide educational context for the article&#039;s themes of Americana and nostalgia.</p>
