In an increasingly orthodox narrative that is perhaps best exemplified by the economist Lu Feng’s (路风) <a href="https://www.sinification.com/p/industrial-maximalism-lu-feng-on">concept</a> of the “complete industrial system”, technological innovation is understood not primarily as the product of nimble minds or freewheeling vision, but as the natural outgrowth of a holistic system in which supply- and demand-side inputs are calibrated for its emergence.</p><p>Echoing the <a href="https://www.sinification.com/p/chinas-ai-path-and-the-needham-question">previously covered</a> analysis by public policy specialist Huang Ping (黄平) that China’s advantage in AI derives from its vast “systemic capacity” and pool of industrial demand, management theorist Sun Xi (孙喜) presents a lucid exposition here of how such an industrial system operates—theoreticall…</p>
