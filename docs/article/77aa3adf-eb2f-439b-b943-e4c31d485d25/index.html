So I deeply and humbly apologize to Yaroslav for writing another politics post. </p><p>In the past week or so, some people have claimed that the wheels are coming off the Trump presidency. For example, here’s <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5640504-trump-white-house-dysfunction/?utm_social_post_id=619447282">Max Burns, writing in </a><em><a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5640504-trump-white-house-dysfunction/?utm_social_post_id=619447282">The Hill</a></em>:</p><blockquote><p>It doesn’t take a political genius to recognize that things are in free fall over at the White House…Defense Secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/pete-hegseth/">Pete Hegseth </a>is facing <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5636737-don-bacon-pete-hegseth-criticism/">mounting Republican criticism</a> over a potentially illegal order to kill the survivors of a Caribbean boat strike. Attorney General <a href="https://thehill.com/people/pam-bondi/">Pam Bondi’s </a>Department of Justice is in disarray after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5634017/grand-jury-rejects-new-mortgage-fraud-indictment-against-new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james">three failed efforts</a> to prosecute former FBI Director <a href="https://thehill.com/people/james-comey/">James Comey </a>and New York Attorney General Letitia James…Trump’s approval rating cratered to a new low of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/699221/trump-approval-rating-drops-new-second-term-low.aspx">just 36 percent</a> in late November following months of open-air dysfunction and his repeated failure to address fundamental problems like <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/rising-living-costs-dim-holiday-012457718.html">rising consumer prices</a>.</p></blockquote><p>It’s true that Trump has had a string of setbacks recently. Indiana <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dealt-major-blow-indiana-senate-rejects-redistricting-added-2-gop-house-seats">rejected Trump’s proposed redistricting plan</a>, which would have used gerrymandering to give the GOP 2 more seats in Congress. The GOP-dominated Indiana state legislature openly defied Trump’s <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5646105-indiana-redistricting-micah-beckwith-gop/">threats to cut off the state’s infrastructure funding</a> unless they accepted the gerrymandering plan. It was a pretty <a href="https://x.com/YAppelbaum/status/1999095964775129183">remarkable act of defiance</a> from state-level Republicans, and could indicate that Trump’s power to bully his own party into line is eroding. </p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats have been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/politics/republicans-special-elections-trump-affordability">performing strongly in off-year elections</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Democrats were declared winners of the Miami mayor’s race <strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/miami-mayor-runoff-election">for the first time in nearly 30 years</a></strong>, winning the race easily by 18 points. And…the party also <strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/politics/georgia-democrat-eric-gisler">flipped a Georgia state House district</a></strong> that Trump had carried by double digits last year…The results in Miami and Georgia were merely the latest in <strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/politics/voter-data-election-stats">a series of ominous signs</a></strong> for the GOP’s electoral picture…Democrats also flipped the mayor’s race in suburban Roswell…Democrats…continue to over-perform in special elections by <strong><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/politics/democrats-special-elections-trump">more than they ever have in the Trump era</a></strong>…when the districts have been somewhat competitive, the results have been strong for Democrats. This year they’ve flipped four state legislative seats that had favored Trump by double digits a year ago…Democrats have now flipped more of these seats in special elections than in any year since 2020, when they won back the presidency.</p></blockquote><p>This presages a </p>...</source>
