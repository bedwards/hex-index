Their primary argument—that electricity price are rising because the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) subsidies for wind and solar were repealed by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)— <em>has zero basis in reality.</em> </p><p>Today, we investigate the motivations behind these bad-faith arguments and give you the tools you need to refute them for yourselves.</p><h1>A Quick Note</h1><p>We are heading into our end-of-the-year fundraising push for our day jobs at <a href="https://www.aoenergy.org/team/">Always On Energy Research</a>. As part of this effort, we’ll be reaching out to our list of <em>Energy Bad Boys </em>subscribers with a fundraising email on behalf of AOER. </p><p>As we note below, there is a <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/electricity-price-politics">massive messaging war</a> right now as wind and solar advocates try to pin rising prices on the rational energy policies being pursued by the Trump administration. We are eager to debunk the arguments and the studies, like this one by <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/report/one-big-beautiful-bill-act/">Energy Innovation</a>, that support them. To do that in detail, we’ll need to raise funds.</p><p>Thanks to all of our readers for understanding. Our steady paychecks from AOER enable us to maintain our side hustle, keeping <em>EBB</em> free for all and consistently delivered to your inboxes on Saturday mornings. There’s no obligation to donate, but you can if you’d like to support our work.</p><h1>The Blame Game </h1><p>According to <em><a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/electricity-price-politics">Heatmap</a></em>, wind and solar special interest groups are escalating their attempts to convince Americans to believe that mounting electricity bills are the result of their representatives in Congress who voted to cut “support” for wind and solar generators.</p><p>First of all, this argument backfires as an indictment against wind and solar projects themselves, as it’s an admission that they are uncompetitive without lucrative subsidies and far more expensive than consumers were led to believe. </p><p>Ultimately, it appears <a href="https://dccc.org/van-orden-and-steil-vote-to-raise-energy-costs-again/">liberal politicos</a> are hoping to make electricity prices the political liability for Trump that egg prices were for former President Biden. According to <em><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5484941-power-bills-trump-gop-electricity-cost-inflation/">The Hill</a>:</em></p><blockquote><p>Democrats are beginning to weaponize the issue [electricity prices] against Republicans, especially </p></blockquote>...</source>
