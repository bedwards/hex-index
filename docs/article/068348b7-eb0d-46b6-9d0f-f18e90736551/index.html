The goal was to support more than 50 to 60 million concurrent live streams during the Asia Cup and Cricket World Cup. These are events that attract some of the largest online audiences in the world. For perspective, before this, Hotstar had handled about 25 million concurrent users on two self-managed Kubernetes clusters.</p><p>To make things even more challenging, the company introduced a “Free on Mobile” initiative, which allowed millions of users to stream live matches without a subscription. This move significantly expanded the expected load on the platform, creating the need to rethink its infrastructure completely.</p><p>Hotstar’s engineers knew that simply adding more servers would not be enough. The platform’s architecture needed to evolve to handle higher traffic while maintaining reliability, speed, and efficiency. This led to the migration to a new “X architecture,” a server-driven design that emphasized flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness at a global scale.</p><p>The journey that followed involved a series of deep technical overhauls. From redesigning the network and API gateways to migrating to managed Kubernetes (EKS) and introducing an innovative concept called “Data Center Abstraction,” Hotstar’s engineering teams tackled multiple layers of complexity. Each step focused on ensuring that millions of cricket fans could enjoy uninterrupted live streams, no matter how many </p>...</source>
