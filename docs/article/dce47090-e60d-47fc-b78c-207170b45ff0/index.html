        <p><strong>I.</strong></p><p>Hating Boomers is the new cool thing. Amazon offerings include <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/A-Generation-of-Sociopaths-audiobook/dp/B01N5VLZNN/">A Generation Of Sociopaths: How The Baby Boomers Betrayed America</a>,</em> the two apparently unrelated books <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1848872321/">How The Boomers Took Their Children’s Future</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541742362/">How The Boomers Stole Millennials’ Future</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boomers-Promised-Freedom-Delivered-Disaster/dp/0593086759">Boomers: The Men And Women Who Promised Freedom But Delivered Disaster</a></em>. “You don’t hate Boomers enough” <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%22you%20don%27t%20hate%20boomers%20enough%22&amp;src=typed_query">has become a popular Twitter catchphrase. </a>Richard Hanania, who has tried hating every group once, has decided that hating Boomers <a href="https://www.richardhanania.com/p/start-demagoguing-against-the-old">is his favorite</a>. </p><p>Some people might say we just experienced a historic upwelling of identity politics, that it was pretty terrible for everyone involved, and that perhaps we need a new us-vs-them conflict like we need a punch to the face. This, the Boomer-haters will tell you, would be a mistaken generalization. <em>This time</em>, we have finally discovered a form of identity politics which carves reality at its joints, truly separating the good and bad people.</p><p>I think these arguments fall short. Even if they didn’t, the usual bias against identity politics should make us think twice about pursuing them too zealously. </p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Why, exactly, are Boomers so bad?</p><p>Zooming out, it seems sort of like Boomers have delivered the greatest period of peace and prosperity in history: global, American, take your pick. The window of Boomer dominance, c. 1980 - 2010, saw the fall of Communism, steadily rising incomes, steadily growing life expectancy, and no foreign wars bigger than Iraq (total American death toll: 4,500). </p><p>The Boomers could reasonably blame their Greatest Generation fathers for sending them to die in Vietnam. Those Greatest Generation fathers could reasonably blame <em>their </em>fathers for plunging the country into a Great Depression. In comparison, we’re mad about - what, exactly? Higher housing prices? Hardly seems World-War-level bad.</p><p>Earlier this month, we investigated <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/vibecession-much-more-than-you-wanted">the Vibecession</a>: the economists’ claim that, despite everyone thinking the economy is bad, actually, the economy is good.
