        <p>Before I get into today’s <em>CONTEXT </em>piece, I want to give a shout out to Edy Poppy, whom I finally had a chance to meet last week when she was in Minneapolis for the Twin Cities Book Fair.</p><p>Although we had been in touch about her book—I recommended reordering one of the stories in <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628976281">Coming. Apart.</a></em>, so that “The Last Short Story” actually opens the collection—and then on a <a href="https://dalkeyarchive.substack.com/p/edy-poppy-and-may-brit-akerholt?utm_source=publication-search">podcast we did with May-Brit Akerholt</a> (I also <a href="https://dalkeyarchive.substack.com/p/reading-edy-poppys-anatomy-monotony?utm_source=publication-search">wrote about</a> <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628972290">Anatomy. Monotony.</a> </em>in a piece about marriage alongside Nina Lykke’s <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948830669">Natural Causes</a></em>), but we had never met in real life.</p><p>Edy’s an incredibly funny person—her account of a Kafka-esque experience with Border Control had everyone cracking up—with an eye for detail and ability to write about emotions and situations others might shy away from. Her work is sharp, uncomfortable (in the best way), provocative, and quite layered. Definitely worth checking out. </p><p>Anyway, hanging out with her—and seeing the first snowflakes of the season—has put me in the mood to read some cold-climate books, especially books from Estonia. </p><p>I’ll write more about John’s history with Estonian literature, our first trip there (which may have saved my life), some of the highlights from the backlist, etc., in a separate post about Rein Raud, but for now, I wanted to bring some attention to, arguably, Estonia’s greatest contemporary writer: <a href="https://bookshop.org/beta-search?keywords=mati+unt">Mati Unt</a>.</p><p>Unt was a giant in Estonian letters, which might sound like the start of a bad joke, but only until you open up <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781564783882">Things in the Night</a></em>, his absolute masterpiece—and the first Estonian book Dalkey ever published. </p><p>This was one of my finds, which arrived from Eric Dickens, a translator from several languages (I forget them all, but I know Dutch was one), who had great literary taste and a lot of wit. He was also an independent scholar, and his piece on “<a href="https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1140&amp;context=clcweb">Literary Translation in Britain and Selective Xenophobia</a>” is an excellent look at the situation of literary translation in the early-2000s:</p><blockquote><p>British publishers, usually themselves incapable of reading books in foreign languages, get around this serious cultural handicap by employing what are termed “publisher’s readers.” In theory, this means that the publisher consults a well-informed adviser to tell him or her what is being published in the world at large. But there are drawbacks. Firstly, there seems to be no clear process whereby a publisher’s </p>...</blockquote>
