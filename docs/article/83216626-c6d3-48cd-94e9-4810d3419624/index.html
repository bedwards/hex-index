        <h2></h2><h3></h3><h3>What City Observatory Did this Week</h3><p><a href="https://cityobservatory.org/basically_the_same_275/">The Interstate Bridge: Spending $273 million to design “basically the same project”</a> as the failed Columbia River Crossing. Over the past 20 years, the states of Oregon and Washington have spent nearly half a billion dollars on consultants to design a bridge and freeway expansion across the Columbia River that it increasingly looks like they will never build. The two state DOTs don’t publish spending data, but we obtained it via a public records request. Since restarting the project a little over five years ago, the DOTs have signed $273 million in consulting contracts.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png" width="388" height="416" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:416,&quot;width&quot;:388,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cCYF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff264afea-3476-49ee-a41a-b4c4dcb84f4f_388x416.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>More than 40 percent of that money has gone to a single firm, WSP. And for the past five years, IBR has been run by a former WSP employee, Greg Johnson--who has recently announced he is resigning from the post at the end of this year. In addition, more than ten percent of the total cost of the project has gone to communications and public relations firms, who have raked in almost $29 million to help sell the mega-project.</p><h3>Must Read</h3><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/magazine/magazine-email/gentrified-neighborhood-ethics.html">The New York Times</a> weighs in on the ethics of gentrification. Neighborhood change is a fraught topic, and people rightly question whether their personal decisions about where to live might affect others. People moving into a new neighborhood, especially a lower income neighborhood, are often castigated as causing gentrification. A recent letter to the New York Times’ ethicist asked “Is It Bad to Buy Into a Gentrified Neighborhood? Kwame Anthony Appiah, the Times’ ethicist, took a strongly empirical view of the question, writing:</p><blockquote><p>Philosophers have the sometimes-annoying habit of asking what words mean. And “gentrification” is a big one. . . . It’s diagnosis disguised as description. Many economists and demographers have come to question the diagnosis. Rising property values do raise rents and insecurity for tenants; longtime owners gain equity but may struggle with higher taxes. Yet studies in Philadelphia and elsewhere found that low-income residents of appreciating neighborhoods weren’t more likely to move than those elsewhere, and when they did, they didn’t necessarily end up in poorer or more distant areas. Nor do eviction rates seem to be higher. Increasingly, researchers see “gentrification” less as a cause than a symptom of housing scarcity and the lag between wages and housing costs.</p></blockquote><p>It’s often difficult to disentangle the actions of individuals from the larger conditions of a neighborhood </p>...</source>
