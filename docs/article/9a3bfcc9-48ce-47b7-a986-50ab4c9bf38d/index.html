        <p>Since launching Missile Matters one year ago, the newsletter has grown to nearly 10,000 followers and consistently attracts between 30,000 and 40,000 monthly views — far more interest in these topics than I had initially anticipated.</p><p>As Missile Matters approaches its first anniversary, I have been reflecting on its future and am excited to announce some additions.</p><p>Most importantly, the website will shift from a newsletter to a platform. This means I will selectively open the space to other voices. In the future, Missile Matters will feature two new publication categories:</p><p>1. Strike Point: A space for established and senior voices to share their perspectives on missile technology, nuclear strategy, and European deterrence.</p><p>2. Launch Pad: A space for junior analysts and scholars to write on the same topics, including those without prior publication experience. I am particularly excited about this category, as my top advice to young professionals and others seeking to enter the field is to publish, though spaces for doing so remain limited.</p><p>I will be highly selective in offering Missile Matters as a venue, both to avoid overwhelming readers with content and because I cannot commit to intensive editorial work. However, if you are interested in writing for Missile Matters, feel free to reach out with a draft.</p><p>That said, if you prefer not to receive emails from the other two publication categories, you can unsubscribe from them individually while remaining subscribed to the main newsletter, which will remain the core of the website. Simply click the ‘unsubscribe’ button at the bottom of the email and select the sections you wish to keep. </p><p>If you only want to receive my weekly updates, simply unsubscribe from ‘Strike Point’ and ‘Launch Pad’.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg" width="328" height="440.3703703703704" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1450,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:328,&quot;bytes&quot;:97143,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://missilematters.substack.com/i/170860889?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NR00!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6e6135d9-ddf2-4d7a-b1dd-8c7b7aa19b8a_1080x1450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In any case, Missile Matters will remain the heart of the website, and outside voices will only be featured occassionally (also depending on interest of course). </p><p>However, I hope you give the other publication spaces a chance, especially Launch Pad. It’s a tough place for junior experts and analysts out there, particularly right now when funding constraints in many countries make it harder to break into the field and publish work.</p><p>Lastly, I am also assembling a comprehensive dataset on conventional long-range strike capabilities, covering all conventional ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and long-range drones across — at present — all 53 countries operating these systems.
