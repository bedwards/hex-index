          <strong>Dred Scott v. Sandford</strong>
          <span class="read-time">1 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly connects the 1831 New Haven vote to this landmark 1857 Supreme Court decision, showing how Judge Daggett&#039;s reasoning was cited by Chief Justice Taney. Understanding the full scope of this case illuminates how local anti-Black actions became constitutional precedent.</p>

          <strong>Nat Turner&#039;s Rebellion</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article identifies Turner&#039;s August 1831 rebellion as the catalyst that transformed white New Haven&#039;s response from indifference to violent opposition. The full history of this uprising and its nationwide psychological impact on white Americans explains the timing and intensity of the backlash.</p>

          <strong>Prudence Crandall</strong>
          <span class="read-time">16 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Crandall as the target of Connecticut&#039;s 1833 Black Law, but her full story—opening a school for Black women, facing mob violence, and being prosecuted—represents another parallel attempt at Black education that was crushed in the same era and region.</p>
