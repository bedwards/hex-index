        <p>I spent September 9 in a cave. It wasn’t planned: I had been promised a waterfall. But there was a long drought, and the streams dried up, leaving a cavern of color and a series of interlocking caves. Cliffs soared above and holes gaped below, beckoning me to explore.</p><p>I waded through wildflowers and entered the largest lair, calling to my husband that I was alright, and crawled as far as I could go. The view from the cave was clearer than the view from the cliffs.  In the dark, every detail of the outside world shines brighter. In the dark, I move slow and gradual, contorting myself to its crevices, observing everything and pursuing nothing. I took pictures because we had stopped at this park on a whim, and it was not supposed to look this way. I had gotten lucky, and I wanted proof that there was such a thing as good luck.</p><p>September 9 was a big day. We had <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/dvorak-lived-in-iowa">dropped our daughter off</a> at college and were taking a detour on a long drive home. The park was a distraction from the pain of leaving our baby behind. </p><p>I’m not giving away the location — if you know from the photos below, <em>shhhh</em> — but I will say that it is an oasis near a highway landscape that even I struggle to make interesting. As a result, I spent the ride back reading the news we had missed.</p><p>“Israel <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/israel-qatar-invasion-gaza-city-1.7631107">attacked</a> Qatar,” I announced. “And <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/10/maps-israel-has-attacked-six-countries-in-the-past-72-hours">bombed Lebanon</a>. And <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/30/yemens-houthis-confirm-israeli-airstrike-killed-the-groups-prime-minister">killed</a> the prime minister of Yemen. And <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/9/21/is-turkiye-israel-next-target-middle-east">threatened</a> Turkey. And slaughtered children in Gaza. <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/on-palestine">Again</a>.”</p><p>It is hard to catch up with all of Israel’s murders and violations of international law in one car ride. Miss one day, miss countless corpses. Israel had <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/10/maps-israel-has-attacked-six-countries-in-the-past-72-hours">attacked six countries</a> in the last 72 hours. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15085039/Israel-air-strikes-Houthi-Yemen-Hamas-Qatar.html">Netanyahu was unrepentant</a>, promising more.</p><p>“Even Trump <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/israel-strikes-hamas-leadership-qatar-133418806.html">condemned</a> Israel,” I informed my husband. “For Qatar.”</p><p>“Trump’s still alive?”</p><p>“Still alive!”</p><p>Trump’s <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/mafia-state-survival-your-questions">alleged</a> demise had dominated “news” for weeks. I use quotation marks because there is no longer “news” in the US: only speculation, propaganda in oligarch-run newspapers, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dark-money-group-secret-funding-democrat-influencers/">dark money posts</a> disguised as articles, the occasional well-researched but paywalled piece, and independent reporting blocked by algorithms.</p><p>The rumor that Trump was dying was sparked by a hand bruise and a dream. It was greeted with celebratory anticipation tempered by thoughts of JD Vance.</p><p><em>If that rumor </em>...</p>
