        <p><em>This series was written in 2012. It was published by </em>Crikey<em>, one of Australia’s last great independent publications. My editor was the wonderful, generous enabler, Jason Whittaker, who let me write whatever I wanted, however I wanted, long after my used-by date had come and gone. <a href="https://www.crikey.com.au/2012/10/24/palestines-street-of-martyrs-paved-with-anger-and-regret/">This piece remains behind the paywall there.</a> But given recent events, and the coverage around them, I thought it might be worth republishing here. The rest of the series is available on the main page of this Substack. All have been very lightly edited.</em></p><p>I return to Ramallah from Taybeh, beer and wine in tow, to find Shehada, the Palestinian violin maker from Bus 18, waiting for me outside the Al-Wehdeh hotel.</p><p>He is here to take me to his home in the Old City, to share iftar, Ramadan’s daily fast-breaking meal, with his family. It is an awkward honour. Only Shehada and his father, an architect, and his incredibly bright seven-year-old sister can speak English, and my Arabic is limited to the point of non-existence. But I am welcomed with open arms nevertheless and by a seemingly endless parade of relatives. Shehada’s mother, sisters, grandmother, aunts, and cousins are all very pleased, or so I am told, that I have come to Palestine for Ramadan. Shehada’s six-year-old brother is very pleased that I’ve come, too, but mostly because he likes strutting around in my aviator sunglasses, pot-belly puffed out and hair slicked back. “Don't worry about him,” Shehada says. “He’s crazy.”</p><p>It is difficult not to notice that there is a gender imbalance around the table: women outnumber men two-to-one. This, Shehada tells me later, stems from the fact that two of his uncles are currently serving time in prison: one for killing Israeli soldiers during the second intifada and the other for belonging to a “radical organisation”. A third uncle has recently been released, on charges that aren’t mentioned, but instead of joining us for <em>qatayef</em> and tea he is slaving away on the second floor of a nearby building, tiling the entryway to his house, which was left to deteriorate while he was away.</p><p>“He has to tile at night,” Shehada says, “because he works as a labourer in Israel during the day.”</p><p>After dinner, fully sated, we move downstairs to Shehada’s work room, where several of his early violins hang on their scrolls from a piece of fishing line, ...</p>
