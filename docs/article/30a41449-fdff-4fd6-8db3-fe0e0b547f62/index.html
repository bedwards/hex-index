        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly compares Rubio&#039;s dual role to Kissinger&#039;s 1973-1975 tenure as both Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. Understanding Kissinger&#039;s controversial legacy, his concentration of foreign policy power, and the historical precedent provides crucial context for evaluating Rubio&#039;s unusual position.</p>

Understanding the committee&#039;s role, its access to classified information, and its recent investigations into unidentified phenomena explains why Rubio&#039;s statements carry particular weight.</p>

(Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Since May of this year, Marco Rubio has served in a dual role as President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor and Secretary of State. The National Security Advisor is the President’s principal in-house advisor on all national security matters, chairs the National Security Council, coordinates the interagency process across the government, and briefs the President daily.</p><p>As Secretary of State, Rubio negotiates treaties, appoints and directs ambassadors, controls the <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-state?fy=2025">$84 billion State Department</a> and USAID budget, oversees 80,000 employees at more than 270 diplomatic posts worldwide, and has direct authority over diplomatic security, intelligence sharing, sanctions enforcement, and emergency evacuations of U.S. citizens abroad.</p><p>The last official to hold both such positions was Henry Kissinger from 1973 to 1975. For Rubio, who was also the former ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and vice-chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to play both roles reflects President Trump’s high confidence in him.</p><p>As such, it is significant that Rubio believes that elements within the US government have recovered technology from a nonhuman intelligence, reverse-engineered it, and let private military contractors take control of it in ways that could be undermining national security and result in a Pearl Harbor-like event. </p><p>“The real risk in transferring technology that is not useful to us today to a corporate entity over decades,” says Rubio, “is that the corporate entity comes to basically possess and control access to it for their own purposes, not for the purposes of national security.”</p><p>Nick Pope, who investigated Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) for the UK Ministry of Defence, said, “It’s hard to overstate the significance of [Rubio’s] statement. Rubio’s remarks are so forthright that one could speculate they’re officially-authorized prelude to Disclosure, to test the waters ahead of an official, Presidential announcement.”</p>
