          <strong>Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions the Cabinet could invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Most readers know this amendment exists but few understand its specific provisions, history of its ratification after JFK&#039;s assassination, and the handful of times it has actually been invoked.</p>

          <strong>Goldwater rule</strong>
          <span class="read-time">10 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article makes claims about Trump&#039;s mental state and potential dementia. The Goldwater rule is the American Psychiatric Association&#039;s ethical guideline prohibiting psychiatrists from diagnosing public figures they haven&#039;t personally examined—directly relevant to the ongoing debate about publicly assessing politicians&#039; cognitive health.</p>

          <strong>Woodrow Wilson</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article raises concerns about presidential incapacity and manipulation by those around the president. Wilson&#039;s 1919 stroke left him severely incapacitated while his wife Edith effectively ran the executive branch in secret—a historical precedent directly parallel to the article&#039;s concerns about unelected figures wielding power through an impaired president.</p>
