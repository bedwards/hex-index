          <strong>Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions the Cabinet could invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Most readers know this amendment exists but few understand its specific provisions, history of its ratification after JFK&#039;s assassination, and the handful of times it has actually been invoked.</p>

          <span class="read-time">10 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article makes claims about Trump&#039;s mental state and potential dementia. The Goldwater rule is the American Psychiatric Association&#039;s ethical guideline prohibiting psychiatrists from diagnosing public figures they haven&#039;t personally examined—directly relevant to the ongoing debate about publicly assessing politicians&#039; cognitive health.</p>

          <strong>Woodrow Wilson</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article raises concerns about presidential incapacity and manipulation by those around the president. Wilson&#039;s 1919 stroke left him severely incapacitated while his wife Edith effectively ran the executive branch in secret—a historical precedent directly parallel to the article&#039;s concerns about unelected figures wielding power through an impaired president.</p>

        <p>Friends,</p><p>His fantastical claims have become more unhinged. This is especially troubling given that he is the oldest president ever to be sworn in and has a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/185016/trump-nephew-family-dementia-history-warning-signs?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">family history of Alzheimer’s</a>.</p><p>Trump even seems to be confused about when he was president. And he keeps claiming that the Epstein files were a hoax created by his predecessors, even though the arrest and demise of Trump’s close friend Jeffrey Epstein <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/jeffrey-epstein-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-minors">happened during Trump’s own first term</a>.</p><p>Paranoia and anger are common symptoms of dementia; so is a loss of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/managing-your-memory/201802/why-self-control-fails-in-dementia#:~:text=Sometimes%2C%20despite%20our%20best%20efforts,reconsider%2C%20redirect%2C%20and%20relax.&amp;text=Andrew%20Budson%2C%20M.D.%2C%20is%20a,neurology%20at%20Harvard%20Medical%20School.">impulse control</a>. All have become cornerstones of Trump’s second term.</p><p>Trump’s Cabinet could invoke the <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/25th-amendment-frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=If%20two%2Dthirds%20of%20both,he%20underwent%20routine%20medical%20procedures.">25th Amendment</a> to remove him from office. Instead, Stephen Miller, Russell Vought, JD Vance, and RFK Jr. seem to be feeding into Trump’s paranoid delusions to increase their own power and advance their own fanatical agendas.</p><p>A person suffering dementia can be a danger to themselves and others. In the most tragic cases, they can be manipulated and taken advantage of by unscrupulous relatives or caretakers. Is <em>this</em> what’s happening in the White House?</p><p><strong>It’s one thing to read about Trump’s mental decline — quite another to see it, which is why this week’s video is particularly important.
