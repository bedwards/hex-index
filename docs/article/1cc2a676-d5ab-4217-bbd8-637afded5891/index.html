        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on Trnka&#039;s pioneering work in puppet animation, but readers may not know the full scope of his career - his influence on global animation, his later masterworks like The Hand, and his resistance to communist propaganda through art</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">While the article describes Trnka discovering &#039;a different kind of stop motion,&#039; readers would benefit from understanding the broader technical and artistic evolution of the medium - from Méliès through Willis O&#039;Brien to understand what made Trnka&#039;s approach revolutionary</p>
