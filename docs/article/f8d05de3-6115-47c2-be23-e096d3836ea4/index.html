It revealed that the number of UCSD students who lack basic reading and math skills has absolutely exploded since 2020. The percentage of students needing a remedial class on basic junior-high-school level math jumped from 0.5% to over 12%. Some were even unable to do basic <em>elementary</em> school math. More than a fifth of entering students now fail to meet basic writing requirements. </p><p>According to <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/740347/sawg-report-on-admissions-review-docs.pdf">the report</a>, pandemic learning loss is one reason there are so many incapable students showing up at UCSD, but most of the problem is due to falling admissions standards. The UC system <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-board-regents-unanimously-approved-changes-standardized-testing">eliminated standardized test requirements</a> in 2020, and since then it has been admitting rising numbers of kids from <a href="https://x.com/sfmcguire79/status/1988246786046112042">bad schools that inflate grades</a> by ridiculous amounts. </p><p>Lots of people have written very good articles about this report since then, so I’ll quote from a few of them. <a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/when-grades-stop-meaning-anything">The Argument’s Kelsey Piper talks about</a> how the problem isn’t that UCSD students haven’t completed the required K-12 math courses — it’s often that they <em>did</em> complete the courses but were given passing grades without actually learning math:</p><blockquote><p>Only 39% of the students in the remedial class knew how to “round the number 374518 to the nearest hundred.”</p><p>Reviewing test results like these, you would expect transcripts full of Cs, Ds, or even failing grades. But alarmingly, these students’ transcripts…said they had taken advanced math courses <em>and performed well.</em></p><p>“Of those who demonstrated math skills not meeting middle school levels,” the report found, 42% reported completing calculus or precalculus…The students were broadly receiving good grades, too: More than a quarter of the students needing remedial math had a 4.0 grade point average <em>in math. </em>The average was 3.7…A number of high schools are awarding A grades to AP Calculus students who do not have any calculus skills and who would get the lowest possible score on the AP Calculus exam if they took it…</p><p>“I have taught AP Calc in circumstances that produced this kind of result,” one public school high school math teacher told me. “No one can do fractions.”…[A]lmost all of them fail the AP Calculus exam at the end of the year.</p></blockquote><p>And <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/math-decline-ucsd/684973/">The Atlantic’s Rose Horowitch finds</a> that while the problem is especially severe at </p>...</source>
