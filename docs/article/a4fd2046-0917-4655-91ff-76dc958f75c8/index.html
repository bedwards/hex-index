          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central metaphor of attention as a &#039;melting iceberg owned by the fairground&#039; directly engages with how human attention has become a scarce commodity exploited by technology platforms. This concept provides the theoretical framework for understanding the article&#039;s critique of smartphone-mediated existence.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with imagery from this Norwegian archipelago where the polar bear photograph was taken. Svalbard is a fascinating location with unique geopolitical status, extreme environment, and serves as a bellwether for climate change—deepening the melting iceberg metaphor.</p>

          <span class="read-time">18 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The opening image of a polar bear sleeping on a melting iceberg serves as the article&#039;s foundational metaphor. Understanding polar bear biology, their dependence on sea ice, and their status as climate change indicators adds scientific depth to the poetic imagery.</p>
