          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with a reference to Escher&#039;s &#039;Spherical Self Portrait&#039; woodcut from 1950, using it as a metaphor for self-reflection. Readers would benefit from understanding Escher&#039;s unique artistic techniques, his fascination with impossible geometries and self-referential imagery, and why his work resonates with themes of perspective and hidden structures.</p>

          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically references &#039;Parisians in the streets for their thirteenth consecutive day of protests against Macron&#039;s pension reforms&#039; as a marker of when Geopolitical Dispatch launched. This was one of the largest protest movements in recent French history, and understanding its scale, causes, and outcomes illustrates the kind of geopolitical events the publication covers.</p>
