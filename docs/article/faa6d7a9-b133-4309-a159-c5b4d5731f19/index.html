        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Badian as a key scholar who shifted Alexander historiography toward viewing him through the lens of his victims. Understanding Badian&#039;s influential revisionist approach to ancient history would give readers essential context for the scholarly debate Devereaux describes.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Arrian is central to this article&#039;s argument about how ancient sources on Alexander were shaped by their political contexts. The article discusses how Arrian wrote during Hadrian&#039;s reign and how this influenced his portrayal, making his biography and historiographical approach directly relevant.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Devereaux&#039;s core argument is that Alexander launched &#039;unprovoked wars&#039; and should be judged by his victims. Understanding the specific military campaigns, their scale of destruction, and the populations affected would provide concrete context for this moral critique.</p>

        <h6>Bret Devereaux vs. the Hax of Sol III—in this case, James Hankins &amp; Adrian Vermeulle: a pushback from two-and-a-half years ago about one of the weirdest emanations of neofascism I have seen in this past truly weird decade…</h6><h4>Introduction</h4><p>I do confess that I was shocked when I got to the end of James Hankins’s &lt;<a href="https://firstthings.com/the-greatness-of-alexander/">https://firstthings.com/the-greatness-of-alexander/</a>&gt; biographical sketch of Aleksander III Argeados of Makedon. Why? Because I learned that Hankins believes that Aleksander was indeed great in a largely positive and admirable sense. Moreover, Hawkins believes that his greatness was the result of something the ancients recognized but that we cannot.</p><p>So what is that something? </p><p>And what was the cause of his greatness (and utter barbarity) at the very disturbing human social practice of war? </p><p>That something and that cause is the exceptional fact that <em>divine favor</em> rested upon Alexander. </p><p>Yes, the favor of God Almighty, the Α &amp; Ω, The One Who Is, rested upon him. For, to quote Hawkins, “[when] human beings… exceptionally, achieve greatness… this can only come through divine help”, as Hawkins says “the ancients saw [but]… we fail to see, or… prefer not to see”.</p><p>At this point my reaction was that somebody should tell Hawkins to put down the keyboard, back up away from the internet, and not return.</p><p>So why is this on my screen? Because I was whipsawed by first seeing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: &lt;<a href="https://x.com/g_shullenberger/status/2005644591060656193">https://x.com/g_shullenberger/status/2005644591060656193</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/why-im-leaving-harvard/">https://www.compactmag.com/article/why-im-leaving-harvard/</a>&gt;: ‘Whether through hostility or neglect, Western history is being phased out or allowed to die on the vine at Harvard...</p></blockquote><p>Followed by a, “no, my colleagues are just teaching it differently” backpedal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: ‘People teaching in Western fields… almost all of these people regard the language of “western civilization” as minimally outmoded and maximally “white supremacist”. I am an outlier because I think that the civilizations of the West should be taught as a tradition, and preferentially at the undergrad level. Most of my colleagues disagree and make some sort of obeisance to global history and assume the equality of all “cultures”…</p></blockquote><p>And then by what I can only read as a frantic attempt at full clawback, as his colleagues are all of a sudden not deluded fools making “obeisance to global history and… the equality of all ‘cultures’”, but are rather truly outstanding learned scholars:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: ‘I keep reading people who </p>...</blockquote>
