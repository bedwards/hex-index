          <strong>Ernst Badian</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Badian as a key scholar who shifted Alexander historiography toward viewing him through the lens of his victims. Understanding Badian&#039;s influential revisionist approach to ancient history would give readers essential context for the scholarly debate Devereaux describes.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Arrian is central to this article&#039;s argument about how ancient sources on Alexander were shaped by their political contexts. The article discusses how Arrian wrote during Hadrian&#039;s reign and how this influenced his portrayal, making his biography and historiographical approach directly relevant.</p>

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Devereaux&#039;s core argument is that Alexander launched &#039;unprovoked wars&#039; and should be judged by his victims. Understanding the specific military campaigns, their scale of destruction, and the populations affected would provide concrete context for this moral critique.</p>
