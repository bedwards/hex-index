        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on Nael Barghouti&#039;s 45-year imprisonment and the broader context of approximately 9,300 Palestinians currently held in Israeli captivity. This Wikipedia article provides essential historical and legal context about administrative detention, prisoner exchanges, and the political significance of prisoners in Palestinian society.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Barghouti explicitly references 1948 refugees his village hosted and how &#039;overnight they became poor people.&#039; The Nakba is foundational to understanding Palestinian identity and resistance, and while often mentioned, its specific historical details—the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians—are often not deeply known.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Barghouti was freed through a &#039;prisoner exchange deal&#039; in January 2025. The 2011 Shalit exchange, which released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners including many senior figures, established the precedent for such deals and is directly relevant to understanding how Barghouti gained his freedom.</p>

(Photo: Jeremy Scahill)</figcaption></figure></div><p>“I never lost hope, and I never will,” said Nael Barghouti, a 68-year-old Palestinian from the occupied West Bank who spent more than four decades in Israeli captivity. It has been a year since Barghouti won his freedom through a prisoner exchange deal signed between Hamas and Israel in January 2025. As a condition of his release, Barghouti had to agree to go into exile and was deported to Egypt a month later. “I have been optimistic from the very first day I began my struggle,” he said. “In prison, I was optimistic that I would be free one day. And, even if I were to die in prison, I would remain content, because those who come after me will continue the path, because they are convinced that we are in the right.”</p><p>According to the most recent and reliable statistics, there are approximately 9,300 Palestinians currently held in Israeli captivity. Nearly half of these have not been charged or brought to trial. Additionally, there are an unknown number of Palestinians held in military camps run by the Israeli army. At least 87 Palestinians have been killed inside Israeli prisons since October 7, 2023, including several documented cases of death by torture, abuse, or intentional neglect. “Without any prior warning, a prisoner is detained with no charge—a 15 year old [boy], or a woman. Malicious arrest—arrest simply to send a lesson to entire generations. They are received with beatings, bone‑breaking, and the spread of infectious diseases,” Barghouti told Drop Site.</p><p>In a wide-ranging, in-person interview in Istanbul, Barghouti reflected on his time in Israeli captivity, the torture he endured alongside other Palestinian prisoners, and why he believes the Palestinian cause will ultimately triumph. “We are not seekers of blood or wars, but we will accept nothing other than defending ourselves and our rights,” Barghouti said. “Why is it forbidden for Palestinians to live like any other people—to leave when they wish, return when they wish, go to the sea when they wish? Personally, I have seen the sea only once, in a prison transport vehicle, and when I was released. The sea is thirty kilometers (18 miles) from my village—why? Why </p>...</source>
