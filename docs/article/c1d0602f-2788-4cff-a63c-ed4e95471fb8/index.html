Here’s a breakdown of the post series:</p><p><strong><a href="https://thepalindrome.org/p/the-anatomy-of-the-least-squares">Part 1: Theory and math</a></strong><a href="https://thepalindrome.org/p/the-anatomy-of-the-least-squares">.</a> If you haven’t read this post yet, please do so!</p><p><strong><a href="https://thepalindrome.org/p/the-anatomy-of-the-least-squares-ab5">Part 2: Explorations in simulations.</a></strong> You learned how to simulate and visualize data and regression results.</p><p><strong><a href="https://thepalindrome.org/p/the-anatomy-of-the-least-squares-818">Part 3: real-data examples</a></strong><a href="https://thepalindrome.org/p/the-anatomy-of-the-least-squares-818">.</a> Here you learned how to import, inspect, clean, and analyze a real-world dataset using the statsmodels, pandas, and seaborn libraries.</p><p><strong>Part 4 (this post): modeling GPT activations.</strong> We’ll dissect OpenAI’s LLM GPT2, the precursor to its state-of-the-art ChatGPT. You’ll learn more about least-squares and also about LLM mechanisms.</p><h3><strong>Following along with code</strong></h3><p>Seeing math come alive in code gives you a deeper understanding and intuition — and that warm fuzzy feeling of confidence in your newly harnessed coding and machine-learning skills. <em>You can learn a lot of math with a bit of code</em><strong>.</strong></p><p>Here is the link to the <a href="https://github.com/mikexcohen/Substack/blob/main/DSUnpacked/leastSquares_4.ipynb">online code on my GitHub</a> for this post.

LLMs are not so complicated, and you can learn all about them with just a high-school-level math background.
