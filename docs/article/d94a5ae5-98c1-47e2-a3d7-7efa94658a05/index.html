I don't know—but I do know that being forced to think through a possible future left me better prepared for the actual one we faced.</p><p>That's why when Andre came up with the idea of The Prediction Game I was extremely excited. Everyone prognosticates. But The Prediction Game is a chance to put those prognostications on paper, and see how they look at the end of the year.
