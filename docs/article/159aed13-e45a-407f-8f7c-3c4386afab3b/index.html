        <p><em>Welcome back to Techno Sapiens! I’m Jacqueline Nesi, a psychology professor and mom of two young boys who have started pointing to my belly and asking,“Why is it so big?”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>  </em></p><p><em>If you like Techno Sapiens, please consider sharing it with a friend today!</em></p><div><hr></div><h6><em><strong>5 min read</strong></em></h6><p>I’m sitting in a tiny, beige room at the doctor’s office, my elbow sticking slightly to the padded arm of the blood-draw chair. Next to me, the phlebotomist is clacking away at a keyboard.</p><p>She glances over at me. <em>Ready for another one?</em></p><p>We’re onto the third of four blood draws this morning. It’s a three-hour glucose test, which means the only thing I’ve ingested in the past 14 hours is a warm, lime-flavored drink with 100 grams of sugar.</p><p>There are thoughts swirling around my brain, but I’m having trouble coalescing them into anything coherent.

No fanfare, no balloons, no cake with blue frosting—just an eagerly-awaited, 12-week phone call and a <em>yes, we want to know right now.</em></p><p>We now have two boys who are, objectively, the most perfect, loving, curious, smart, adorable children in the history of all children.</p><p>For our third child, we’re opting to wait until the birth to find out. And no matter how many times I try decoding that phlebotomist’s question—did she ruin the surprise after looking at my medical chart? Or was she simply asking?—the suspense is only building.</p><p>So, when the ...</p>
