I had joined a citizen’s exchange group in 1969 that participated in dialogues with Russian citizens in different cities. One of those cities, Kharkiv, now in Ukraine, was of special interest because my grandmother Sarah’s relatives lived there after migrating from Lithuania in 1905. </p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>I was close to Sarah as a child in the Bronx. I remember sitting next to her by the radio in her small, cramped apartment, listening to<strong> </strong>some kind of foreign station reporting the names of Jewish people murdered village by village in Lithuania and Ukraine.
