One Chinese app had taken over an entire region. And not quietly.</p><p>That map stayed in my head. It said something bigger than “people like cheap stuff”. I wanted to understand what was happening behind the scenes, so I brought back someone who had lived inside that story for ten years.</p><p><strong>John Pabon</strong> spent a decade in China. He worked inside factories, with big international brands, with local governments and with executives who were trying to understand sustainability long before it became a global talking point.</p><p>He saw a version of China that tourists never see.</p><p><strong>Our conversation changed the way I see Temu, China and the whole sustainability debate.</strong></p><h2>What John told me</h2><p>When John moved to Shanghai in 2009, the country was still carrying the reputation of the old factory era.

Companies test ideas in real time. The market itself becomes the research.</p><p>Add a strong influencer culture and you get the perfect user funnel.<br>Add a global cost of living crisis and you get scale.</p><p>This is why Temu sits at the top of almost every European app chart.</p><h2>What surprised me most</h2><p>John told me something I did not expect.</p><p>He said that Western companies with </p>...</source>
