      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>This week I asked some friends of the substack to write a little note on the books they loved this year, and on any which disappointed them. Everyone interpreted my prompt slightly differently because it was badly written. I just used the words “things you liked” and so, one person didn’t realise I meant books. We fixed that. My criteria for who I asked was people who, if they said to me “oh this book is actually good” I would assume this to be accurate. Here are their responses. They’re lovely to read.</p><p><strong>Rachel Connolly (me)</strong></p><p>This is not an exotic suggestion but I had a truly beautiful time reading Septology by Jon Fosse last January.

I read Happiness as Such by Natalia Ginsburg and loved it. I’m slowly working through all of her translated books. This one had one of the funniest chapter openings I have encountered: “I reached Leeds yesterday morning. I stayed in a boarding house called the Hong-Kong.
