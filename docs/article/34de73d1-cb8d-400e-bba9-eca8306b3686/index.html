        <p>Welcome back to “One First,” a weekly newsletter that aims to make the U.S. Supreme Court more accessible to lawyers and non-lawyers alike. I’m grateful to all of you for your continued support, and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks.</p><p>Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“<strong>On the Docket</strong>”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“<strong>The </strong><em><strong>One First </strong></em><strong>‘Long Read’”</strong>); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:</p><p>As ever, there is … a lot going on. But I was particularly struck by comments that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made on Fox News on Friday. In response to concerns about whether ICE agents could be prosecuted by local or state authorities for their increasingly controversial conduct in and around Chicago, Miller first accused Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker of “seditious conspiracy,” and then, in a message certainly intended to be heard far and wide, said: “to all ICE officers: you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties. And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop or obstruct you is committing a felony.”</p><div class="bluesky-wrap outer" style="height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;" data-attrs="{&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;3m3xovkv7a42q&quot;,&quot;authorDid&quot;:&quot;did:plc:4llrhdclvdlmmynkwsmg5tdc&quot;,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;Aaron Rupar&quot;,&quot;authorHandle&quot;:&quot;atrupar.com&quot;,&quot;authorAvatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.bsky.app/img/avatar/plain/did:plc:4llrhdclvdlmmynkwsmg5tdc/bafkreibmhm3h6ar52pogvolisrzjdhwa2myras5vkxzj67twxn2l6pogwu@jpeg&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Stephen Miller on Fox threatens to arrest JB Pritzker for \&quot;seditious conspiracy\&quot; and says, \&quot;to all ICE officers: you have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.

Their accusations are so often confessions.</p><p>But I wanted to devote a bit of time to the second part of Miller’s message—his claim that ICE officers have “federal immunity in the conduct of [their] duties,” and that anyone who seeks to prosecute them is committing a felony. It is, to be clear, wrong on its face. The federal government <em>absolutely</em> retains the ability to prosecute federal law enforcement officers who break the law, even in the course of carrying out their duties. Indeed, the specter of criminal prosecution has long been the federal government’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1678/117525/20190930171236675_17-1678bsacUnitedStates.pdf#page=39">principal argument</a> for why we <em>don’t</em> need damages remedies to ensure that immigration officers follow the law.
