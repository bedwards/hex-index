        <p><strong>From an interpersonal perspective</strong>, of course, the pain already reaches human limits: the “doged” by Musk $4 billion per year on programs to combat malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, hunger, illiteracy, etc. in the poorest countries of the world that were counted on by millions of children, without which <a href="https://firstfocus.org/resource/fact-sheet-usaid-cuts-total-4-billion-for-children-tens-of-thousands-of-lives/">tens of thousands will die</a>, alone is enough—and it'll get worse.</p><p>But <strong>from a historical perspective</strong>, the outlook of "seems like we dodged it" is becoming clearer.</p><p>Since 2019, I've been writing that the wheels of history are turning toward repeating the collapse of capitalism into fascism of the 1920s—only this time, 1) neoliberal America plays the role of Weimar Germany, and 2) there’s no USSR.</p><p>The possibility of history on such a path became a fact when Biden-Harris skillfully handed over to Trump the turn to have his own way with the hollowed out by neoliberalism United States corpse — and to watch the rise of fascist power in the United States as in the 1930s, but without seeing an opposing leftist force to fight back, was a terrifying prospect.</p><p>But from day one of Trump's return, the process of turning Trump's power into a Trump regime caused mixed feelings: on one hand, all elements of classical fascism are in place—first and foremost, the program of racially-driven mass deportations. On the other, even its execution feels like some kind of clown show. This duality is perfectly embodied in its media face, Trump’s border czar Tom Homan, who voices Himmler-like soul-chilling rhetoric on American TV being barely able to move his tongue drunk, and getting drunker with each appearance.</p><p>And finally, with Trump's declaration of a trade war on the whole world, the picture clicked for me: we (all of humanity) got lucky—the 1930s are indeed repeating, but this time—as a farce.</p><p>Paraphrasing a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch01.htm">certain German writer</a>, <em>in history, all great events and personalities appear twice: first as tragedy, second as farce—Caussidière instead of Danton, Louis Blanc instead of Robespierre, Donald Trump instead of Adolf Hitler, Elon Musk instead of Henry Ford, and Stephen Miller instead of Adolf Eichmann.</em></p><p>In a waltz-like tempo, Trump shows how attempts to pin down the failures of capitalism on an arbitrary group of people (and not even capitalists) and to offset the pain they cause by inflicting more pain on them inevitably results in pain for everyone.</p><p>This doesn't mean that we got ...</p>
