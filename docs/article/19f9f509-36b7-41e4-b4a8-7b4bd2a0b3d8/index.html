In 2003, a Swedish animator created a 3D frog character to accompany "The Annoying Thing," which caught the attention of ringtone maker Jamba!, who eventually combined "The Annoying Thing," the 3D frog character, and the theme music from <em>Beverly Hills Cop</em>, rebranding this conceptual Frankenstein as "Axel F."</p><p>At its peak, Crazy Frog captured 31% of the UK ringtone market, generating over £40 million in sales in 2005, driven by an extensive advertising blitz where the song was featured up to 26 times a day on British television (per channel), reaching an estimated 87% of the population. The ringtone was so ubiquitous that it later spawned a full-length single, which climbed to #50 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>Crazy Frog's meteoric rise is a perfect encapsulation of the 2000s ringtone craze: a grating 30-second meme that started as a phone alert, morphed into a charting single, and is now a forgotten relic—practically unknown to Gen Z.</p><p>For five years, record labels raked in billions of dollars selling polyphonic ringtones, mostly to fans who already owned these songs on a combination of vinyl, CD, and iTunes. However, this gold rush was fleeting, gone months after its peak.</p><p>So today, we'll trace the rise and fall of music ringtones, examine what led to their rapid decline, and spotlight a corner of the world where this anachronistic phenomenon still thrives.</p><h1>The Rise and Fall of Music Ringtones</h1><p>In the early 2000s, polyphonic ringtones solved a major problem for the music industry and a trivial pain point for consumers. For everyday people, customizable ringtones became an answer to a question no one had </p>...</source>
