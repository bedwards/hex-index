        <p>It’s that time of year again when promising students are asking for letters of recommendation, and prepping their grad school applications, so I thought I would take a moment to shine a light on the <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/graduate/index.html">University of Rochester’s MA in Literary Translation Studies (MALTS)</a> program and Open Letter’s role in it. </p><p>And not to bury the lead, the first application deadline is <strong>December 15, 2025. </strong>Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, but students applying this December will get the first crack at joining the 2026-27 class. With a limited number of slots available, I strongly encourage anyone who is interested in MALTS to apply sooner rather than later.</p><p>Started back in 2009, <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/index.html">MALTS</a> was designed to give passionate emerging translators a place to hone their craft through both academic study and working closely with the press in hopes of launching a successful career as a literary translator. A significant number of MALTS students have gone on to translate both for <a href="https://www.openletterbooks.org/">Open Letter</a> and elsewhere (with Will Vanderhyden probably having the most overall translations published), or have gone on to work in publishing or the literary field in one way or another.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>The program is designed to be a year of course work and then a summer/semester of thesis research (aka, time to just translate), and to combine a few key elements: study of translation theory and international literature, work with <a href="https://www.openletterbooks.org/">Open Letter Books</a>, workshop your translations with high-profile authors, and produce a book-length, publishable translation.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/graduate/index.html" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg" width="330" height="427" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:330,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:69442,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/graduate/index.html&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://threepercentproblem.substack.com/i/177370894?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q9jT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F836aa80a-f9dc-4ee8-95a9-d74f3e01e504_330x427.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I’ll leave aside the academic stuff for today—although stay tuned, since I love to write <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/College/translation/threepercent/tag/world-literature-and-translation/">a goofy “listicle”</a> about the books I select for my “World Literature &amp; Translation” class, in which we read contemporary translations and talk to translators, authors, and editors—and just talk a bit more about the Open Letter element of this. </p><p>We’ve always been closely tied to the <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/graduate/index.html">MALTS program</a> (and the <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/lts/clts/index.html">CLTS</a> one for undergrads), but going forward, I think this connection will be both richer and more explicit. Some of the changes to the MALTS program are internal and too in the weeds to discuss, but from a bird’s-eye view, the goal is to assist students in finding a thesis project as early in their studies as possible—preferably one that Open Letter would be interested in publishing. (Although I obviously can’t guarantee that, it is going to be a goal going forward.) This coincides with working </p>...</source>
