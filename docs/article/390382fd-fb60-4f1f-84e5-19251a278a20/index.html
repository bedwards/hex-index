          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with discussion of the film Blue Moon about Rodgers and Hart&#039;s breakup, praising Hart as a &#039;lyrical genius&#039; alongside Porter, Gershwin, and Berlin. Readers would benefit from learning about Hart&#039;s troubled life, his partnership with Richard Rodgers, and his remarkable body of work that produced so many American standards.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references White as &#039;the White of Strunk &amp; White, beloved by a certain sort of American writer as the supposed last word on the rules of writing.&#039; Understanding the history and influence of this iconic writing manual—and the debates surrounding its prescriptions—adds essential context to the author&#039;s critique of White&#039;s prose style.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author contrasts White unfavorably with Joseph Mitchell, David Halberstam, and Gay Talese—key figures in the New Journalism movement. Understanding this literary movement helps readers grasp the stylistic tension the essay explores between White&#039;s genteel personal essay tradition and the more immersive, experimental approach these other writers pioneered.</p>
