        <p>We have been regular customers of <a href="https://fishtalesonline.com/">Fish Tales</a> in Cobble Hill since we first moved to the neighborhood in 2023. We are so grateful it exists because it makes it possible to get fresh, high quality fish year round, which is the only reason we can stick to the heart healthy Mediterranean diet we aim for most days (I have really high genetically determined cholesterol). Their wild king salmon is our favorite but we’ve never gotten anything bad from there. As an owner-operator myself I am fascinated by the tiny decisions that make a business run well and Fish Tales’ recent relocation is a shining example of present and thoughtful business ownership.</p><p>Earlier this year Fish Tales relocated to a bigger spot just a few storefronts away from the original location. What I saw was a small business owner taking over the reins from his father and modernizing the business as they expand and optimize. I am writing from my own perspective as a fellow business owner with a shop a few blocks down and also as a long time customer. I did not interview John or Chris for this piece, I’m just so happy to see a family business evolve like this. In my last post I wrote about how important it is to be present in your restaurant so you know what the challenges and bottlenecks are in order to improve them. This relocation and expansion makes it clear to me that both Chris and John are like-minded business owners in the sense that they are actually at the store working the same job as their staff. I know for a fact that Chris is often in the shop because I buy fish from him several times a week.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg" width="1456" height="1941" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2279501,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lularphelps.substack.com/i/179270237?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!y5r6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb6a25406-0fe8-48af-8c19-6dd4bd58504a_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Shrimp cocktail from a New Year’s Eve Party</figcaption></figure></div><h3>The Old Fish Tales</h3><p>It was a small shop and sometimes it would get very crowded and there could be some confusion about the line. For example, someone could be waiting to have their fresh shrimp cleaned and peeled and the person behind them might not know it’s their turn to order. Bottleneck. This is a small thing but over time it becomes an annoyance for the staff, having to manage bodies in a space. Especially around the holidays it would get very crowded. In the new store there is more space and there are stanchions that clearly communicate where you </p>...</source>
