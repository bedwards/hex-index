        <p>Hi Everyone, </p><p>This week I attended the <a href="https://securityforum.md">Moldova Security Forum</a>, which meant coffee and networking with lots of out of town visitors. Multiple people I spoke with mentioned how unfortunate it was that there isn’t any easy guide for foreigners to connect with upcoming events in Chisinau - specifically musical and cultural events. </p><p>I’ve thought for a while that this would be a nice addition to Moldova Matters but I’ve never had much time to explore it. Today, I’ve decided to ask your opinion so you can let me know if it’s something worth digging into more. </p><p>Now, I realize that many readers are not physically present in Moldova - so here’s my idea of how this could be interesting for people regardless of location. I’m envisioning a monthly article with the following information: </p><ol><li><p>A short (300-500 words) guest essay on a relevant topic. It could be about local art or music, or a reflection on an event from the last month. </p></li><li><p>A curated list of upcoming events in the next month (in Chisinau and the near surrounds).  </p></li></ol><p>If you have 2 minutes, please fill out this survey to let me know if you find this interesting and what types of events you would want to be alerted about. </p><h3>Wanna Contribute?</h3><p>If enough readers are interested in the product I described above, then my next step is going to be trying to figure out how to make it happen. Personally, I’m not the most plugged into the culture and events scene myself. So if this is really your space, and you’d like to contribute reply to this email and let me know! Maybe it would be a guest essay from time to time, or just sharing your favorite place to see upcoming events -feel free to reach out!</p>
