Jane is an <strong><a href="https://www.asc.ox.ac.uk/person/jane-cooper">Examination Fellow at All Souls College</a></strong>, Oxford, where she is writing a PhD thesis, working on the pre-Burkean sublime with an interest in the poetry of Abraham Cowley. <strong><a href="https://x.com/yeppjane?lang=en">Here she is on Twitter</a></strong>. I can also tell you that Jane is a splendid conversationalist about all matters literary.</em></p><p><em>There have previously been guest posts from the academics <strong><a href="https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/andrew-lang-and-the-catawampus-of?utm_source=publication-search">Anna McCullough</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/critical-essays-on-those-boys-are?utm_source=publication-search">Brad Skow</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/jane-austens-rake-problem?utm_source=publication-search">Edward McLaren</a></strong>.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>Alexander Pope’s best-known poem is <em>An Essay on Man</em> (1733), a four-part epistle to the great Tory philosopher Bolingbroke, written in unremitting heroic couplets. Though many will admire his magisterial mock-heroics <em>The Rape of the Lock </em>(1714) and <em>The Dunciad</em> (1727), the latter, as John Mullan said, might be the greatest unread poem in the language. <em>An Essay on Man</em> is still (unconsciously) quoted in a way the others are not.</p><p><em>An Essay on Man </em>is a defence of the thesis that the known world is the best possible of all worlds, a theodicy expounded by Gottfried Leibniz in his 1710 <em>Essais de Théodicée</em>. Pope sought to “vindicate the ways of God to man”, alluding to Milton’s famous claim to “justify the ways of God to man” in <em>Paradise Lost</em>. Pope’s composition is stunning. But in spite of its metrical integrity and aphoristic self-assurance, <em>An Essay on Man</em> buckles under its own philosophical ambition. In the words of Dr Johnson: “Never were penury of knowledge and vulgarity of sentiment so happily disguised”. Voltaire’s dismissal of the poem was equally scathing: ‘““All is well” — absurd thesis that Pope and Leibniz maintain”.</p><p>How can we read the following, taken from the poem’s first epistle, without sympathising with this criticism?</p><blockquote><p>Cease, then, nor order imperfection name:<br>Our proper bliss depends on what we blame.<br>Know thy own point: this kind, this due degree<br>Of blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee.<br>Submit. In this, or any other sphere,<br>Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear:<br>Safe in the hand of one disposing Power,<br>Or in the natal, or the mortal hour.<br>All nature is but art, unknown to thee;<br>All chance, direction, which thou canst not see;<br>All discord, harmony not understood;<br>All partial evil, universal good:<br>And, spite of pride in erring reason’s spite,<br>One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.</p></blockquote><p>Maynard Mack ...</p>
