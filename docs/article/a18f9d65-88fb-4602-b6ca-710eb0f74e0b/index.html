        <p class="topic-summary">The article uses Black Friday as the promotional hook for the subscription discount. Understanding the history and psychology of Black Friday shopping—from its origins in Philadelphia traffic jams to becoming a global retail phenomenon—provides context for why this timing matters for subscription businesses.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Kent Beck explicitly states his mission is helping &#039;geeks feel safe in the world.&#039; Psychological safety is a well-researched concept in organizational behavior, pioneered by Amy Edmondson, that explains why feeling safe enables learning, creativity, and admitting mistakes—exactly what Beck describes in his Chat community.</p>

          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Beck describes &#039;working through questions in public&#039; with messy, unpolished thinking. Open notebook science represents this same philosophy in research—sharing work before it&#039;s finished. This concept illuminates why creators increasingly share rough drafts and thinking processes rather than polished outputs.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t going to do this.</p><p>Then I realized: if you’ve been reading along &amp; thinking “yeah, maybe I should pay for this,” Black Friday is probably when you’re thinking about it. So.</p><p><strong>$180/year annual plan through December 1st.</strong></p><p>Normally $250. </p><h4><strong>What am I doing here</strong></h4><p>My mission is to help geeks feel safe in the world. Right now that means figuring out what safety looks like when the machines can code.</p><p>I don’t have answers yet. I have a lot of questions &amp; I’m working through them in public. Paid subscribers get to watch that happen &amp; shape it:</p><p><strong>Chat</strong> is where the real work happens. You bring a problem. I try to help. Sometimes I can. Sometimes I learn something I wouldn’t have noticed on my own. </p><p><strong>Essays</strong> go out early to paid folks. Messy thinking about responsibility, coherence, what changes when speed increases by 10x. These pieces aren’t polished. That’s the point.</p><p><strong>Weekly Thinkies.</strong> Habits of creative thought. I used to think I was just “creative.” Turns out most of my ideas come from identifiable thinking patterns. I’m teaching those.</p><p>People who show up in Chat ask real questions &amp; admit when they’re stuck. That’s where the good conversations happen.</p><h4><strong>If you’re thinking about it…</strong></h4><p>This is the lowest I’ll go on annual pricing. If something here has helped you think differently about your work, come join us.</p>
