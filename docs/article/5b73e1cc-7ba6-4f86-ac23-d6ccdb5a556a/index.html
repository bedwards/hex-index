Much as he has recently enlisted the Justice Department to persecute his political enemies.</p><p>“Last month, I signed an executive order to provide training for a quick reaction force, that can help quell civil disturbances,” Trump <a href="https://www.sofx.com/president-trump-address-to-pentagon-leaders-at-marine-corps-base-quantico-full-transcript/">told</a> several hundred U.S. generals flown in from around the world for the unprecedented meeting, held at the US Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.</p><p>“This is going to be important for the people in this room, because it’s the enemy from within, and we have to handle it before it gets out of control,” he said. “It won’t get out of control once you get involved.”</p><p><em><strong>Trump says U.S. cities should be military “training ground”</strong></em></p><p>Trump said he told Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth they should use American cities as a “training ground” for the U.S. military, particularly in cities and states with elected Democratic leaders that Trump does not like, or who dare criticize Trump.</p><p>“And I told Pete we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military — National Guard, but military — because we’re going into Chicago very soon,” Trump said. “That’s a big city with an incompetent governor.

We don’t need the military,’” Trump told the gathering at Quantico. “No, they need the military desperately. How about Portland? Portland, Oregon, where it looks like a war zone.”</p><p>“We have many cities in great shape, too, by the way,” Trump said. “But it seems that the ones that are run by the radical-left Democrats — what they’ve done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles — they’re very unsafe places, and we’re going to straighten them out one by one.”</p><p>“And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room,” Trump said. “That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.”</p><p><em><strong>‘We don’t want you fighting wars’ abroad</strong></em></p><p>Trump told the generals that he did not plan to use the U.S. military to fight wars in the Middle East or abroad.</p><p>“We want to save you for other things, or save you for </p>...</source>
