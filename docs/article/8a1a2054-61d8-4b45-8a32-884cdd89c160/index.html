        <p><em>Boozhoo, indinawemaaganidog! Aaniin! That is to say hello, all of my relatives! Welcome to another edition of</em> An Irritable Métis. <em>As niibin begins to wind down, despite the recent arrival of wildfire smoke in the valley from various lightning-caused blazes around Missoula, it feels like everyone is gearing up for the arrival of dagwaagin. I know I am! But … did August even exist?! I was so focused on getting <strong>IndigiPalooza MT</strong> off the ground for most of July that everything since has been a blur. It’s hard to imagine it’s been more than three weeks since I delivered the last carload of magnificent spirits to the airport. What an experience that was.</em></p><h4>Friends, before I continue, I’d be remiss if I don’t mention that the first big announcement post-inaugural IPFEST will go out probably later this week, early next. If you want to get on board with being first to know of such things, visit <strong><a href="https://www.ipfestmt.com/">HERE</a></strong> and scroll to the bottom of the page to sign up for updates!</h4><p><em>Meanwhile, your continued and generous support remains essential, particularly as new challenges present themselves. You have no idea how much the support I get from this newsletter via paid subscriptions means to me and how grateful I am. If you like what you read here, and if you’ve got a spare $50 to throw this way for the next year, or can even scrape off $5/month, it is eminently helpful and appreciated. There is a lot brewing for 2026 and I think things will get interesting in a hurry.</em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontierk8.org/" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg" width="1456" height="728" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:728,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:247618,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.frontierk8.org/&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chrislatray.substack.com/i/171913639?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UYc8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83429c69-f916-4e60-9b81-5b0d931d5d67_2000x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This week – tomorrow, in fact, as I write – I hit the road again in earnest. I will drive north and east with a slight detour to Choteau to visit my friends <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2024/08/21/excerpt-from-becoming-little-shell-by-chris-la-tray/">Al and Elaine Wiseman</a>, then from there on to Glasgow, MT, where I’ll overnight in preparation for a full day on Thursday in Wolf Point on the Fort Peck Reservation. I’ll be there for two reasons. First is my initial school visit of the year<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>; I’ll be at <a href="https://www.frontierk8.org/">Frontier School</a> (Home of the Mustangs!) to visit a group of K-3rd graders, then a group of 6th-8th graders, and finally a group of 4th-5th graders. It seems like just a week ago I was rolling out of a school into a spring day thinking I wouldn’t have to be in one again for ages and suddenly, </p>...</source>
