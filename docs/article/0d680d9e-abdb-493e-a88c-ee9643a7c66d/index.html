          <strong>Induced demand</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses both induced travel (adding road capacity elicits more travel) and traffic evaporation (the opposite effect when capacity is reduced). This economic concept is central to understanding why freeway widening projects fail to reduce congestion and why the Hammersmith Bridge closure didn&#039;t cause predicted traffic chaos.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses the YIMBY vs NIMBY debate in California housing policy, including specific legislation like SB 79 and the tension between pro-housing reformers and progressive groups opposing density. Understanding the YIMBY movement&#039;s origins, philosophy, and political strategies provides essential context.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article uses the 2019 closure of this Victorian suspension bridge as a case study in traffic evaporation and urban resilience. The bridge&#039;s history, engineering challenges with its cast iron structure, and the ongoing debate about its future repair provide rich context for the transportation policy discussion.</p>
