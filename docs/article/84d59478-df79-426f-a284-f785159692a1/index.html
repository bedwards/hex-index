        <p>Friends,</p><p>Trump isn’t just destroying the White House to make room for a vanity ballroom — he’s selling it off to the highest bidders, who conveniently need favors from his regime.</p><p>The giant ballroom is Trump’s monument to corruption. </p><p>Google and Amazon are <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/10/trumps-white-house-ballroom-sparks-questions-about-funding-and-ethics/">both chipping in</a> with massive donations. They both just so happen to have <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/">massive antitrust lawsuits</a> working their way through the courts. Amazon <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/08/25/2025-08-25-federal-appellate-court-finds-nlrb-unconstitutional/">is also suing</a> to get the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional. But I’m sure their ballroom donations have nothing to do with that, right?</p><p>I suppose that Apple’s support for the ballroom isn’t related to its <a href="https://prospect.org/2024/03/27/2024-03-27-bump-in-the-road-apple-doj-lawsuit-auto/">own legal problems</a> — or its desire to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/08/06/apple-exempt-from-100-semiconductor-tariffs-thanks-to-its-100b-us-investment">remain exempt</a> from Trump’s tariffs.</p><p>Oh, and Meta. It’s also involved in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/technology/meta-antitrust-trial-concludes.html">major antitrust lawsuit</a> with the Federal Trade Commission right now. But I’m sure the company is just donating because Mark Zuckerberg is a patriot.</p><p>Surely it’s not because Meta and other Big Tech companies stand to gain handsomely if Trump maintains his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-tech-leaders-unite-american-ai-dominance/">corporate-friendly AI policy</a>.</p><p>Other generous donors to the ballroom project include cryptocurrency players like <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/">Coinbase, Ripple, and even the Winklevoss twins</a>.</p><p>I’m sure the Winklevoss twins would be thrilled if Trump kept up his crypto-friendly policies, which <em>he’s </em>also cashing in on.</p><p>And Coinbase’s donation probably has nothing to do with the company’s being under an active regulatory <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/technology/coinbase-sec-investigation.html">investigation</a>, right?</p><p>Another donor: The railroad giant <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/">Union Pacific</a>, which is eyeing a <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-report">$72 billion megamerger</a> that needs approval from federal regulators.</p><p>Another: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/list-donors-trump-new-white-house-ballroom-east-wing-rcna239481">Comcast</a>, which needs government approval for the <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/acquisitions/acquisitions-by-comcast/__7JxypYsnb1VsWCiQ_lrCGvHzsxtHKJjq_WPi5an152I#list-of-acquisitions">mergers and acquisitions it pursues</a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/#:~:text=Separately%2C%20Blackstone%2C%20the%20private%20equity%20firm%20run%20by%20ballroom%20donor%20Stephen%20Schwarzman%2C%20just%20announced%20an%20%2418.3%20billion%20deal%20alongside%20TPG%20to%20take%20mammogram%20rollup%20Hologic%20private%2C%20which%20presumably%20Schwarzman%20wants%20the%20government%20to%20approve.">does</a> billionaire private equity executive Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone.</p><p>Companies that <a href="https://lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/training/IITSEC-Fact-Sheet-Final.pdf">survive</a> on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-government-contracting-push/">government contacts</a> are also chipping in, including <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/">Palantir</a> and <a href="https://prospect.org/2025/10/28/heres-what-trumps-ballroom-donors-want/">Lockheed Martin</a>. How kind of them.</p><p>The Supreme Court has narrowed the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/supreme-court-weakens-safeguards-against-state-public-corruption">definition</a> of “<a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/07/us-supreme-court-holds-that-federal-bribery-law-does-not-criminalize-gratuities">bribery</a>” to the point where a specific favor has to be demanded in advance of payment. So we can’t say this is bribery … exactly.</p><p>But the writing’s on the wall — perhaps literally. These donors <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-white-house-ballroom-donor-names/#:~:text=Also%20under%20consideration%3A%20listing%20donor%20names%20on%20a%20website%2C%20though%20no%20final%20decision%20has%20been%20made.%C2%A0">are likely to get their names</a> etched into the new White House building itself.</p><p>Could there be a more fitting monument to the Trump presidency?</p><p>That’s because in Trump’s White House, <em>everything</em> is for sale — even the building itself.</p><p>Memo to all of us: One of the first things to be done when sanity and legality ...</p>
