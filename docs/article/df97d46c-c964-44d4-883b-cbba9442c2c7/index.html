We’ll cover everything from the Senate deal to end the shutdown (and where that leaves the Affordable Care Act subsidies) to last week’s announcement that the Trump administration has reached a price-lowering deal with the makers of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro. We’ll also cover some interesting studies that have come across our desks, including one on autism and Covid-19, and a surprising result from a clinical trial of caffeine abstinence and atrial fibrillation (“AFib”). We’ll also take suggestions, so please leave comments and questions below!</p><p><strong>To join us live, <a href="https://open.substack.com/live-stream/76692?utm_source=live-stream-scheduled-upsell">click this link</a></strong> (you can watch on any device, including the <em><a href="https://substack.com/app?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_source=insidemedicine&amp;utm_content=author-post-insert">Substack</a></em><a href="https://substack.com/app?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_source=insidemedicine&amp;utm_content=author-post-insert"> app</a>).
