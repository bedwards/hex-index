        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly references Bashō as a key influence and quotes him on living poetry. Understanding his life as a wandering haiku master and his philosophy of travel provides essential context for the author&#039;s self-comparison as a modern traveling writer.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Saigyō and his newly translated poetry collection, quoting his 800-year-old poem and drawing direct parallels between the medieval wandering monk&#039;s life and the author&#039;s own journeys. This is central to understanding the article&#039;s spiritual framework.</p>

I was in the “B” section of the poetry collection idly looking for something related to Bashō and, failing in that quest, stumbled instead across a copy of David Budbill’s <em><a href="https://www.coppercanyonpress.org/books/moment-to-moment-by-david-budbill/">Moment to Moment: Poems of a Mountain Recluse</a></em>. I was pretty sure I already have it but I didn’t have it <em>with</em> me and I didn’t hesitate to pick it up. Back at my hotel with a little time to linger before the evening event I was able to get a good jump on reading it.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>“I am a very simpleminded person. I write in a very plain way. I want to write poems that can be understood by just about anybody.”</p><p>— David Budbill</p></div><p>I feel a degree of kinship with David Budbill, though I never met him in person. My friend Leath Tonino did, though, and published a wonderful interview with him at <em>Tricycle</em> a few years ago which you may read <strong><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/voice-outside/?utm_campaign=02519201&amp;utm_source=p3s4h3r3s">HERE</a></strong> if you like. I love Budbill’s approach to writing and to living. It was comforting, if that’s even the correct word, to spend some time in his company; with his reflections on his home near Judevine Mountain </p>...</source>
