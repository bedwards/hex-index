        <p><em>Hi everyone,</em></p><p><em>As we start 2024, I find myself reflecting on the importance of health. Wishing good health may seem like a common “new year” greeting, but it's never been more meaningful than in today's context: we've never been sicker, in both body and mind. Consider these sobering facts:</em></p><ul><li><p><em>6/10 Americans live with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/infographic/chronic-diseases.htm">a chronic disease</a>. Global diabetes cases, especially among the youth, are soaring, with projections reaching <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/newsroom/news-releases/global-diabetes-cases-soar-529-million-13-billion-2050">1.3 billion cases by 2050</a>. There’s a dramatic <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/09/researchers-report-dramatic-rise-in-early-onset-cancers/">rise in cancer</a> in people under 50yo. </em></p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness">1/5 of adults</a> live with a mental illness, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness">20% of our youth</a> will experience severe mental illness before age 18. And so on, and so on.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>Yet, our health is the foundation enabling us to face not only our individual challenges but also the broader challenges our society is facing today: only in good health will we be able to tackle the many crisis that lie ahead - climate, economic, politics, and technological, including those brought on by AI. So, being healthy is more important than ever, and that’s what I wish you for the year ahead. </em></p><p><em>As we step into 2024, the signs are becoming increasingly clear: we are on the cusp of a major shift in how we approach health and wellness. I'm incredibly excited to deepen my commitment to the fields of longevity and preventative health this year – as an entrepreneur, advisor, investor (if you’re interested in collaborating, reach out!) and through this newsletter. Speaking of which, I’d love to hear from you on one thing: how can I improve this newsletter? Would you prefer more industry insights, practical health tips, or a blend of both? My favorite reads of the week? What's your ideal frequency - weekly or bi-weekly? Feel free to send me your feedback. </em></p><p><em>Now, onto content. </em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg" width="1456" height="447" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:447,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:284197,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ocz-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e846c03-6125-4305-8d2e-2c74dcce26d3_1550x476.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Longevity has never captured consumer interest as much as now.
