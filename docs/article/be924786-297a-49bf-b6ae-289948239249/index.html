        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central argument hinges on how defense contractors use taxpayer funds for stock buybacks. Understanding the mechanics, history, and controversy around share repurchases would illuminate why the author considers this a wealth transfer mechanism and why buybacks became prevalent after regulatory changes in 1982.</p>

      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Congress will decide in the coming weeks whether to approve a $1 trillion military budget for 2026.</p><p>The House-passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) proposes <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/crpt/hrpt231/CRPT-119hrpt231.pdf#page=474">$893 billion</a> in military spending, while the Senate version proposes <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/crpt/srpt39/CRPT-119srpt39.pdf#page=414">$926 billion</a>. Whichever total prevails, the White House plans to add another <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf#page=43">$119 billion</a> from the <a href="https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/sites/default/files/2025-10/What%20You%20Need%20to%20Know_Final_10.23.pdf">One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a>. All told, next year’s pending military budget stands between $1.012 trillion and $1.045 trillion.</p><p>Money is policy. Should Congress approve such a historic sum, it would not only enable many of Trump’s dangerous and unjust policies — including <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/11/11/cost-trump-national-guard-military-occupation/">military occupations</a> of US cities, the <a href="https://www.un-diplomatic.com/p/fresh-hell-unjust-nuclear-deterrence">resumption</a> of nuclear weapons testing, and rushing toward wars in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-administration-planning-new-mission-mexico-cartels-current-forme-rcna241167">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://inkstick.substack.com/p/critical-state-will-trump-launch">Nigeria</a>, and <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/venezuela/beware-slide-toward-regime-change-venezuela">Venezuela</a> — it would also trigger a historic redistribution of wealth from the public to private arms companies and their shareholders.</p><h3><strong>A looming half-trillion-dollar privatization of wealth</strong></h3><p>More than half of next year’s trillion-dollar Pentagon budget would likely go to private companies. A recent <a href="https://costsofwar.watson.brown.edu/sites/default/files/papers/Profits-of-War_Hartung-Semler_Costs-of-War_Quincy-FINAL.pdf">study</a> from Brown University’s Costs of War project found that over half of Pentagon spending from 2020 to 2024 went to for-profit contractors. For <em>Popular Information</em>, I expanded the report’s sample size by another 20 years (I should know how to do this, as I co-authored the Brown study.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>) Since 2000, 53% of Pentagon spending has gone to contracts.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> By that figure, the 2026 military budget would likely privatize well over $500 billion in public funds.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!La3i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png" width="1456" height="1245" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9794c682-5364-4bf5-aa04-d2b43ee8b4a8_1600x1368.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1245,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pentagon has spent more than $20 trillion since 2000, over half of it on contractors.

Based on their share of revenue from sales to the US government, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon (RTX), General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman used public funds to cover $103 billion in buybacks and dividends over the last decade. US taxpayers covered two out of every three dollars these companies spent enriching their shareholders.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a> This is a conservative estimate.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a></p><p>Two main factors make these billions in shareholder subsidies possible.
