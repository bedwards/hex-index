        <p><em>All about China: The week’s most important news, commentary, and links to the best writing and podcasting in English. Please take out a paid subscription to access the full archive.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>On November 4, I published a <a href="https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/notes-chinafile/new-global-scene-independent-chinese-film">short article</a> on ChinaFile about two unrelated festivals of independent Chinese cinema, quite a sunny story about signs of a blooming of Chinese culture in cities around the world. </p><p>The next day, I recorded <a href="https://www.sinicapodcast.com/p/we-were-right-kaiser-and-jeremy-reunite">an episode of the Sinica podcast with Kaiser Kuo</a>. We started Sinica together in 2010; he’s now doing it on his own, but I occasionally join as a guest. He titled the episode “We were right: Kaiser and Jeremy reunite to riff on the China vibe shift.” It’s the second show we’ve done on a really noticeable change in American attitudes to China in the last ten months or so. </p><p>I attribute the shift largely to the clown show in Washington, which makes Beijing look like the capital of global responsibility, and the Trump administration’s purge of China hawks in favor of unprincipled grifters. But there are a lot of other factors which we discuss in the show, including: American TikTok influencers dazzled by high speed trains, U.S. hypocrisy on human rights, and a softening of rhetoric coming from Beijing on the U.S. and on international issues. Whatever the cause, views of China in the U.S. seem to have warmed considerably since the nadir of  2016 to 2023 (which roughly coincides with the height of China’s strident “<a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/understanding-chinese-wolf-warrior-diplomacy/">wolf warrior diplomacy</a>”). We didn’t discuss it on the show, but there  even seemed to be some kind of warming between Beijing and Tokyo, after <a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/zyxw/202511/t20251101_11745380.html">Xi Jinping met Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on October 31</a> in South Korea.  </p><p>My typical schtick on Sinica is as the cynic who can’t help pointing out all China’s failures, the foil to Kaiser’s enthusiasm and optimism about the country. But when we recorded this episode, I shared Kaiser’s exuberance. I’d just published a fun story about Chinese film, and that day, thinking about China seemed so sunny. So much more pleasant than reading the news about the U.S. And I suppose both of us are hoping that less hostility from the U.S. might also give China a nudge in the direction of openness. </p><p>A short-lived interlude of sunniness. </p><p>The day after recording the podcast, on November 6, the New York film festival <a href="https://indiechina.org/">announced</a> ...</p>
