        <p>It’s no secret that analytics has had a greater impact on baseball than most, if not all other major sports. A leading reason for this is that the fundamental building block of any baseball event, a pitch, is a relatively isolated event. Sure, there are eight other players on the field, but it’s primarily a 1 vs. 1 interaction between a batter and a pitcher. Analysts covering other sports aren’t so lucky; basketball, football, soccer, and hockey all have an entire defensive staff that’s able to adjust its coverage of a player, and several teammates whose activity can have a positive or negative influence on a player’s output in hard-to-measure ways. The relative lack of outside factors influencing a pitching event, paired with the large sample size created by a long season, means that we can typically understand a player or team’s skill with a high degree of confidence. </p><p>Events in two different baseball games aren’t perfectly comparable, though. <strong>One significant factor that complicates our ability to compare one player’s performance to another’s is the ballpark factor</strong>. Unlike other sports, whose arenas have highly-regulated rules surrounding their dimensions, each baseball stadium is unique in its size and shape. Fenway Park’s center field fence is just 390ft. from home plate, while Minute Maid’s is much farther out at 436. <strong>Simply put, a home run in Boston may not have been a home run in Houston</strong>. The below image from Thirty81 Project's <a href="https://twitter.com/louspirito">Lou Spirito</a> is a nice depiction of the extreme variations between different ballparks’ dimensions (h/t <a href="https://twitter.com/MattMonagan">Matt Monagan</a> whose writing for <a href="https://www.mlb.com/cut4/the-dimensions-of-every-big-league-ballpark-in-this-cool-infographic/c-73642276">Cut4</a> pointed me here).
