        <p class="topic-summary">The SPICE paper introduces a self-play reinforcement learning framework for improving reasoning, which builds upon and contrasts with RLHF techniques. Understanding RLHF provides essential context for appreciating how self-play methods like SPICE represent an evolution in training paradigms.</p>
