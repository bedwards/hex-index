Since we published our rebuttal on Sunday on our respective <em>Substacks</em>, we’ve appreciated lots of positive feedback—including from several former HHS leaders who served during both the Biden <em>and </em>the first Trump administrations. (We also heard that a professor at Duke is going to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gavinyamey.bsky.social/post/3m5w3pcbfnk23">assign the piece to his students</a>, which is quite the honor.)</p><p>But we also know that our written responses were a <em>heavy lift. </em>So, we’re going to talk through the issues carefully today, for those who wish to consume this information in an audio/visual format. I’ll be sure to ask Dr. Rasmussen about her research, which has probably pinned the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic down to literally just a few cages in the live animal market in Wuhan. We’ll also make a summary of the main points afterward. And yes, we’ll uncork and rant just a bit, because, <em>hello,</em> <em>have you met us? </em>So, we’ll try to have some fun, while covering a serious topic. </p><p><strong>To join us live, <a href="https://open.substack.com/live-stream/80058?utm_source=live-stream-scheduled-upsell">click this link</a></strong> (you can watch on any device, including the <em><a href="https://substack.com/app?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_source=insidemedicine&amp;utm_content=author-post-insert">Substack</a></em><a href="https://substack.com/app?utm_campaign=app-marketing&amp;utm_source=insidemedicine&amp;utm_content=author-post-insert"> app</a>).
