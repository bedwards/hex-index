        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis is that social media has amplified social comparison, making people unhappier. This foundational psychological theory by Leon Festinger explains why humans compare themselves to others and how these comparisons affect self-evaluation and emotions.</p>

Perhaps Americans are upset about social issues and politics, and expressing this as dissatisfaction about the economy. Perhaps they’re mad that Trump seems to be trying to hurt the economy. Perhaps they’re scared that AI will take their jobs. And so on. </p><p>Here’s another hypothesis: Maybe Americans are down in the dumps because their perception of the “good life” is being warped by TikTok and Instagram. </p><p>I’ve been reading for many years about how social media would make Americans unhappier by prompting them to engage in more frequent social comparisons. In the 2010s, as happiness plummeted among young people, the standard story was that Facebook and Instagram were shoving our friends’ happiest moments in our faces — their smiling babies, their beautiful weddings, their exciting vacations — and instilling a sense of envy and inadequacy. </p><p>In fact, plenty of <a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/effect-deactivating-facebook-and-instagram-users-emotional-state">careful research</a> found that <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3919760">using Facebook and Instagram</a> made people at least <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/facebook.pdf">temporarily unhappier</a>, and there’s some evidence that social comparisons were the reason. Here’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352250X15002535">Appel et al. (2016)</a>, reviewing the literature up to that point:</p><blockquote><p>Cross-sectional evidence demonstrates a positive correlation between the amount of Facebook use and the frequency of social comparisons on Facebook…A similar pattern emerges for the impression of being inferior…Some of these studies…have documented an association between social comparison or envy and negative affective outcomes…</p><p>Causal relationships between Facebook use, social comparison, envy, and depression have also been established experimentally. For example, in a study about women's body image…women instructed to spend ten minutes looking at their Facebook page rated their mood lower than those looking at control websites. Furthermore, participants in the Facebook condition who had a strong tendency to compare their attractiveness to others were less satisfied with their physical appearance…</p><p>In summary, available evidence is largely consistent with the notion that Facebook use encourages unfavorable social comparisons and envy, which may in turn lead to depressed mood.</p></blockquote><p>Note that during the 2010s, consumer confidence was high. Even if people were comparing their babies </p></source>...</source>
