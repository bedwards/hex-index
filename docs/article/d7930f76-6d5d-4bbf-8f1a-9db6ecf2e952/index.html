        <p>Everyone is suddenly talking about “affordability.” That includes Zohran Mamdani, Donald Trump, and seemingly the entire Democratic party messaging apparatus — even GOP Senators are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/a-gop-playbook-for-an-affordability-offensive-cost-housing-groceries-healthcare-f4de8e4c?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfReTcxV6e8MES5n_m_rjOTtKZ4BOICrQD5NTShtDRCYXdUZ-Fqrz_Xh_Nmids%3D&amp;gaa_ts=692e5992&amp;gaa_sig=FkeFqfqxvDFZcKM7G1Neo6cF7QcrPzhrmP3uY8lF9FeK-zCr9iu5pm9KkUo8OunZZWv0dxh44Fnje4Od_LWInA%3D%3D">writing strategy op-eds now</a>.</p><p>Last week, a reporter from <em>The New York Times</em> called me and asked two questions about the topic. First, what do we know, if anything, about what “affordability” means to everyday voters? Does polling data offer any insights? And second, where did the word come from? Why is it all of a sudden the dominant messaging strategy for both Democrats and Republicans?</p><p>On the “what” question, I would direct readers (and did direct this reporter) to the second graph in <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/not-just-left-vs-right-most-voters">this article</a>. In my raw survey data from our <em><a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/t/strength-in-numbersverasight-poll">Strength In Numbers</a></em><a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/t/strength-in-numbersverasight-poll">/Verasight polls</a>, when people use the words “affordable” or “affordability,” they also tend to express concerns about high prices and (loosely speaking) low social mobility. High prices is not just about goods and services, but many things associated with economic (im)mobility and uncertainty about future prosperity in general. People mention groceries and rent, sure, but also health care, education, houses — and, yes, taxes. People also say affordability is about fairness and economic inequality (one respondent to a recent poll said things would be more affordable if we taxed billionaires at a higher rate). See also: this <a href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/affordability-part-i">series</a> by Paul Krugman on the subject. </p><p>But what about the why and the when? To add some data to the discourse, I’ve parsed an archive of hundreds of thousands of emails sent by members of Congress and produced a comprehensive timeline of the recent usage of the word “affordability.”</p><p>My analysis of this data reveals three things. First, Democrats really started talking about affordability after Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City in June 2025. There’s a good case to be made that the party’s subsequent blowouts in the 2025 statewide elections are due to <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/what-can-zohran-mamdani-teach-democrats?utm_source=publication-search">lessons they learned</a> from Mamdani’s campaign. </p><p>Second, data show Republicans are now playing a game of catch-up on affordability. This is best embodied by Donald Trump’s recent tweets on the subject, as well as his praise for Mamdani in the Oval Office two weeks ago. (I think Trump r<a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trumps-winning-2024-coalition-has?r=a9pj&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">ightly perceives a threat</a> from Democrats on economic anxiety.)</p><p>Third and finally, I explain how “affordability” has become the new “inflation” — a handy buzzword that captures a ...</p>
