        <p><em>Over the summer, we launched <a href="https://www.narratively.com/t/the-personals">The Personals</a>, a new series of essays about smaller — but still largely impactful —&nbsp;moments. This latest one from writer and comedian Ivy Eisenberg is an absolute delight. We felt like we were right beside Ivy as she tried to dodge her father and vie for his approval all at once.</em> <em>Check it out or listen to Ivy <strong>read it aloud in her own voice by clicking play below</strong> and on <a href="https://www.narratively.com/s/narratively-out-loud">our podcast Narratively Out Loud</a> (where you can listen to lots of our past stories read aloud!).</em> </p><div><hr></div><div class="native-audio-embed" data-component-name="AudioPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;label&quot;:null,&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;0c9c7f35-3e42-4576-8787-9ab939a1b6e2&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:699.2196,&quot;downloadable&quot;:false,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset image2-full-screen"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;full&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2352895,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.narratively.com/i/178824482?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-fullscreen" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TBU0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41ac33d9-edda-48df-8b98-f07263d7f8be_2580x1720.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Illustration by</em> <strong>Julie Benbassat</strong> | <em>Story edited by</em> <strong>Jesse Sposato </strong></figcaption></figure></div><p>Decades before GPS, my dad had the uncanny ability to hunt me down in his forest green Chevy wagon at the precise moment I was doing something questionable. I’d be engaged in some angsty teen behavior, like smoking a cigarette on my friend’s stoop or making out with a guy down the street. I’d look up and see the high beams<strong> </strong>of the wagon and my dad’s big<strong> </strong>head<strong> </strong>jutting out over the steering wheel, his shoulders hunched forward and his eyes squinting as he surveilled the surroundings like a police officer on the beat.</p><p>“Uh-oh, Ivy — here comes Lefty Louie,” one of my friends would say.
