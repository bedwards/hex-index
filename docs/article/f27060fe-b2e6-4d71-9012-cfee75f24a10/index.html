          <strong>Northrop Frye</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Frye as &#039;a very great critic&#039; and mentions a &#039;Northrop Frye-lite approach&#039; to literary criticism. Understanding Frye&#039;s archetypal criticism and his influence on the Western literary canon provides essential context for the debate about canonical standards in literature departments.</p>

          <strong>Harold Bloom</strong>
          <span class="read-time">16 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Bloom is mentioned as &#039;that notable elitist&#039; who defended the Western canon while also enjoying baseball. His controversial book &#039;The Western Canon&#039; and his battles against what he called the &#039;School of Resentment&#039; are directly relevant to this article&#039;s defense of literary elitism.</p>

          <strong>Value pluralism</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author explicitly identifies as &#039;a pluralist&#039; and argues that &#039;there are many different forms of the good&#039; that may be incommensurable. Isaiah Berlin&#039;s concept of value pluralism is the philosophical foundation for the article&#039;s argument that we can maintain canonical standards while recognizing multiple legitimate goods.</p>
