        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Arlo Guthrie having &#039;the biggest shoes to fill&#039; and references Woody&#039;s talking blues style. Understanding Woody Guthrie&#039;s enormous influence on American folk music and political songwriting provides essential context for appreciating both the weight on Arlo&#039;s shoulders and why &#039;Alice&#039;s Restaurant&#039; was such a significant achievement.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Berry Gordy, The Temptations, The Contours, and the Motown studio in discussing &#039;Do You Love Me?&#039; Understanding Motown&#039;s revolutionary role in bringing Black music to mainstream American audiences and its unique &#039;hit factory&#039; production system illuminates why the story of which group got this song matters.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Phil Spector as the benchmark for 1960s pop production. His revolutionary &#039;Wall of Sound&#039; technique defined the era&#039;s sonic aesthetic, and understanding this production philosophy helps explain why the author considers certain songs the &#039;purest encapsulation of 1960s pop.&#039;</p>

Is this true or just a conspiracy theory?</p><p>Anyway, Barbara George was another chorister who became a great R&amp;B singer. She was a teenager, married for three years, and a mother of one when she wrote and recorded her first and only album. Driven by a simple, catchy piano from its opening seconds and featuring George’s heartfelt, brassy vocals, this single deservedly became a crossover hit…and then George faded from music history as fast as she rocketed in. The ’60s, like the ’80s, were a time of one-hit wonders, and George will neither be the first nor the last on our list. I hope that, as the writer of this track, she actually got a payout. </p><h2>138 <a href="https://youtu.be/WaKIX6oaSLs">Alice’s Restaurant Massacree</a> by Arlo Guthrie (1967) </h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg" width="299" height="297.6060606060606" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:427,&quot;width&quot;:429,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:299,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Arlo Guthrie – Alice's Restaurant – Vinyl (LP, Album), [r5189370] | Discogs&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Arlo Guthrie – Alice's Restaurant – Vinyl (LP, Album), [r5189370] | Discogs" title="Arlo Guthrie – Alice's Restaurant – Vinyl (LP, Album), [r5189370] | Discogs" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tJ_2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F229baebf-ab87-4da0-a35c-705ae942bede_429x427.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I wouldn’t want every song to be like this, but I’m glad one is.</p><p>Of all second-generation musicians, Arlo Guthrie had the biggest shoes to fill (sorry, Julian Lennon), and while is output is usually competent, he had one moment of genius. Woody Guthrie played a mean talking blues, but Woody Guthrie never wove a shaggy-dog story like this—not even in those CDs of endless Alan Lomax interviews: A cute little anecdote (about littering) that blossoms into an anti-war song that potentially blossoms into a movement.

The Contours were at the Motown studio, though, so Gordy tried them out, and the rest is dance party history. </p><p>“Do You Love Me?” may be the purest encapsulation of 1960s pop of any song not produced by Phil Spector (which is perhaps weird because </p>...</source>
