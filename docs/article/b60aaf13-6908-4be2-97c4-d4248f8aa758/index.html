        <p class="topic-summary">The article references the Fourth Amendment&#039;s prohibition on &#039;unreasonable searches and seizures&#039; in the context of ICE agents &#039;going door to door.&#039; Understanding the constitutional protections, their historical origins, and how courts have interpreted them in law enforcement contexts provides essential background for evaluating the legality of current immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

We have video of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Renee_Good">the killing of Renee Good</a> in Minneapolis on January 7th, and the Washington Post has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/08/video-ice-shooting-minneapolis/">a detailed blow-by-blow analysis</a> of the video:</p><blockquote><p>In the aftermath [of the killing], Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem said [Renee Good] had committed an act of “domestic terrorism,” first disobeying officers’ commands and then weaponizing her SUV by attempting to “run a law enforcement officer over.” President Donald Trump said the woman “violently, willfully and viciously ran over the ICE officer.”</p><p>A frame-by-frame analysis of video footage, however, raises questions about those accounts. The SUV did move toward the ICE agent as he stood in front of it. But the agent was able to move out of the way and fire at least two of three shots from the side of the vehicle as it veered past him…</p><p>The agent…can be seen standing behind Good’s SUV…The agent then walks around the passenger side…[T]wo additional agents…approach Good…A voice can be heard saying to “get out” of the car at least two times. One of the agents puts a hand on the opening of the driver’s side window and with his other hand tugs twice quickly on the door handle, but the driver’s door does not open…[T]he SUV begins to back up…</p><p>The agent who was first seen behind Good’s SUV reemerges in front of the vehicle…The SUV quickly pulls forward, and then veers to the right, in the correct direction of traffic on the one-way street…As the vehicle moves forward, video shows, the agent moves out of the way and at nearly the same time fires his first shot. The footage shows that his other two shots were fired from the side of the vehicle.</p></blockquote><p>For more details surrounding the incident, and for the full video, check out <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2026/01/08/video-ice-shooting-minneapolis/">the Washington Post article</a>.
