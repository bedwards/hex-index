It found that Google harmed Epic by creating a monopoly in in-app billing and app distribution within the Android ecosystem, illegally tying the app store and its billing system together. A series of revenue-sharing deals with developers and device manufacturers were also found to harm competition.</p><p>Epic’s lawsuit was filed in 2020. Around the same time, the company sued Apple on similar grounds, claiming Apple’s app store monopoly and ban on third-party billing systems was anticompetitive and illegal. But Epic (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/24/apple-epic-appeal-app-store/">mostly</a>) lost that case, which was decided by a judge.&nbsp;</p><p>As this new trial unfolded, Sean Hollister wrote at <em>The Verge</em>, “<em>Epic v. Google</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">turned out to be a very different case</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>He continues:</p><blockquote><p>It hinged on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=This%20trial%20destroyed%20any%20notion%20that%20Google%20treats%20developers%20fairly%20and%20equally.">secret revenue sharing deals</a> between Google, smartphone makers, and big game developers, ones that Google execs internally believed were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=Google%20execs%20clearly%20wanted%20to%20block%20other%20app%20stores.">designed to keep rival app stores down</a>. It showed that Google was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap#:~:text=Google%20was%20running%20scared%20%E2%80%94%20of%20Epic%20specifically.">running scared of Epic</a> specifically. And it was all decided by a jury, unlike the Apple ruling.</p></blockquote><p>Last week Hollister wrote <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23959932/epic-v-google-trial-antitrust-play-store-fortnite-recap">a recap of the trial</a> that, in addition to exploring the many facets of each company’s arguments, serves as a highly entertaining account of Google’s app-store related chicanery over the years: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23969690/google-spotify-android-billing-commission-secret-deal">sweetheart deals</a> to favored developers like Spotify and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954852/google-netflix-app-store-deal-play-10-percent-revshare">Netflix</a>; successful efforts to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954111/google-boasted-it-got-riot-games-not-to-launch-its-own-app-store-by-offering-10m">prevent third-party app stores from launching</a>; and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23961221/were-going-old-school-back-when-google-promised-the-android-app-store-would-not-be-a-profit-center">the lies it told</a> about its app store not being designed as a profit center. (The Play Store’s profit margin in 2021 was estimated during the trial to be 71 percent.)</p><p>And Epic managed to prove all that despite operating in an environment where —&nbsp;oops! —&nbsp;much of the relevant evidence was destroyed by Google, thanks to executives’ use of a default setting in Google Chat that deleted their messages automatically after 24 hours. (The judge in the case, James Donato, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984902/judge-james-donato-investigate-google">called this </a>“the most serious and disturbing evidence I have ever seen in my decade on the bench with respect to a party intentionally suppressing </p>...</source>
