        <h2><strong>What happened</strong></h2><p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded for one of the most fundamental discoveries in modern immunology: how the body prevents its own immune system from turning against itself.</p><p>In the 1990s, Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that a small subset of T cells — now known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), act as the “brakes” of the immune system, suppressing autoimmune responses. Around the same time, Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, working at Celltech (a UK biotech company, not a university lab), identified the gene FOXP3 as the master switch for these regulatory cells. Mutations in FOXP3 caused a devastating autoimmune condition in mice, and later in humans, known as IPEX syndrome.</p><p>Together, their work uncovered the genetic and cellular machinery that maintains <strong>immune tolerance</strong> (the reason our immune system doesn’t destroy our own tissues).</p><p>One striking detail: Brunkow and Ramsdell made their discovery while working in the biotech industry. It’s one of the few Nobel Prizes ever awarded directly to industrial scientists, not academics.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Why it matters</strong></h2><p>This isn’t just a prize about immunology history. It’s a recognition that immune balance is central to health.</p><p>Most of biotech’s big wins in the past decade have come from <em>stimulating</em> the immune system — checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, mRNA vaccines. The Treg–FOXP3 story highlights the opposite side of immunity: the mechanisms that keep activation in check. FOXP3 doesn’t suppress immunity broadly; it restores the body’s ability to <em>regulate</em> itself.</p><p>The importance of this pathway becomes clearest in a rare condition called IPEX syndrome, a genetic disorder where FOXP3 is missing or nonfunctional. Without FOXP3, people are born without regulatory T cells, the <em>peacekeepers</em> that normally stop the immune system from attacking its own tissues. The result is catastrophic: early, widespread autoimmunity that can destroy the gut, pancreas, and skin within months of birth.</p><p>Recently, researchers have begun using cell and gene therapies to restore FOXP3, essentially giving patients back their immune “peacekeepers.” For the first time, these therapies are re-establishing immune balance in humans who previously had none. It’s a striking demonstration of how a Nobel-winning discovery has already turned into real, living medicine.</p><p>And it’s also a win for biotech itself. The Nobel Committee explicitly credited discoveries made inside a company, at Celltech, signaling that foundational science can come from industry labs, not just academia.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The big picture</strong></h2><p>The science of immune tolerance has quietly become one ...</p>
