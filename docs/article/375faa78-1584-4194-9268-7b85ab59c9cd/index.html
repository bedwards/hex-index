        <p>We have published quite a few articles by <a href="https://en.genomics.cn/team/info.aspx?itemid=1923">Mei Yonghong</a>. This long-time government official turned biotech executive sits at a rare and interesting intersection of Beijing’s science bureaucracy and China’s private genomics sector, giving him an unusually system-wide view of how China’s S&amp;T ambition collides with U.S.-led tech controls, seen not from academia but from inside a company under intense external pressure.</p><p>Before becoming director and executive vice-president of China’s private <a href="https://en.genomics.cn/">BGI Group</a>, one of the world’s leading genomics organisations and a “biotechnology company of concern” in Washington’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8333/text">parlance</a>, Mei served as mayor of Jining in Shandong province from 2010 to 2015, and earlier, held senior posts at China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, including deputy director-general of the General Office, director-general of the Research Office, and director-general of the Department of Policy, Regulation, and System Reform.</p><p>Mei <a href="http://ddzg.ciids.cn/trends/5250.html">delivered</a> the following remarks on 1 December during the <a href="http://en.ddzg.ciids.cn/">2025 Understanding China Conference</a>, an annual forum held under the auspices of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and convened each year after the conclusion of a plenary session of the CPC Central Committee or a CPC National Congress. </p><p>In his speech, Mei argued that U.S.-led decoupling has exposed how dependent China remains on Western tools, equipment, and data, turning the tech stand-off into a structural clash “unseen in a century” between American technological hegemony and China’s sovereign right to develop. Yet he insists China should neither retreat from global engagement nor accept a permanent follower role, arguing instead that it can now act as a major contributor of knowledge, a transferor of technology to the Global South and an organiser of “big science” projects that will help shape the next phase of global innovation.</p><p>—Yuxuan Jia</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450" width="800" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;33_0005_6.jpg&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;33_0005_6.jpg&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="33_0005_6.jpg" title="33_0005_6.jpg" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u_-l!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7709db61-93fa-4689-ae8a-a4da7fd28d39_800x450 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>These remarks were originally <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Uj9rBAV7H1X5C3jOYSpwAQ">published</a> on 4 November on the official WeChat blog of Huagu Biotechnology and Bioindustry Research Institute, a non-governmental, non-profit think tank <a href="https://wglh.com/stock/comment/2043103/">set up in 2023 </a>by biotech and agricultural companies in China, including BGI’s affiliates. </p><h1><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Uj9rBAV7H1X5C3jOYSpwAQ">梅永红：坚持科技对外开放——在2025读懂中国国际会议上的演讲</a></h1><h1>Mei Yonghong: Stay Committed to S&amp;T Opening Up—Speech at the 2025 Understanding China Conference</h1><p>China’s scientific and technological development is facing profound changes.
