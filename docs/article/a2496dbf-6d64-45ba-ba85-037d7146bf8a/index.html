        <p>Without question, Gertrude Stein was one of the most influential writers of the past century. And thanks to the three guests on this episode—Francesa Wade (<em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781982186012">Gertrude Stein: An Afterlife</a></em>) and Cecilia Konchar Farr &amp; Janie Sisson (<em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628974584">As I Was Saying: A Companion to Gertrude Stein’s </a></em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628974584">The Making of Americans</a>)—along with the forthcoming Dalkey Essentials edition of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628974669">The Making of Americans</a></em>, Stein is having a moment. To celebrate these three books, we discuss Stein’s literary reputation, why people are “afraid” to read <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628974669">The Making of Americans</a></em>, the role that being a lesbian woman has played in her general reception, the influence she’s had since her passing, and Leo Katz’s long, illuminating conversations with Alice Toklas after Stein’s passing. A very upbeat, exciting podcast about a writer who was way ahead of her time.</p><p>This episode’s music is “Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano” by John Cage (who sites Stein as an influence), performed by Orlando Bass in Vienna at the Konzertsaal @ Das MuTh, during the Impulstanz festival. 02/08/2022.</p><p>You can subscribe to the Mining the Dalkey Archive podcast at <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mining-the-dalkey-archive-podcast/id1775814979">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/273wx9fw2NSq2ouu7pq4xe?si=5adcadd92a9245ed">Spotify</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts, and watch us on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dalkeyarchivepress7792">YouTube</a>.</p><p>And be sure to follow our sister podcasts: Two Month Review (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/two-month-review/id1778714238">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2TYhaWf5VI6OdNOECTYvoK?si=681ae7d075d0448d">Spotify</a>) and Three Percent (<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/three-percent-podcast/id1796874029">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/36YkgVsBffAq56Wz1td0vd?si=82f1f6fa8bca40e8">Spotify</a>) for more book talk!</p>
