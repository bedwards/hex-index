The brain. </p><p>Computer scientists have long had the desire to replicate the brain. But why? What is so special about the brain? Aren't computers just better?</p><p>Computer scientists have long admired the brain's ability to function at very low energy. The brain operates at about 12 to 20 watts of power - 20% of the body's metabolic rate. </p><p>The desktop computer on the other hand does about 175 watts. Leading edge AI accelerators like the Nvidia H100 use anything from 300 to 700 watts. </p><p>The brain also does not operate at a very fast pace - with a clock frequency of about 10 hertz. Though this varies depending on what the person is doing at the time and their mental state. </p><p>So the brain does not use a lot of power and doesn't operate very quickly. And yet it is capable of so much. </p><p>Imagine a bee. A bee's brain has less than a million neurons and runs on less than a watt of power. And yet it can fly. It can navigate to flowers and back home. It can socialize and maybe even calculate things. </p><p>A bee's brain is just as capable as a 18 billion transistor system on chip, and it can do all that with just a million neurons and virtually no power. </p><p>Perhaps we should start using brains and not silicon chips for learning? Oh wait ... </p><p>The biological brain's powerful capabilities - achieved at low power - is the single most significant motivation for building neuromorphic hardware today. </p><h2>Insane Parallelism </h2><p>A brain accomplishes these with parallelism. </p><p>Your brain's 86 billion neurons operate without a central clock. By which I ...</p>
