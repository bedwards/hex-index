        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references &#039;neoliberal reforms launched by Jimmy Carter, Margaret Thatcher, and Boris Yeltsin&#039; as a key driver of the return to 1920s-era economic conditions. Understanding the specific policies and ideology behind neoliberalism is essential context for the author&#039;s argument about capitalism&#039;s role in climate crisis response.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article cites &#039;IPCC AR6&#039; as the source for its climate projections of 2-4°C warming and agricultural yield declines. This comprehensive scientific report provides the empirical foundation for the article&#039;s climate claims and represents the current scientific consensus.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central argument hinges on predictions of &#039;tens and hundreds of millions&#039; of climate migrants by 2050-2100 overwhelming existing political systems. Understanding the current research, projections, and historical precedents for climate-driven displacement provides crucial context for evaluating this thesis.</p>

Historically, a battered state has been the most reliable aid to help people get serious about the problem.</p><p>But between doomerism and optimism there is another, probably the most probable, and perhaps the most terrifying option: of course, climate change may not lead to the extinction of all people—but it can supercharge all existing social and international contradictions to the point where the disintegration of existing social institutions and economic relations will make them unsuitable for the necessary collective action, and the current level of socio-technological development, which now allows for the further progress of civilization, will begin to degrade—and take with it the possibility of further progress, thereby depriving humanity, even when most of it is still here, of a future.</p><h3>We are being gaslit about depopulation…</h3><p>Concerns about fertility and population size—and the resulting worries about sperm counts and testosterone levels in men, and women’s reproductive rights—have become commonplace in Western discourse. Yet, despite intense gaslighting in media and “new media,” the planet’s population has been growing and continues to grow, reaching 8 billion in November 2022, and around 8.26 billion as of late 2025. According to UN projections (World Population Prospects 2024), humanity will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion, then stabilize near 10.2 billion by 2100—promising 2 billion more humans than today for those who already feel short on people.</p><p>Having said that, there is no such thing as an inherently good or bad change in human population: as long as everyone can afford as many children as they want, no one is forced to have children against their will, and every child is provided with a happy childhood by society, then whichever direction the human population goes and at what number the Earth’s population stabilizes—9 or 11, 5 ...</p>
