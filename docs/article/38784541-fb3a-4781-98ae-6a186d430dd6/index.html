The distinction between the two places has been erased by the yawning expansion of the Dallas metroplex. You can use different names if it makes you feel better, but zoom out on a map of that ample concrete blot on Northeast Texas and you will see the truth. From Forth Worth to Garland, from Denton to Waxahachie, from Arlington to Mckinney, it’s all Dallas. If your town is not part of Dallas yet, just wait.</p><p>Three of the five fastest growing <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025/vintage-2024-popest.html">cities</a> in America are Dallas exurbs. The fastest growing city of all, with more than 30% population growth last year, was Princeton, Texas, an hour’s drive north of downtown Dallas. If you’re curious, you can hop right on the Sam Rayburn Tollway and see the future.</p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><p>As you drive, for miles and miles, you will see road crews of hardworking men in bright yellow vests driving backhoes. They are all building new roads, bigger roads, to take more people out to Princeton. And, one day, beyond! All of these hardworking men are earning the money necessary for them—or, perhaps, their kids—to buy a home just like the ones that you can see other crews of men building in the places that the roads are going to. This square deal can keep reproducing itself, as far as Texans are concerned, forever.</p><p>As you sit in your car on all of those highways, you might wonder: Why not build the actual <em>places</em> where the <em>roads</em> are? Then you wouldn’t need the roads, since you would already be in the place. Well, if they did that, the whole system would collapse. Don’t think like that.</p><p>Go through downtown Princeton, which isn’t much, past the gas stations, past the twin US and Texas flags of truly staggering size next to a car dealership, out to the edge of the youngest neighborhoods in America. The farthest possible newly built cul-de-sac. It’s on Colgate Circle in a development called Monticello Park. Like the other Monticello, it is made of bricks. Unlike the other Monticello, it is a maze of quasi-identical homes in various shades of dirt, with four-bedrooms available under $400k. The neighborhood is half-occupied, even as </p>...</source>
