This makes Meta the second tech giant after Amazon to mandate a 5-day RTO. Will more big companies do the same?</p></li><li><p><strong>Are senior engineers better with AI than juniors are?</strong> Data from more than 40,000 users of Cursor suggests that experienced devs get better results from AI agents. It suggests the tool amplifies coding skills – not replace them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Industry Pulse. </strong>OpenAI dumps Mixpanel after security breach, Stripe buys usage metering startup, OpenAI’s “Code Red,” a high-risk security issue at a $3B legal startup, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anthropic and Claude Code on a roll. </strong>Claude Code just surpassed $1B in annual run rate revenue after 6 months, Anthropic buys JavaScript runtime Bun, and might plan to go public as soon as next year.</p></li></ol><h2>1.
