        <p><em>AUTHOR’S NOTE: I have found myself enduring the happy problem of a fresh vocab word providing way more interesting exploration and research than I expected. Therefore, I have to take some more time on it. (No spoilers!) And so, please to enjoy this re-post of my rant about toxic realism in theatre. I’ll be keeping this one largely unchanged, unless I have something really important and current to add, or I find a typo. I’ll also be keeping it in its original 2-part format, too, so. Enjoy <strong>Realism</strong> today, and <strong>Method</strong> (part 2) next week! And Happy Holidays!</em></p><div><hr></div><p>The following rant is based on a (solo) panel presentation given at Page 23’s online LitCon in 2020. Adapted for today’s… /gestures widely/. I talked a bunch and I had cool purple-bordered powerpoint slides, so what I’ve done is to use each slide title as article subtitles here, and will likely use some if not all of the images I had on those slides, though I may find more/different ones that have become relevant in the three years since I did this presentation. Oh, and! As I’ve been filling this skeleton out and adding all the relevant info, I’ve noticed it’s gotten a mite bit long. So I’m a gonna do this rant in two parts. The first is here, called <strong>REALISM</strong>. Next week, stay tuned for Part Two, which I’ll call <strong>METHOD</strong>. Strap in, jokers! <em>On y va</em>…!</p><p><em>OPENING NOTE: I use the word ‘actor’ for anyone who acts. I don’t gender the word into ‘actor’ and ‘actress,’ as the latter is what’s considered the diminutive form of the noun, and, well. As an actor myself, I don’t cotton to being a diminutive version of the ‘real’ thing. So. Don’t get confused by any genders being referred to: here, ‘actor’ means he, she, and they.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Toxic Realism: How ‘Method’ acting is a dangerous jok(er)</h3><h4>Part 1: Realism</h4><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png" width="656" height="492" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:656,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mdxb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a9b814a-9bc0-4ee9-af7a-1e9c77f2239f_1000x750.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">One of these portrayals can be considered good acting.
