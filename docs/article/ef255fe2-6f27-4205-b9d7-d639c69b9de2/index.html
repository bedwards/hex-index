        <h2></h2><h2>What City Observatory Did This Week</h2><p><a href="https://cityobservatory.org/a-bridge-too-short-again/">A bridge too low, again</a>. Just as a decade ago, the Oregon and Washington highway departments are trying to build a bridge across the Columbia River that is too low, likely wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and possibly dooming a major infrastructure project. The fact is: You can’t build a bridge across a navigable waterway in the United States without a permit from the US Coast Guard.</p><p>The Coast Guard has always been clear that it wants a 178 foot clearance over the Columbia River for any new crossing. With any shorter proposal, IBR is legally “proceeding at its own risk.”</p><p>The Interstate Bridge Replacement Project has always believed it could bully the Coast Guard into approving a much lower fixed span, and its combination of arrogance and hubris, have delayed, and once again threaten to kill this project.</p><p>The IBR is years behind schedule with its environmental review and has as yet failed to submit a new navigation impact report which it needs to trigger a Coast Guard reconsideration of the navigation requirements.</p><p>The IBR project schedule says it will take more than 16 months from the filing of a new navigation impact report until they receive a bridge permit, which would push the project start well in to 2027. By then, key federal grants, worth more than $2 billion, could expire, dooming the project.</p><h3>Must Read</h3><p><a href="http://“Density matters” as a positive economic and cultural advantage, Florida said. “Certain places stand out as the best magnets for talent. … Some people may not live in these big cities, these dominant centers, but even with digital technology, they have to come back there occasionally.” Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told me that “density is absolutely essential to economic success, urban vitality and such sources of dynamism as regional industry clusters and tech ecosystems.”">Jon Talton on the importance of urban density to economic success</a>. Writing in the Seattle Times, Talton explains how the economy of cities benefits from the concentrations of talent in place. He quotes Richard Florida as saying “Density matters” as a positive economic and cultural advantage, “certain places stand out as the best magnets for talent. … Some people may not live in these big cities, these dominant centers, but even with digital technology, they have to come back there occasionally.” He also cites Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution: “density is absolutely essential to economic success, urban vitality and such sources of dynamism as regional industry clusters and tech ecosystems.”</p><h3>In the News</h3><p><a href="https://www.clarkcountytoday.com/opinion/opinion-federal-funding-for-i-5-bridge-replacement-project-in-jeopardy/">Clark County Today</a> republished our commentary on the growing likelihood that the Trump Administration will pull the plug on $2.1 billion in federal grants for the Interstate Bridge Replacement Project.</p>
