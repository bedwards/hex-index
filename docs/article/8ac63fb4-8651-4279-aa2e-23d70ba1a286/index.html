The basic feature of the "culture of complaint" is thus a call, addressed at the big Other, to intervene and to set things straight (to recompense the damaged sexual or ethnic minority, etc.)—how, exactly, is this to be done is again a matter of different ethico-legal "committees." Is thus the "culture of complaint" not today's version of hysteria, of the hysterical impossible demand addressed to the Other, a demand which effectively wants to be rejected, since the subject grounds his/her existence in his/her complaint—"I am insofar as make the Other responsible and/or guilty for my misery"? The gap is here insurmountable between this logic of complaint and the true "radical" ("revolutionary") act which, instead of complaining to the Other and expecting it to act, i.e., displacing the need to act onto it, suspends the existing legal frame and itself accomplishes the act... So what is wrong with the complaint of those who are really deprivileged? The fact that, instead of undermining the position of the Other, they still address themselves to it: by way of translating their demand into the terms of legalistic complaint, they confirm the Other in its position in the very gesture of attacking it.</p><p>Furthermore, a wide scope of phenomena (the resurgent ethico/religious "fundamentalisms" which advocate a return to the Christian patriarchal division of sexual roles; the New Age massive re-sexualization of the universe, i.e., the return to pre-modern pagan sexualized cosmo-ontology; the growth of "conspiracy theories" as a form of popular "cognitive </p>...</source>
