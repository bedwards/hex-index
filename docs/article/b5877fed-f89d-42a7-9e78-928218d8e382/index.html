I will not take claims about the consequences of AI seriously as long as they take the form of you telling me <strong>what you believe will happen in the future</strong><em>. </em>I will seriously entertain <strong>evidence-backed observations</strong>, not <strong>speculative predictions</strong>.  That’s it. That’s the rule; that’s the law. That’s the ethic, the discipline, the mantra, the creed, the holy book, the catechism. Show me what AI is <strong>currently doing. </strong>Show me! I’m putting down my marker here because I’d like to get out of the AI discourse business for at least a year - it’s thankless and pointless - so let me please leave you with that as a suggestion for how to approach AI stories moving forward. <strong>Show, don’t tell, prove, don’t predict</strong>.</p><div><hr></div><p>There are several different kinds of AI psychosis going on right now. The big one is, well, everyone has lost their fucking minds about AI, in a way I find truly disturbing. Another one that I have not seen anyone really comment on is a kind of second-order meta-psychosis: people keep talking about a media world that’s full of AI skepticism (often “leftist AI skeptics”) when, in fact, a vast majority of people in media have accepted wild predictions about AI forever altering human existence, imminently, for which they can provide no material evidence whatsoever. I read things by people in the AI development world itself, I read tech and gadget media people, I read business journalists, I read polemicists, I read wonks, I read liberals, I read conservatives, I read AI-generated summaries that Google flashes in front of my face against my will, I trawl through the comments sections, I watch YouTube videos, I listen to podcasts - the notion that the media, or the discourse, or the public consciousness is generally skeptical is totally foreign to me. I don’t know what planet you guys are living on. Yes, there are a handful of well-known skeptics like <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/">Gary Marcus</a>. They are absolutely dwarfed by the number of people who think AI is going to forever change the fundamentals of human existence and quite soon. I honestly think people are developing this idea of an army of skeptics from random </p>...</source>
