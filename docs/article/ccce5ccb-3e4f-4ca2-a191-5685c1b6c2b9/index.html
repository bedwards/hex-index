        <p class="topic-summary">The article emphasizes Houston&#039;s historic 40.6% offensive rebound rate as their defining tactical innovation.

At 10–3, with the NBA’s <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced-leaders">best offense</a>, they’ve validated their loudest optimists and, so far, silenced their biggest skeptics, with their biggest test since their opening-night OT loss to OKC set to come tonight against Denver.</p><p>The Rockets were the NBA’s “surprise team” last season, blowing by Vegas’s preseason win total of <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2025_preseason_odds.html">43.5</a> and climbing to second in a crowded Western Conference before getting bounced in a bruising seven-game series against Golden State. By my estimation, they’ve played their rebuilding hand quite optimally: tanking <a href="https://www.thedreamshake.com/2023/4/10/23676089/final-reflections-houston-rockets-tank-job-rafael-stone-jalen-green-jabari-smith-victor-wembanyama">when necessary</a>, stacking prospects, signing veterans, and capitalizing on their players’ development at the right moments.</p><div id="datawrapper-iframe" class="datawrapper-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7g0AJ/2/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b6c3ba8-566a-46da-b565-5bbfb5f69024_1220x684.png&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url_full&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4023aeb9-8330-4a86-b051-29bc98ae856f_1220x866.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:423,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Rockets are back in business&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-component-name="DatawrapperToDOM"><iframe id="iframe-datawrapper" class="datawrapper-iframe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7g0AJ/2/" width="730" height="423" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Zooming outward, this is really as much as you can ask for since James Harden decided to force his way to Brooklyn five years ago. While some teams that lose a major star <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%9323_Utah_Jazz_season">spend years bouncing around in NBA purgatory</a>, the Rockets have parlayed a series of smaller moves into a relatively quick path to contention. Houston even made a mediumish-risk, highish-reward splash this summer, trading Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green for Kevin Durant. Durant hasn’t been <em>spectacular</em>, but he’s been healthy and good, and along with Alperen Şengün and Amen Thompson, gives the Rockets three players who rank in the top 35 in the league in <a href="https://dunksandthrees.com/epm">EPM</a>.</p><p>The Rockets have also embraced some unconventional tactics. Last season, they leaned heavily on Steven Adams’ offensive rebounding to generate second-chance points — the team grabbed an astonishing 43.9 percent of offensive rebounds when Adams was on the floor. This year, they’ve doubled down on size, playing Sengun and Adams in more minutes together. They’ve even supplemented the double bigs with Durant and Jabari Smith, creating further supersized lineups. The result is a 40.6 percent offensive rebound rate so far, a multiple-standard-deviation outlier relative to the rest of the league, and on track to be the highest rate in NBA history.</p><div id="datawrapper-iframe" class="datawrapper-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2KhYa/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/609964eb-bcb9-4d19-9bdd-cdd5a07aff98_1220x1360.png&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url_full&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e914ac4d-3cec-4458-aed1-453c81956c82_1220x1688.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:835,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Houston has dominated the offensive glass in back-to-back seasons&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Offensive rebounding strength is measured by a team's share of available team offensive rebounds while on the floor.&quot;}" data-component-name="DatawrapperToDOM"><iframe id="iframe-datawrapper" class="datawrapper-iframe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2KhYa/1/" width="730" height="835" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It’s hard to believe that just five years ago, the Rockets were running full-on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pASdlr1zHY">Micro Ball</a> with Russell Westbrook and James Harden.
