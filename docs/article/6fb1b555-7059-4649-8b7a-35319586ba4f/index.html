        <p>Hello, and welcome to the second edition of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on McLennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. The launch of this newsletter has already been a smashing success with over 2,000 subscribers, and we’re just getting started. As I continue to build this platform, I strongly encourage you to subscribe (if you haven’t already) and share my content on social media. We’ve got a lot of great things in store, and I don’t want anyone to miss a thing. </p><p>As we get closer to the March 1st Democratic Primary, I will be conducting interviews with candidates for local and statewide office to learn more about their background, discuss their platform, and find out how they plan to benefit Central Texans. In anticipation of some of these interviews, I would love to hear what questions y’all might have for these candidates. Stay tuned for details on how to be a part of the process.</p><p>Lastly, I feel that I would be committing malpractice if I didn't write something about Beto running for governor. I have been very excited about his announcement for some time, but I also have a healthy level of skepticism. I think it is important that we are aware of the pros and cons of any candidate so that we can have the full picture.</p><p>But first, let’s look at the news!</p><h4>Week in review (a collection of articles from Waco, Texas, and beyond)</h4><p><strong>Waco:</strong></p><p>I know it isn’t political, but I’m going to say it anyways: Baylor has won the Big 12 Championship. <strong>Sic’ Everything.</strong> </p><p><a href="https://c0085050-61f2-4358-9db7-bc1127498264.filesusr.com/ugd/e43c1a_0888a249e96c4ce6a243f46d38e2c1de.pdf">Prosper Waco released its Waco Snapshot Report,</a> which provides an in-depth analysis of human flourishing in the City of Waco. The report looks at the following data sets: population and income, education, housing, health, labor &amp; economic development, and connectivity. Some of the main takeaways: Waco has significant economic and ethnic inequality, where you live is a big determining factor of your wellbeing, and our city underperforms peer cities on most metrics. I would recommend taking a good look at this report and then sending it straight to your local elected officials. This needs to be a template for policy making over the next decade (and beyond). </p><p><strong>If you’re a Waco ISD resident,</strong> you’re probably aware of some of the concerns surrounding the G.W. Carver/Indian Springs Middle Schools merger, <a href="https://wacotrib.com/opinion/letters/letters-indian-spring-carver-school-merger-is-a-disaster/article_641ae33e-2236-11ec-b8d0-9b841f17cd71.html">one of the main ones being student safety.</a> ...</p>
