Will their absence make any difference?</p><p>Faithful readers of this Substack may recall that I’ve criticized the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)—known informally as the Nation’s Report Card—which regularly tests a representative sample of U.S. students in reading, math, and other subjects. (See, for example, <a href="https://nataliewexler.substack.com/p/why-im-not-writing-about-naep-reading">here</a> and <a href="https://nataliewexler.substack.com/p/how-to-improve-the-naep-reading-test">here</a>.) So they might think I would be cheering the recently announced decision to cancel administrations of a number of those tests. They would be wrong, for reasons I’ll explain in a minute.</p><p>But first: what exactly has been canceled? Not the biannual reading and math tests that make headlines and are mandated by Congress—or at least, not officially. As <a href="https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-smaller-naep/">reported by Jill Barshay</a> in the Hechinger Report, those tests are still on the schedule, but DOGE-mandated cuts to the U.S. Department of Education have cast doubt on the department’s ability to administer them, as planned, next year.</p><p>Officially, the only tests that have been scrapped are some lesser known ones in science, U.S. history, and writing, along with some state- and district-level results. In addition, a test designed to measure long-term trends, going back to the 1970s, has been consigned to the dustbin.</p><p>Members of the board that sets policy for the NAEP told Barshay they’re trying to maintain standards for a smaller number of tests, given budget constraints. Those constraints aren’t new, having previously resulted in the postponement of the writing test to 2032—a timeline that would have left a 21-year gap since its previous administration in 2011. But now, in the era of vanishing government resources, we may never see another national writing test again.</p><h4>The Reading Test Is the Problem</h4><p>Here’s why I’m not cheering these cuts: The test I have found fault with is the reading test, which is still (theoretically) going to be administered every two years. That test is a problem because, like all reading comprehension tests, <a href="https://nataliewexler.substack.com/p/whatever-model-you-use-reading-tests">it perpetuates</a> the mistaken idea that you can test reading comprehension in the abstract—which leads to the <a href="https://nataliewexler.substack.com/p/why-were-teaching-reading-comprehension">equally mistaken assumption</a> that you can <em>teach</em> reading comprehension in the abstract, divorced from any particular text or content.</p><p>That approach to comprehension instruction may not be the only reason NAEP reading scores have been stagnant or declining for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/04/-american-students-reading/557915/">over two decades now</a>—and that the gap between high- and low-scorers has widened.
