        <p>Sapiens, how are you?</p><p>I greatly enjoyed all the responses to<a href="https://technosapiens.substack.com/p/will-it-be-a-boy-or-a-girl"> our recent post</a> about whether some families are more likely to have all boys or all girls.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Lots of discussion of “sibship size” and your stories of families with 5, 6, or more kids all of the same sex (!).</p><p>On my end, I’ve reached the stage of pregnancy where strangers look at my very round belly and reference a beach ball<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> multiple times per day. </p><p>Which, speaking of <em>round</em>, leads us to this month’s research roundup! [I’m sorry. I couldn’t resist].</p><p>Today we’ve got: </p><ul><li><p>New research from my lab on teens’ social media experiences</p></li><li><p>The latest data on adults’ support for school cell phone bans</p></li><li><p>And a bonus for paying subscribers: a new study on infant crying and nighttime wakeups, plus some fun footnotes</p></li></ul><p>Let’s get to it!</p><h2><strong>1. From my lab: on social media, teens are…having fun?</strong></h2><p>We hear a lot about teens’ “social media use” as if its some amorphous blob lurking behind their screens, never stopping to think about what’s <em>actually </em>happening on there. So, what kinds of experiences are teens having on social media? And how is it affecting their emotions day-to-day?</p><p>In this study, my colleagues and I set out to find the answer. For 15 days, we<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> texted 94 early teens (ages 12 to 15) with 3-5 short surveys everyday. We asked them about a range of positive and negative social media experiences they might have had in the past couple hours, as well as how they were feeling at the moment.</p><p>Here are the highlights:</p><ul><li><p>Teens reported more frequent positive than negative social media experiences</p></li><li><p>When teens reported more positive social media experiences at a given moment, they also reported more positive emotions at that moment. Same thing with negative experiences and negative emotions.</p></li><li><p>But social media experiences did not predict any <em>future </em>emotions, suggesting either that these effects are very short-lived, or that social media use isn’t actually causing the changes in emotion</p></li></ul><p><strong>My take: </strong>This study is incredibly innovative, well-run, importa—oh, what’s that? I might be a little biased? Fine. But if you’ll indulge me, here’s what I find to be one of the most interesting aspects of the paper: the number of teens reporting negative social media experiences (surprisingly low!) and positive social media experiences (surprisingly high!) during the 15-day study period.</p><p>Over the ...</p>
