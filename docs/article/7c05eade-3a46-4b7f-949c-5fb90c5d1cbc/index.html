Lewis</code></a></strong></p></blockquote><p>I have always been apprehensive about stating one truth about myself. This apprehension arises every time someone asks me, especially in the situation of a job interview, what are my strengths and weaknesses. While I have been able to give the answers quite convincingly, I usually never tell people that my greatest strength is that I am selfish with my time. </p><p>Writing this piece has helped me ponder on the reasons that I hold back from this confession. I use the word <em>confession</em> intentionally because accepting this notion that I am selfish, at some level feels like a minor crime. So after some introspection, I was able to get down to the root cause of this feeling of apprehension. </p><p>Growing up, I was always told and taught to be selfless, caring, and community bound. For a ton of reasons that teaching was right. From understanding what it means to have a collective thought process that is inclusive of everybody, to being there for one another in the good and bad times, this method did teach me a great deal. However, this teaching and lifestyle of being selfless also meant that I put others first. That means I put myself second or third, if not last. </p><p>As I got older this teaching started conflicting with my beliefs and priorities. For once I was choosing to be selfish and think of myself first, and not second or third. When I started understanding the relevance of time, that is when I began to get more and more selfish about it. Most of us always chase financial freedom. I too was included in that list for the longest time. Instead what we should be chasing is <strong>freedom of time</strong>. </p><blockquote><p><strong><code>The freedom to do whatever it is you want with your life, whenever you want. </code></strong></p></blockquote><p>Before I get into the reasons why it is important to be selfish with your time, I would like to share a perspective I came across in a Tim Ferris Podcast, where Graham Duncan quantifies Time in a very fascinating way. This thought of his validated my belief of being selfish with my time to a whole new level. </p><h2>The concept of Time Billionaires</h2><p>Graham said, “People don't really </p>...</source>
