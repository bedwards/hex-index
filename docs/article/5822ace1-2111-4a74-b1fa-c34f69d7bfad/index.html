        <p>I found myself strikingly saddened by the death of James Van Der Beek this week. I had no idea he was ill and hadn’t been following him closely on recent seasons of “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars.” </p><p>But I am the exact age for both “Dawson’s Creek” and “Varsity Blues” to have been formative, foundational content experiences. Beyond that, I’m a <em>huge</em> fan of his work in the short-lived sitcom “Don’t Trust the B— in Apartment 23.” That whole show was criminally underrated, but Van Der Beek’s performance was particularly inspired. Check this out: </p><div id="youtube2-xozzPP4Y8RA" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;xozzPP4Y8RA&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xozzPP4Y8RA?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>At any rate, cancer is a scourge. The good news is that we have gotten much better over time at treating it, and <a href="https://www.update.news/p/why-we-should-think-more-like-economists?open=false#§why-its-good-news-that-more-people-are-dying-of-cancer">age-specific cancer death rates</a> have fallen by more than 20 percent since 1980. But that doesn’t make the exceptions any less sad.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/matthewyglesias/p/sunday-thread-mailbag-1d9?utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;comments=true&amp;commentId=211770205">lindamc:</a> Do you ever want to take a break from take-slinging and just </strong><em><strong>not</strong></em><strong> form an opinion on an issue?</strong></p><p>I think it’s underrated that there are all kinds of issues I have no opinion on. I mentioned this last week, but an interesting question is why beef prices have soared so much recently. This is something I see some people expressing a very strong opinion about, like the idea that meatpacker consolidation is to blame, but when I’ve looked into the issue I’m not convinced by that hypothesis. Still, <em>something</em> is happening and I’m not sure what. I don’t like this! I would like to know what’s happening. So I’m not writing takes about this since I don’t know the answer, but in a way, no, I don’t really ever want to “take a break” and just let it go. I want to know the truth. </p><p><strong><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/matthewyglesias/p/sunday-thread-mailbag-1d9?utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;comments=true&amp;commentId=211767313">Brian:</a> Matt, I fully agree with you that progressives overrate the role of identity in electability in a way that leads them to overrate the electoral prospects of white males. However, I think your <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/gavin-newsom-is-very-similar-to-kamala">comparison of Gavin Newsom to Kamala Harris</a> is off and discounts the strengths that Newsom brings relative to Harris. Newsom is a talented extemporaneous speaker, whereas Harris is not. Newsom routinely does long interviews in which he holds his own, skillfully combining memorized bits with off-the-cuff riffs, along with a joke here and there that disarms you.</strong></p><p><strong>[</strong><em><strong>The question continues but that’s the flavor</strong></em><strong>]</strong></p><p>I am slightly of two minds in discussions of these kinds ...</p>
