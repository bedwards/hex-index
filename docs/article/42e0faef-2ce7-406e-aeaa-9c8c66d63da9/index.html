      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I hope your week is off to a great start! The past few days, I’ve been digging into the Spinocerebellar ataxia type 4 (SCA4) literature, inspired by a new <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01719-5">Nature</a></em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01719-5"> </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01719-5">Genetics</a></em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01719-5"> paper</a> on the successful mapping of the causative gene and mutation underlying SCA4. I've read this work last year when it was <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.26.23297560v1">preprinted</a> and <a href="https://x.com/doctorveera/status/1718849291463037079">tweeted</a> about it. I've mentioned this preprint in a couple of my past substack posts in relation to long-read sequencing, and discussed it in the <a href="https://podcasts.bcast.fm/e/1836111n-ep-115-the-biggest-stories-of-2023-with-dr-veera-rajagopal-part-2">Genetics podcast </a>with Patrick Short. But rereading the paper in its final published form helped me see that there are more interesting things buried in the SCA4 literature, which I didn't notice before. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UOFn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp" width="568" height="568" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4fc48d09-2360-495c-9c7c-4c82a3720163_1024x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:568,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A creative illustration featuring DNA strands intricately intertwined with symbols associated with Mormon pioneers.

With the recent advancements such as long-read sequencing, single-cell sequencing etc., researchers are beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration (for example, cell type specific somatic expansions of repeats and how they kill the striatal neurons in Huntington's disease) and ways to prevent them (for example, targeting DNA repair genes to halt the pathological repeat expansion). So, I might be digging more into the repeat-expansion literature in the near future. </p><p>The fact about SCA4 that caught my attention was that its cause remained a mystery for more than 25 years due to high complexity of the SCA4 locus (16q22.1), and then long-read sequencing technology helped scientists to identify the disease gene (<em>ZFHX3</em>) and mutation (expanded GGC repeats). But there is more to the story. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png" width="596" height="501.4423076923077" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1225,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:596,&quot;bytes&quot;:514585,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!RS5c!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6894265-c54c-4aac-9804-74df7e5d78fc_1624x1366.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Fig 1c from Figueroa, Gross, Buena-Atienza, et al. <em>Nat Gen 2024</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>At least four independent groups have successfully mapped the GGC repeat expansion in <em>ZFHX3</em> to SCA4: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01719-5">one</a> group from the University of Utah (where the index family was first documented in 1994, the linkage to 16q22.1 was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8755926/">mapped</a> in 1996, and the ataxia was officially labelled as type 4), two groups from Sweden (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035881/">one</a> from the Lund University and the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.03.23296230v1">other</a> from Karolinska Institute) where the pathogenic mutation was believed to be born in some family in Southern Sweden, possibly in the early 19th century.
