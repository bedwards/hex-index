Then twenty-six, Martin lived in the nearby town of Baie-Saint-Anne, where she worked for her family’s fish- and lobster-buying company. She knew everyone in the small Acadian community, and everyone knew her.</p><p>But the man she met that January night was originally from Montreal and visiting from Moncton, where he went to university and played for a senior hockey league team. He was in town for a game. She found him good looking and noted that he was younger than her. The two began dating, and for the first few months, “things were really good.

So, after three months of living together, she ended things.</p><p>At first, her ex seemed to take the breakup well. He packed most of his belongings and returned to Montreal. But a couple of months later, he was back in New Brunswick. “I found out because he started writing love letters and calling every day, telling me he wanted me back,” says Martin. Though she never responded to his letters, and even though when he called, she made sure to explain firmly that she was not interested, he didn’t stop contacting her.</p><p>Martin didn’t alert the authorities at any point. This is something she’s been questioned on often over the years: Why didn’t she report her ex’s behaviour? “I didn’t realize that </p>...</source>
