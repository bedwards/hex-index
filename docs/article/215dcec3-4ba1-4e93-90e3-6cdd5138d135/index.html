        <h3>“The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.”</h3>
<hr>
<p><em>“In the wholeheartedness of concentration,”</em> the poet Jane Hirshfield wrote in her beautiful inquiry into <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/07/21/jane-hirshfield-concentration/">the effortless effort of creativity</a>, <em>“world and self begin to cohere. With that state comes an enlarging: of what may be known, what may be felt, what may be done.”</em> But concentration is indeed a difficult art, art’s art, and its difficulty lies in the constant conciliation of the dissonance between self and world — a difficulty hardly singular to the particular conditions of our time. Two hundred years before social media, the great French artist Eugène Delacroix lamented <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/17/delacroix-journal-solitude/">the necessary torment of avoiding social distractions in creative work</a>; a century and a half later, Agnes Martin admonished aspiring artists <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/02/23/agnes-martin-inspiration/">to exercise discernment in the interruptions they allow</a>, or else corrupt the mental, emotional, and spiritual privacy where inspiration arises. </p>
<p>But just as <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/23/against-self-criticism-adam-phillips-unforbidden-pleasures/">self-criticism is the most merciless kind of criticism</a> and <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/09/05/school-of-life-self-compassion/">self-compassion the most elusive kind of compassion</a>, self-distraction is the most hazardous kind of distraction, and the most difficult to protect creative work against.</p>
<p>How to hedge against that hazard is what beloved poet <strong>Mary Oliver</strong> (September 10, 1935–January 17, 2019) explores in a wonderful piece titled “Of Power and Time,” found in the altogether enchanting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upstream-Selected-Essays-Mary-Oliver/dp/1594206708/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Upstream: Selected Essays</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/upstream-selected-essays/oclc/942707489&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>

<p>Oliver writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a silver morning like any other. I am at my desk. Then the phone rings, or someone raps at the door. I am deep in the machinery of my wits. Reluctantly I rise, I answer the phone or I open the door. And the thought which I had in hand, or almost in hand, is gone. Creative work needs solitude. It needs concentration, without interruptions. It needs the whole sky to fly in, and no eye watching until it comes to that certainty which it aspires to, but does not necessarily have at once. Privacy, then. A place apart — to pace, to chew pencils, to scribble and erase and scribble again.</p>
<p>But just as often, if not more often, the interruption comes not from another but from the self itself, or some other self within the self, that whistles and pounds upon the door panels and tosses </p>...</blockquote>
