In 1503, on his fourth voyage to the Americas, Columbus became marooned on Jamaica after months of storms and woodworm had all but destroyed his ships. For an entire year, he survived that island, despite a mutinous crew and growing hostility from the native Taínos, who he claimed “ate men” (whether they were truly cannibals or not remains disputed). Such was Columbus’ unpopularity by this stage of his career that his fellow conquistadors on the nearby island of Hispaniola, upon hearing of the Genoese’s predicament, dallied for 12 months before sending a rescue party. Stricken with agonising gout and barely able to walk, Columbus survived two rebellions among his men and managed to thwart the Taíno attempt to starve him out. The locals did not make him king, but they came to believe him a servant of divine wrath after he used a lunar eclipse to terrify them into submission.</p><p>Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, and the ensuing explosion of interest and investment in artificial intelligence, much has been made of the man who has become the face of this emerging technology. But, as <a href="https://open.substack.com/users/91075008-alberto-romero?utm_source=mentions">Alberto Romero</a> has written, you cannot hope to understand Sam Altman, or any of the other AI builders, with an ordinary theory of mind.
