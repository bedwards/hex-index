        <p>The USA’s kidnapping of the President of Venezuela and his wife is a gross breach of international law and the United Nations charter. It presents three dilemmas to the world - not just the public authorities and diplomats of the world, but all of its citizens. </p><p>The standard we walk by is the standard we accept. The USA’s action cannot stand. The UN cannot stay the same. But how to change institutions amid an international crisis?  </p><p><strong>That question poses three dilemmas</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How to negotiate a peaceful resolution of the hostage situation?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How can the UN constrain, punish and rehabilitate the kidnapper, the USA?</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How can the UN be reconstituted on sound principles so this never happens again?</strong></p></li></ul><p>I have a proposal to resolve the Venezuela Crisis, informed by the US Security Council discussion on 5 January, and then to reconstitute the United Nations?

In this context, any Latin American country seeking sovereign policies is viewed through the lens of threat perception.</p><p>As the situation develops, we must hold on to our dignity and clarity. In the words of Mexican philosopher Fernando Buen Abad:</p><p>“<em>Today, we are all anti-imperialists. May our cry for peace shake the deepest roots of anti-colonial dignity in our peoples. Enough of imperial plundering and slavery. WE ARE NO ONE’S COLONY.</em>”</p></blockquote><h2><strong>The First Dilemma: How to Negotiate a Peaceful Resolution of the Hostage Situation</strong></h2><p>The peoples of Latin America, and the world, face a dilemma common to every kidnap or hostage situation. Do you give into the ransom demands? How do you prevent the kidnappers killing the hostages? How do you negotiate with the outlaw to secure the safe release of the hostages? How do you capture the kidnappers and ensure they face justice?</p><p>In the USA, this situation might be resolved by shooting first and avoiding questions later.
