        <p><em>Welcome to the </em>Convivial Society<em>, a newsletter about technology, culture, and the moral life. The newsletter takes its name from the work of the late 20th-century social critic, Ivan Illich. He features prominently in my writing, and in this essay I’m revisiting a talk he gave in the late 1960s and reapplying it to the current drive to deploy AI for good. I trust the provocation will be useful, especially to those among you who might professionally identify with this imperative. In truth, I think there’s something in this for all of us, regardless of whether we work in tech or not.

He is best known for a series of books that came out during the 1970s, which offered radical critiques of industrial age technologies and institutions: <em>Deschooling Society</em>, <em>Tools for Conviviality</em>, <em>Energy and Equity</em>, and <em>Limits of Medicine</em>. </p><p>For the purposes of what follows, all you need to know is that Illich was already known for his trenchant criticism of western-led development projects in Latin America. The UN had declared the 1960s the first Development Decade. It was also the decade the Peace Corps was launched.
