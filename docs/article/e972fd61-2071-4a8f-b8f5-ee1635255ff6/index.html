In both magical practice and creative practice, one becomes a bridge between the realms of the immaterial/invisible and the material/visible. In both you are conjuring force into form, and collaborating with something beyond the small self. In both, you are trafficking in the art of transformation. You are infusing your actions with energy, enchantment, and an intention to be a conduit for a current that can change others -- and change you. Both are a liminal activity wherein you are integrating Surrender/Receptivity with Agency/Craft.
