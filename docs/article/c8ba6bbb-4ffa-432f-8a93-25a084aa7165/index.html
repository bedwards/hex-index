        <p>Last week, Sydney Sweeney broke her silence in an <a href="https://people.com/sydney-sweeney-shares-emotional-response-to-american-eagle-jeans-campaign-exclusive-11863206">exclusive interview</a> with <em>People</em> magazine. After months of deflection, declining engagement, and watching four consecutive films tank, the actress finally addressed the controversy surrounding her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK8s3iqL99c">American Eagle “Great Jeans” campaign</a>. “I was honestly surprised by the reaction,” Sweeney told the outlet. “I don’t support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign.

And if you’re wondering whether this means cancel culture is officially back, the answer is yes. </p><p>And here’s why that’s a good thing.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><em>I’m fighting to document how corporate messaging and celebrity silence normalize dangerous rhetoric before it gets dismissed as “woke overreach”, and I need your help. </em></p><p><em>With no corporate backing or wealthy sponsors, this work depends entirely on readers like you. </em></p><p><em>If everyone reading this became a paid subscriber, I could investigate these cultural flashpoints full-time, but right now less than 4% of my followers are paid subscribers. </em></p><p><em>If you believe in journalism that connects the dots between a jeans ad and a century of eugenics when others look away, please consider a paid subscription today.</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>The Art of Saying Nothing</h2><p>Let’s be clear about what Sweeney actually said, and more importantly, what she didn’t. At no point in her <em>People</em> interview did she denounce white supremacy. She never acknowledged that Donald Trump praised her campaign. She didn’t address the fact that right-wing commentators weaponized her image as proof that “anti-woke” marketing sells. Instead, she offered the kind of statement a crisis PR team drafts at 2 a.m.</p><p>“Anyone who knows me knows that I’m always trying to bring people together. I’m against hate and divisiveness,” Sweeney said—a lovely sentiment that means absolutely nothing when the President of the United States has publicly endorsed your advertising campaign as a victory against diversity initiatives.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg" width="492" height="286.84410646387835" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:460,&quot;width&quot;:789,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:492,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Sydney Sweeney Highlights the Wokesters' Fatal Flaw | National Review&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Sydney Sweeney Highlights the Wokesters' Fatal Flaw | National Review" title="Sydney Sweeney Highlights the Wokesters' Fatal Flaw | National Review" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sOax!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0195f30-c568-4b47-b26b-19581ec63b56_789x460.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sweeney during GQ interview</figcaption></figure></div><p>This wasn’t Sweeney’s first opportunity to clarify her position.
