      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Under the pen name of Mary Cadwalladr I often write about music from the 1950s and ‘60s, when I was not yet even a Necco wafer in my father’s glove compartment. I assume, when I write in this vein, that I am saying many things that must cause older people, with actual historical experience, to roll their eyes (though one of my greatest accomplishments last year was to have turned Greil Marcus on to <a href="https://www.the-hinternet.com/p/she-makes-me-nervous">the raw genius of Brenda Lee</a>). I in turn roll my eyes at the things many younger people write about the music of the 1980s and ‘90s — but not when it’s <em>Hinternet</em> Associate Editor Sam Jennings doing the writing. We disagree on some substantial points concerning what the music of that period can “really” tell us about culture and history, and of all the artists he treats below Cat Power is the only one I’ve ever cared much about (ok, Janet Jackson too, I suppose, who was my first truly intense crush in her turn as Willis’s girlfriend on <em>Diff’rent Strokes</em>). But this is all <em>productive</em> disagreement, and never the sort to induce eye-rolling. Sam and I agree, fundamentally, that music criticism must not be merely an ornament of intellectual and material history, but is rather the clavis for understanding all of it — who we are and how we ended up here. Sam has promised eventually to supplement this masterful <em>survol</em> of the 1990s in music with a treatment of Tag Team’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6mNa_QZVHg">Whoomp! (There It Is)</a>” (1993), for which we are all of course very eager. So play it all, again, Sam. <strong>—</strong><em><strong>JSR</strong></em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png" width="628" height="615.7517730496454" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1106,&quot;width&quot;:1128,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:628,&quot;bytes&quot;:2461049,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.the-hinternet.com/i/183662102?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LfBn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55dc1be7-3418-47b8-98a4-3f15c9e0c574_1128x1106.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Cat Power, <em>Moon Pix</em> (1998)</figcaption></figure></div><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><blockquote><p>“Ahhhhh, the 1990s. The last of the great decades.” —Comment on a Gin Blossoms video, YouTube, 2 months ago</p></blockquote><p>This will be the first in a series of  on what I’m calling “The Metaphysics of Music.” Though in the course of these occasional pieces—covering certain eras and genres, even particular musicians—I’ll be playing pretty fast and loose with the term. In the most general sense, I’ll be dealing with <em>meaning</em>—and meaning is a tricky thing in music. By saying this, I don’t intend to dwell on the “content” or the “text” of the music in question, rather on what you could call the “signified.” My preoccupations will be its internal logic (form), and its external context (history/style/genre).
