Understanding Novorossiysk&#039;s history as Russia&#039;s primary warm-water commercial port, its strategic importance since the 19th century, and its role in oil exports provides essential context for why targeting it impacts Russian energy revenue.</p>

        <p>Hi All,</p><p>I am going to start this update with a short editorial. The last week has been a terrible one, rightly, for the vision of the Ukrainian government in Europe and North America. <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/rage-panic-and-a-glimmer-of-hope-in-ukraine-as-corruption-scandal-unfolds/">The corruption scandal that broke out involving people very close to the Ukrainian president</a> cannot and should not be overlooked or shunted aside. It was and is terrible, points to the existence of real problems at the heart of the state, and rumors are circulating that it might even get worse. As I wrote two days, drastic action needs to be taken now to respond to this crisis and restore confidence in the Ukrainian government. </p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;079dc698-519c-4bac-ae92-c39bb5798e02&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Hi All,Phillips’s Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

Ukrainians have been fighting and dying for their freedom, for their very lives, for 11 years now. They have suffered hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded, are now experiencing daily power cuts, cold days and nights, attacks on their homes and places of work—all the while being faced by an enemy that denies their very right to existence and regularly threatens them with extinction. This is an enemy that just two days ago, continued its campaign to destroy Ukraine’s ability to supply its population with life saving pharmaceuticals (more on that below).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png" width="1456" height="963" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:963,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Russian Drone Attack Wipes Out Another Ukrainian Medicine Warehouse&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Russian Drone Attack Wipes Out Another Ukrainian Medicine Warehouse" title="Russian Drone Attack Wipes Out Another Ukrainian Medicine Warehouse" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xR4A!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe16d8e15-66bb-4be8-bfec-b9e1ed9e6de2_2138x1414.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://united24media.com/latest-news/russian-drone-attack-wipes-out-another-ukrainian-medicine-warehouse-13463">A Ukrainian Pharmaceutical Warehouse Destroyed By Russia on 14 November.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Ukrainians are making this sacrifice every day to give Europe the vital time it still needs to prepare itself for a future, a future it was woefully unready to face. Arguably, they are fighting to see if the idea of Europe that has come into being after World War II has any chance of surviving. While much of the rest of the world retreats from democracy and flirts with, even embraces, the gooeyness of authoritarianism, the Ukrainians are doing the opposite. They are fighting for their lives, and fighting for democracy. </p><p>They would do this whether Zelensky was their president or otherwise. So, when you hear the voices start exclaiming, as they are now, that Ukraine should have no more help, that it needs to be cut off and left to its own devices, remember this.
