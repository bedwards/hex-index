        <p>Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, has been traveling the world to participate in high-stakes foreign policy negotiations on behalf of the president. On Tuesday, Kushner traveled to Moscow and sat across the table from Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. The entire United States delegation consisted only of Kushner and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Kushner and Witkoff were joined at the table by an interpreter.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png" width="1456" height="898" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:898,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lEey!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd5c0942-6a0a-45cc-bf98-64953346c055_1880x1160.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Russian President Vladimir Putin begins a meeting with special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow on December 2, 2025.

Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202">the law</a>, an SGE is someone “who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform, with or without compensation, for not to exceed one hundred and thirty days during any period of three hundred and sixty-five consecutive days, temporary duties either on a full-time or intermittent basis.”</p><p>Trump has not named Kushner an SGE. But a seminal <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/147856-0/dl">1977 opinion</a> by the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) found “an identifiable act of appointment may not be absolutely essential for an individual to be regarded as an officer or employee in a particular case where the parties omitted it for the purpose of avoiding the application of the conflict-of-interest laws.” In that opinion, the OLC considered the status of an individual who had not been named to any role by the president but “assumed considerable responsibility for coordinating the Administration’s activities in [a] particular area.” The OLC concluded that since the individual was “quite clearly engaging in a governmental function” and is “working under the direction or supervision of the President,” he should be considered an SGE.</p><p>Here, Kushner is engaged in activities that can <em>only</em> be conducted by government officials. The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/olc/media/1385381/dl?inline">Logan Act</a> bars private citizens from engaging in negotiations with foreign governments without authorization. Kushner is acting in an authorized capacity, under Trump’s direction, and that creates a host of legal issues.</p><p>As a de facto SGE with substantial authority, the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S9-C8-3/ALDE_00013206/">Foreign Emoluments Clause</a> of the Constitution prohibits Kushner from accepting “any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any </p>...</source>
