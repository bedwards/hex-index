Underneath. A precious bracelet, fashioned out of a crumbling paper straw wrapper, has fallen off a tiny wrist. I’m crouched unsteadily with a pregnant belly, feeling around for it on the carpet as I try to manage the crisis. Small, butter-soaked fingers grab at my hair from the highchair above.</p><p>We’ve found ourselves at an upscale restaurant in downtown <a href="https://technosapiens.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-better-conversations?utm_source=publication-search#footnote-anchor-6-163887825">Washington, DC</a>, halfway through a multi-course, seated dinner.

MUCH! TALKING! </em>He yells.</p><p>I glance down at our bag, discarded toys and books spilling out over the floor, and that’s when I see them: children’s headphones.</p><p><em>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</em>, I realize, is a mere click away on my phone.</p><p>Now, I have a decision to make. Is it time to bring out the big guns? A hundred research studies flash through my mind.
