        <p>Venture capitalists look for various things when evaluating start-ups but every VC is ultimately looking for businesses that are scalable and can develop defensible moats. The irony is that VC funds themselves are typically unscalable and often differentiated by nothing more than their brand. The barrier to scaling for most VCs is the Partner’s bandwidth. VCs often take a board seat and 10%-30% ownership in a company each round. Since they can only sit on about 10-12 board seats at a time and board seats are a multi-year commitment, the capacity to take on another board seat is only available once in a while.</p><p>This model has made it particularly difficult for VC firms to expand geographically. Most investors would rather save their limited capacity to sit on boards for companies in geographies they are more familiar with and where they don't have to travel internationally for board meetings.</p><p>However, the internet is in <a href="https://derin.substack.com/p/ud-00-age-of-deployment">the deployment age</a> and every sector in every country is going to be transformed by the internet. VCs looking to back the best companies will have to go global.

An additional 30 others, went on to start their own funds without raising seed capital from Julian.</p><p>One of those funds was Tiger Global, which was launched by Chase Coleman as a long-short global public equities fund. In 2006, Chase would bring onboard Lee Fixel, who had been investing in China, to lead its business in India alongside Mohan Lakhamraju. Tiger Global made a handful of later-stage investments into early successful Indian internet businesses like MakeMyTrip and Just Dial.</p><p>Mohan Lakhamraju left Tiger Global in 2009 and the firm decided to close its India office. Without a local operation in India, its strategy had to change - and it started to ...</p>
