        <p>Compute is the lifeblood of AI. He who controls <s>the spice controls the universe</s> the compute will control the production of tokens and reap the benefits of AI. Without compute you do not have a seat at the table. The United States technology community is all in on compute and AI as the next platform and is now adding compute at a staggering pace.</p><p>There is competition, and it not only comes from companies but from <em>countries</em>, and the US government has placed a series of export controls to limit China’s rising compute. Today the US controls and is the undisputed leader in compute <a href="https://semianalysis.com/accelerator-model/">with more than 70% of the worlds deployed FLOPs</a>. One way to stay ahead is to keep going full steam while hindering your competition. Limiting your competitor nation state from compute, which will limit them from intelligence, is the current policy to stay ahead in the AI race.</p><p>These moves have led to backlash, including with China cutting rare earth minerals and magnets off from the US. Secretary of Commerce <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-resume-h20-gpu-sales-china-2025-07-15/">Howard Lutnick says</a> the resumption of Nvidia GPU sales to China were required to restart China's shipments of their linchpin supply chain materials.</p><p>But constraints have also led to adaptation, and Chinese companies have adapted. High batch sizes and disaggregated serving are but two examples. Despite advances, in the case of DeepSeek, most of their tokens are still inferenced on western hardware. We wrote about this dynamic in our recent DeepSeek debrief. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb984646-6320-4bfe-a78d-a1da2274b092">Training of DeepSeek's next generation model was also delayed by the use of Huawei chips</a>, as we also said in the debrief.</p><p>This is not a stable equilibrium. There are always moving pieces in the race for intelligence. Beijing plans for the long term and knows it must secure its own domestic compute destiny. There is an irony: in the 2010s China kicked out Google to enforce its Great Firewall and foster its domestic industry, this time the US government is withholding hardware technology so they cannot seize the lead in AI.</p><p><strong>We believe that at China’s core, they want to control not only its internet and AI, but the hardware that supports it. </strong>From silicon to tokens, China seeks sovereignty over every layer of the stack, and given recent history will never want to be beholden to foreign powers. Enter Huawei.</p><p>China loves national champions, and in it’s characteristic capitalism, ...</p>
