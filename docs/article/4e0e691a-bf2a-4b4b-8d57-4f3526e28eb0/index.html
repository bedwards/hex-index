Over $600 billion as of this writing, bigger than Visa and just behind TSMC. </p><p>It is a bit crazy considering that in 2009 the whole company was worth $4 billion. 150 times growth in 15 years is kind of wild. </p><p>But what is Broadcom? How did they get this big? What do they do? In this video, how a little chip division grew to be a $600 billion AI juggernaut. </p><h2>Beginnings </h2><p>The company now known as Broadcom started as a spinoff of a spinoff. </p><p>In March 1999, the iconic California-based computer-maker Hewlett-Packard decided to split into two. </p><p>Everything unrelated to computers, IT or printers would be put into the new company - Agilent Technologies. </p><p>The new publicly-traded company covered HP's former test and measurement, medical products, chemical analysis, and semiconductor businesses. Accounting for about $8 billion of HP's $47 billion total revenues. </p><p>Analysts saw this as a necessary re-focusing of a business that had grown too large. In an interview at the time, Agilent's new CEO Ned Barnholt positioned it as a coming-out of sorts from the shadows. </p><p>Agilent's debut on the markets was one of the biggest IPOs in history up until then. The stock popped nearly 70%. </p><p>But the new company struggled to grow in the rough years after the bursting of the Dotcom and fiber optic bubbles. The company's revenues shrank nearly 50% from 2000 to 2001. </p><p>And soon they started laying people off and selling entire divisions to raise money and simplify the business. So in June 2005, they put up their chip division - called the Semiconductor Products Group - up for sale. </p><h2>Spinning Off the Chips </h2><p>There followed a brief auction... Which PE firms KKR and Silver Lake Partners won for $2.65 billion in August 2005. </p><p>The government of Singapore also co-invested in the deal through their Temasek and GIC sovereign wealth funds. Singapore had been a partner with Hewlett-Packard since 1970, when HP first chose to set up a factory there. </p><p>It was a glorious time to be in private equity. Some of the biggest private equity deals in history were closed during this 2006-2007 period before the Global Financial Crisis. </p><p>Big ...</p>
