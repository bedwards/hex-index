        <p>The Alger Hiss-Whittaker Chambers saga, not so widely known today, was high drama. Actually that understates matters. It was drama of the highest order. You couldn’t make it up. </p><p>It should be a movie. It almost has to be a movie.</p><p>(After the fact, the novelist Allen Drury tried, more or less, to make it up, about a decade after the relevant events. See his gripping novel, Advise and Consent, and the amazing Henry Fonda movie that was based on it. Inspired by Hiss and Chambers, Drury couldn’t match the real thing. Not close.)</p><p>The Hiss-Chambers saga is not only an enduringly fascinating drama, with unforgettable protagonists (and their unforgettable wives), a host of other unforgettable figures (including a president-to-be), and unanswered questions that persist to this day. (One word in that sentence will be taken, by some, to be fighting words. Do you know what it is? Right: “unanswered.”) There are plenty of mysteries here. </p><p>The drama set the stage for, and helps explain, a lot of what we are seeing today. It says more than a lot about the current right, and it says something, too, about the current left.</p><p>To get ahead of the tale: Hiss stood for the elite. He was seen, by a lot of the country, as a domestic enemy. He was seen, by a lot of the country, as disloyal. He was seen, by a lot of the country, as Harvard, and that was seen, by a lot of the country, as very bad. </p><p>But I am indeed getting ahead of the tale.  </p><p>1</p><p>Alger Hiss was handsome, eloquent, and charming. He was tall and thin. He was boyish. He was winning, with a shy smile. He was smart as a whip. If there was ever a golden boy, it was Alger Hiss. Here he is:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png" width="554" height="778" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:778,&quot;width&quot;:554,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:516671,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://casssunstein.substack.com/i/182337223?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nwJW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fcdf82a-dc56-4ebf-b5b0-a16c46e171c1_554x778.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>(Reader, I knew him.
