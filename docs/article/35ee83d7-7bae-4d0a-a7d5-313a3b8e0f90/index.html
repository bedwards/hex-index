        <p>Happy Monday, and welcome to the tenth edition of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on McLennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. After a great week in Vegas, my wife and I are home and excited to get back into our normal routine. </p><p>I am including a new section in Waco Can’t Wait where I will cite neat articles and white papers related to political organizing and messaging. One of my goals for this newsletter is to provide resources for current and future organizers, activists, and candidates. It is important that we disseminate this information so we can continue to grow in strength. This new addition to the newsletter was inspired by a suggestion from my <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSesB-noEj4dNgK_Fu9m6BcK1oU4xeYjkUwEKseX6nmJ6du10g/viewform?usp=sf_link">Readers Survey</a>, which is still open if anyone would like to make any comments!</p><p>Also, if you would prefer to receive my newsletter in an app (rather than your email inbox), <a href="https://substack.com/app">Substack has launched a new app for iPhones</a> (and Androids in the future). </p><p>Now that all of the results are finalized from the March Democratic Primary, we can look forward to the May 24th Primary Runoff for candidates that did not meet the 50% threshold.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> I’ll be taking a quick look at the unresolved races and providing a little more context on the remaining candidates. But first, let’s take a look at the news!</p><h4>Week in review (a collection of news from Waco, Texas, and beyond)</h4><p><em><strong>Waco:</strong></em></p><p>After filing closed on Monday, <strong><a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/managing-wacos-growth-key-issue-in-district-2-city-council-special-election/article_b51f1090-9f2f-11ec-a34f-6b53c25ec435.html">the Special Election for Waco City Council District 2 will be contested by Tiffany Vidaña, Armando Arvizu, and Alice Rodriguez.</a></strong> While all candidates share an interest in improving communication between the city while also ensuring equitable development, I believe it is time for a new, younger voice on city council.
