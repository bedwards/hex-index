Edwards’ declaration was made at the now-infamous “Epstein Survivors” <a href="https://www.mtracey.net/p/these-professional-epstein-survivors">press conference</a> in front of the US Capitol on September 3, 2025. And funnily enough, Edwards was addressing his comments to me — <em>in absentia</em> anyway — because by that time I had already been thrown out of the press conference. As you might recall, my ejection-worthy offense was asking Edwards a question about Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who was repeatedly hailed throughout the day as a martyr for truth and justice, because she had given her life to expose the ravages of Epstein’s monumental pedo-trafficking operation.</p><p>My question to Edwards was a straightforward one, but the assembled media and politicians clearly found it appalling. Given that Virginia Roberts Giuffre <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/us/alan-dershowitz-virginia-giuffre-allegations-dropped">admitted</a>, in 2022, that she had spent nearly a decade falsely accusing a prominent individual of graphic sex crimes, why should she now be seen by the public as <em>remotely</em> credible? And moreover, why should <em>Edwards</em> be seen as remotely credible, in his capacity as a political and legal advocate making demands on behalf of purported “Survivors”? I didn’t actually ask that second question, although I would have liked to. The first question was enough to get me booted by Capitol Police, after Marjorie Taylor Greene and a mob of “Survivors” riled themselves into a vindictive frenzy. But really: Edwards was representing Virginia Roberts Giuffre (henceforth referred to as the notorious “VRG”) at the time she made these sensational claims against Alan Dershowitz, and representing her when she recanted them. So what credibility do <em>either</em> of them have?</p><p>I almost want to bracket the whole Dershowitz ordeal, because I’m well aware that people are chronically incapable of separating out whatever feelings they might have about Dershowitz on wholly unrelated issues. So please, let it be known that the chronic fabrications and serial unreliability of Virginia Roberts Giuffre can be more than amply established even if one were to simply forget the whole Dershowitz thing ever happened. Even though it would be an absurd thing to arbitrarily forget: VRG described in the most lurid detail, under multiple depositions, the nature of the sex acts to </p>...</source>
