Using genomic and clinical data from BioVU, All of Us, and the UK Biobank, the researchers found that CHIP carriers faced a 20% higher risk of stroke overall, with the strongest effects seen for <em>JAK2</em>(2.5× risk) and <em>TET2</em> (1.4× risk) mutations. Strikingly, the association was present only in postmenopausal women, hinting that estrogen may buffer CHIP-related inflammation. The study also uncovered a gene–inflammation link: elevated genetically predicted levels of IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) amplified stroke risk among CHIP carriers, nominating IL-1 signaling as a potential therapeutic target. Together, the findings position CHIP as a major, actionable determinant of cerebrovascular disease, bridging somatic genetics, inflammation, and stroke prevention. <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.22.25338594v1.full.pdf">Read More</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Can everyday clinical data reveal biological age across the lifespan?</strong><br>This study introduces a “full life cycle biological clock” trained on over 1.1 billion routine clinical measurements spanning all age groups to estimate biological age and health trajectories from birth to old age. Using machine learning, the model integrates common lab tests and vital signs to derive an individualised biological age gap that predicts mortality, multimorbidity, and functional decline better than chronological age. The authors show that accelerated biological ageing signatures emerge decades before disease onset and differ by organ system and lifestyle factors such as smoking or BMI. Importantly, the clock generalises across populations and clinical settings, enabling large-scale, low-cost ageing assessment using existing medical records. This framework reframes biological ageing as a continuously measurable, clinically actionable phenotype, with potential for preventive health </p></li>...</ul>
