Opposing the legislation: Police, Firearm Instructors, Moms Demand Action, most Democrats. On the fence: Lt. Governor Dan Patrick and Governor Greg Abbott.</p><p><strong>Rewind:</strong> Representative Matt Schaefer (R) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Caucus">Freedom Caucus</a> (think Tea Party, but extra) are getting the big W on this one since they have been pushing for loosening gun laws for years. Many politicians and insiders assumed they wouldn’t even get this bill out of committee (as many attempts were denied in the past), but here we are. Undoubtedly, Dade Phelan’s role as Speaker helped since he previously worked on similar open-carry plans when he was a Representative years ago.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The support:</strong> Matt Schaefer (whose bill pass rating is 3.3% over 8 years) has essentially argued that many people don't have the time or the money to get a permit, a process akin to getting a driver's license or registering to vote. By removing this burden, people can better exercise their "God-given" right to self-defense and constitutional right to bear arms. Dade Phelan agrees with him, having previously stated that it’s “not a big deal” and that “<a href="https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Bill-would-let-unlicensed-Texans-carry-handguns-13812386.php">law abiding citizens are just fine carrying a firearm</a>.”</p><p><strong>The opposition: </strong>Many GOP members have campaigned on their support for the “back the blue” pledge and their antagonism against “defunding the police” measures, yet they are awkwardly opposing about <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2015/02/13/75-percent-of-texas-police-chiefs-responding-to-survey-oppose-open-carry/">75% of chiefs</a> on this matter. Dallas Police Chief Eddie Garcia claims “the licensing process is the best way to ensure” that gun safety is understood, and that the bill would ultimately make police officers "less safe." Given the recent mass-shooting with a handgun in Bryan, Texas, that critically injured a State Trooper when his cruiser was shot 13 times, the Chief’s point is particularly cogent.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The </strong></p>...</source>
