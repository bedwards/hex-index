So when Takaichi Sanae became Prime Minister last October, it was because she won an internal party election, not because she received the mandate of the people. This was a problem for her, because her party — the Liberal Democratic Party (also known as Jiminto or the LDP), which is usually in power in Japan — didn’t actually have that strong of a majority. When their long-time coalition partner, a smaller party called Komeito, <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/japans-26-year-old-ruling-coalition-collapses">ditched the LDP</a> after Takaichi came to power, some people thought Takaichi’s tenure in office might be cut short, or hamstrung by a lack of votes. </p><p>So Takaichi did the smart but risky thing, which was to call a nationwide election. That election took place yesterday. The LDP proceeded to stomp all over the opposition, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/08/asia/japan-takaichi-snap-election-exit-polls-intl">winning in a massive landslide</a>. Takaichi’s party <a href="https://x.com/cmcclean/status/2020588035914481945">won 68%</a> of the seats in the lower house, giving the LDP a 2/3 majority all by itself. That’s the biggest majority the LDP has ever had in its 71 years of existence — and when you add in its new coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, it’s now <em>76%</em>. That means Takaichi can easily push through essentially any legislation she wants, except for a constitutional amendment (and those aren’t off the table either).<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> The Takaichi Era has now begun for real. </p><p>Americans have taken a bit more of an interest in Japanese politics and society lately, probably because of the tourism boom. So I thought I’d try to explain what this all means. </p><p>First, there’s the question of why the LDP always seems to win in Japan. Except for two brief periods out of power — in 1993 and 2009-2012 — the LDP has ruled Japan for the entire time since it came into existence in 1955. This almost unbroken run of victories has some people wondering if Japan is some kind of fake democracy or one-party state. </p><p>It’s not. The best book about this that I’ve ever found is Ethan Scheiner’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Democracy-without-Competition-Japan-Opposition/dp/0521609690">Democracy without Competition in Japan: Opposition Failure in a One-Party Dominant State</a></em>. According to Scheiner, there are basically two reasons why the LDP stays on top. The first is that until the mid-2000s, there were some structural quirks </p>...</source>
