I remember I’d feel resentful and actually wonder why God (if you believe in him) didn’t make me the right kind of half-Asian. I didn’t want to look like my mother, I wanted to look more like my dad. I wanted to be half-White and half-Asian but the pretty kind. The sought after ‘mestiza’, with a light-skinned complexion, light eyes, straight hair, tall and probably freckled. Really simply, I wanted to be white passing with <em>just a dash</em> of Asian-ness, enough for people to look at me and think I was distinctive and unique.&nbsp;</p><p>For the majority of my life, I’ve been jealous of my brothers’ European features. My older brother has a straight nose, my little brother has rosy cheeks and fair skin. My complexion and my features have always been something I’ve been so sensitive about.&nbsp;</p><p>How could it not be?</p><p>I was always told that my older brother had the family nose, that he looked like a Stockinger.

The media has always stood firmly at the frontline, delivering and cementing these idealised standards. In her book, Constructing the Filipina: A History of Women’s Magazines 1891-2002, Georgina Encanto maps the obvious preference for mestizas through magazines - these women are portrayed as </p>...</source>
