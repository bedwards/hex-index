          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses U.S. drone operations in Pakistan&#039;s Waziristan region, including specific strikes documented by Amnesty International. This Wikipedia article provides comprehensive historical context on the scope, legality debates, and civilian casualty counts that directly inform the &#039;double tap&#039; controversy discussed.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Hellfire missiles as the specific weapon used to kill Mamani Bibi. Understanding the technical capabilities, blast radius, and deployment of this precision-guided munition provides important context for evaluating claims about targeting precision and civilian casualties in drone warfare.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Taibbi points out the irony of Panetta accusing the Trump administration of war crimes while he was Secretary of Defense during the Pakistan &#039;double tap&#039; strikes. Understanding Panetta&#039;s full career—CIA Director overseeing drone expansion, then Defense Secretary—provides crucial context for evaluating his current criticism.</p>

The <em>Times </em>report elicited a bizarre non-denial denial from Barack Obama’s White House, in which an unnamed spokesman said we should “wonder” about “misinformation” coming from “elements who would like nothing more than to malign these efforts and help Al Qaeda succeed.”</p><p>Because the U.S. and its allies were releasing so little information about these strikes, Amnesty International in 2013 sent a researcher named Mustafa Qadri to Pakistan to try to collect information about them. Currently the CEO and founder of a human rights organization called <a href="https://equidem.org/">Equidem</a>, Qadri conducted 60 interviews, mainly at nine strike sites in south Waziristan, Pakistan (the Pakistani government wouldn’t allow entrance into more heavily-bombed northern Waziristan). Qadri ended up compiling a long <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ASA33/013/2013/en/">report</a> that described the U.S. as complicit in a variety of grisly offenses. The first known strike took place in the village of Dhok in 2004, but after January, 2009,  “President Barack Obama markedly expanded the use of drone aircraft for killings.”</p><p>Qadri put named sources to accounts of drone killings. This was rare, because there was significant fear of reprisal by Pakistani authorities at the time. He nonetheless detailed deaths of people like 68-year old Mamani Bibi, who was so accustomed to seeing drones that she continued work outside gathering okra at the sight of one on October 24th, 2012, until she was blown up in front of her grandchildren (who described the “terrible smell” and the site of her empty shoes) by at least two Hellfire missiles. Even more relevant to the present was Qadri’s documentation of a July 6, 2012 attack in the the village of Zowi Sidgi, where at least eight people were killed instantly in a first drone attack.
