        <p>The book has been gearing for its last chapter as one would find in a good novel, when at the end the whole story makes better sense. The case <em>for</em> the First Amendment and thus the case against the establishment of religion in the USA are the heart of Randall Balmer’s <em><strong><a href="https://amzn.to/4mASrxx">America’s Best Idea: The Separation of Church and State</a></strong></em>. His last chapter leads from yesterday’s Substack (about the nativist international policies of the current administration) directly into Christian nationalism (CN).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png" width="776" height="422" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:422,&quot;width&quot;:776,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:568295,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://scotmcknight.substack.com/i/180890873?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WDb-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F443a1d32-205e-470f-aec9-138cf20b49c0_776x422.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“When the Bible comes bundled with the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of Allegiance, as was the case with the <em>God Bless the USA Bible </em>that Donald Trump promoted for $59.99 while a presidential candidate in 2024, you can bet something more is at stake.” My money is on Balmer’s “more.” Balmer punches a nose with “Despite–or perhaps because of–the messenger, the message of Christian nationalism has been amplified in recent years, although this is nothing new in American history.” As Balmer’s tract for our times has already shown. </p><p>Confederates were upset by the absence of God and Christianity in the US Constitution enough that they drew up their own “Christian enterprise.” Lincoln wisely contended that we ought not to be revising the Constitution “hastily.”</p><p>Instead of CN proposing a new Constitution, though I’m not persuaded the current administration might not have that in mind, CN folks have two agendas. First, “To subvert the First Amendment, both by legislation and by judicial rulings” and in some states taxpayer funds fund Christian schools (cf. <em>Espinoza v. Montana</em> and <em>Carson v. Makin</em>). Second, “Simply declare that, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, the United States is and always has been a Christian nation.” The influence of David Barton is noticeable in the second strategy. By the way, Warren Throckmorton and Michael Coulter have taken to pieces the shabby, ideological scholarship of David Barton.
