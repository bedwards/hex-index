        <p>I spent much of the 2010s as a Westminster reporter covering the rise and fall of UKIP as a political party. Nigel Farage won the Brexit referendum but on a domestic electoral level his party would frequently talk big about a looming electoral breakthrough, make a splash on social media, then collapse at the polling booth — especially in London.</p><p>UKIP was constantly undone by unforced amateurish errors in the capital. I remember watching as they held a chaotic “diversity carnival” outside the Whitgift Centre in Croydon, where a steel drum band went on strike and stopped playing because they hadn’t been told it was a political event. On another occasion I was with Farage as he bemoaned UKIP’s party name being missed off the London mayoral election ballot paper because someone hadn’t filled out a form correctly.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:414152,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/181131979?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7qbO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4f9ae82b-7e3d-4dfe-ae9a-1214dd521a2b_1500x1000.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">London boroughs where past Reform UK polling performance suggests they could be competitive in May. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This week London Centric obtained internal training documents given to Reform UK candidates ahead of next year’s local elections, where the party will be hoping to take advantage of a fractured left-wing vote to make substantial gains in parts of London. </p><p>Heavily influenced by old-school Liberal Democrat tactics from their time as an insurgent party, the leaked guidance suggests Reform UK will focus on local issues such as bin collections, sets out how the party can appeal to Remain voters and those upset by Conservative cuts to benefits, and urges its local candidates to stay off social media at all costs.

You might be the sort of person who takes out a subscription to Vittles in the hope of being tipped off about the best South Korean in New Malden. You might rely on the fabled 3.5 star filtering system for Chinese restaurants.
