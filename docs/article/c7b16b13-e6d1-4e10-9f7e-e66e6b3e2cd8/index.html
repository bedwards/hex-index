        <p><em>Before we get to today’s post, I wanted to share a quick update on our <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/one-million-dollars">GiveDirectly fundraiser</a>. It should come as no surprise that Slow Boring readers have once again risen to the occasion. Our goal was to raise $1,000,000 in the month of December, and in just three days, we’re almost 90% there. Some stats for you: Slow Boring readers have given $522,015 (the highest by far for any Substack participating in the fundraiser), and of the 1,134 of you who have donated, 506 are new GiveDirectly donors. Your donations have unlocked $212,118 in match funds for a grand total of <strong>$734,133</strong>!</em></p><p><em>This is incredible, and we’re grateful to have such a generous audience. If you haven’t had a chance to donate yet and are so inclined, we’d love to make it all the way to $1,000,000 by the end of the week!</em> </p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg" width="1456" height="1143" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1143,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:13469608,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.slowboring.com/i/180413636?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oQvX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F517fa0f9-b16e-4d3c-b10b-d4ec9b6a8ec9_5528x4338.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Their lifestyle is available to you.

Green’s piece is full of errors, which its fans seem to have largely conceded, but they feel that he’s right on the level of vibes, and I think this bit about dual-earner families is the core of that. </p><p>He writes that between 1963 and 2024 “everything changed” and that today a family needs two incomes to maintain the standard of living that used to be provided by one: </p><blockquote><p>The labor model shifted. A second income became mandatory to maintain the standard of living that one income formerly provided. But a second income meant child care became mandatory, which meant two cars became mandatory. Or maybe you’d simply be “asking for a lot generationally speaking” because living near your parents helps to defray those child care costs.</p></blockquote><p>I think that this is more important than any specific factual claim Green makes about economic data, because it is unquestionably true that this type of household has gone into decline. </p><p>The ideological claim that this decline is bad is a fair topic for debate.
