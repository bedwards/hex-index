        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses peanut allergy treatments involving controlled exposure to peanuts. Oral immunotherapy is the specific medical approach being used in the studies mentioned, and understanding its mechanisms and history would deepen comprehension of both why early exposure prevents allergies and how current treatments work.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s core thesis—that shielding children from peanuts caused more allergies—is a specific application of the broader hygiene hypothesis, which explains how reduced early-life exposure to microbes and allergens may increase allergic disease. This scientific framework contextualizes why the AAP guidance was so catastrophically wrong.</p>

Today, the United States has one of the highest peanut-allergy rates in the world. Disturbingly, this epidemic was precipitated by institutions that exist to <em>promote</em> public health. The story of their malpractice illuminates the fallibility of respected institutions, and confirms that public health’s destructive performance during the Covid-19 pandemic wasn’t an isolated anomaly. </p><div><hr></div><p>The roots of this particular example of expert-inflicted mass suffering can be found in the early 1990s, when the existence of peanut allergies — still a very rare and mostly low-risk phenomenon at the time — first came to public notice. Their entry into public consciousness began with studies published by medical researchers. By the mid-1990s, however, major media outlets were running attention-grabbing stories of hospitalized children and terrified parents. The Great Parental Peanut Panic was on. </p><p>As fear and dread mounted, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a professional association of tens of thousands of US pediatricians, felt compelled to tell parents how to prevent their children from becoming the latest victims. “There was just one problem: They didn’t know what precautions, if any, parents should take,” wrote then-Johns Hopkins surgeon and now-FDA Commissioner Marty Makary in his 2024 book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blind-Spots-Medicine-Wrong-Health/dp/1639735313">Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health</a></em>. </p><p>Ignorance proved no obstacle. Lacking humility and seeking to bolster its reputation as an authoritative organization, the AAP in 2000 handed down definitive instructions:  Parents should avoid feeding any peanut product to children under 3 years old who were believed to have a high risk of developing a peanut allergy; pregnant and lactating mothers were likewise cautioned against consuming peanuts. </p><p>The AAP noted that “the ability to determine which infants are at high risk is imperfect.” Indeed, simply having a relative with <em>any kind</em> of allergy could land a child or mother in the “high risk” category. Believing they were erring on the side of caution, pediatricians across the country started giving blanket instructions that children shouldn’t be fed any peanut food until age 3; pregnant and breastfeeding mothers were told to steer clear too. </p><p>What was the basis of the AAP’s pronouncement? The organization was simply parroting guidance that the UK Department of Health had put forth in 1998. Makary scoured that guidance for a scientific rationale, and found a declaration that mothers who eat peanuts were more likely to have </p>...</source>
