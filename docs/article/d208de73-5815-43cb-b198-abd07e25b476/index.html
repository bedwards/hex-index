This situation raised broader concerns for the Dutch government about the availability of semiconductor products critical to the European industry.</p><p>The combination of Zhang Xuezheng’s behaviour as CEO and (indirect) shareholder, as well as concerns about the semiconductor product availability in the Netherlands and Europe, ultimately led to the Dutch government to intervene with an exceptional emergency order on the basis of the Goods Availability Act (Wbg).</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_Availability_Act">Goods Availability Act</a> was enacted in 1952 for post-WWII reconstruction efforts and allows the Dutch government to control critical goods during national emergencies, and its application to Nexperia was the <em>first time</em> the law was ever used. The Dutch government was prompted to use this historically extreme measure because they believed that the actions of a Chinese entity would undermine their access to critical semiconductor chips. It comes down to two specific reasons: WingSkySemi and US export controls.</p><h4>Investments into WingSkySemi</h4><p>A Dutch court ruling contains specific allegations that ...</p>
