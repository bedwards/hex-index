Too young to fully understand the implications of her admonishment, I hung my head from the weight of my mother’s shame projected onto my lanky little body. All I knew was that she believed that, for Black people, especially poor Black people like us, our survival and dignity hinged on <em>presenting well</em> in public.</p><p>In the summer of 2020, an uprising was ignited by the public execution of George Floyd. Then in my forties, a professional placemaker and adjunct urban planning professor, I had a greater understanding of my mother’s, and other Black elders’, preoccupation with how their children conducted themselves in public. I was acutely aware of public policies that restricted our public expressions and freedoms and had witnessed countless incidents demonstrating our disproportionate risks. Within my lifetime, the penalty for a Black person perceived to be misstepping in public had never been more clear than it was in the final, excruciating nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds of George Floyd’s life.</p><p>The notion that Black people and other groups experiencing disproportionate harm should be able to navigate public spaces without being murdered should be a given. Still, I believe that we should expand our expectations and strive for even more—public joy.</p><p>It is not enough to say that joy is already woven into our classic and contemporary texts. There is a difference between creating real or figurative traumascapes with glimmers of joy and laying down joy as a narrative foundation. When joy becomes the premise, the place upon which we build our realities in literature and life, new possibilities within and beyond our communities arise. There is a wealth of documentation focused on our public degradation; why not bend the narrative arc toward Black public joy?</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>You can’t share stories from </strong><em><strong>thewalrus.ca</strong></em><strong> on Facebook or Instagram because of Meta’s response to the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-you-might-stop-seeing-canadian-news/">Online News Act</a>, but you can share this Substack article there</strong></h4><div><hr></div><p><strong>To understand the</strong> concept of Black public joy, or public joy of any kind, it’s imperative to first begin by defining, or at least exploring, the dimensions of joy itself. </p>...</source>
