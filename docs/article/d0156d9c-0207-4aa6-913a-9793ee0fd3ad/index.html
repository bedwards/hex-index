Understanding deontology&#039;s emphasis on duties and rights-violations versus consequences is essential to following the philosophical argument.</p>

        <p>Moral offsetting is the practice of making up for a bad or prima facie wrongful action by doing something else that is good enough to outweigh the bad act. What should we think about this? </p><p>I don’t have a definite thesis about it, so I’m just going to ramble about how offsetting is puzzling and some things we might say about it.</p><h2>1.

So, for each time you eat meat, you might decide to donate a certain amount of money to <a href="https://veganoutreach.org/">Vegan Outreach</a>, sufficient to reduce animal cruelty by enough to outweigh the harm caused by your meat purchase. Does this make the meat purchase permissible?</p><p>If so, must the donation be to an <em>animal</em> charity? Could one, say, offset meat eating by donating to the Against Malaria Foundation, which has nothing to do with animal welfare but is nevertheless doing a lot of good?</p><p><em>(iii) Murder</em></p><p>Suppose you think that murder is wrong, but you really hate your neighbor. You decide to kill him but then donate a large amount of money to charity, so as to save many more lives than the one that you took. Does this make the murder permissible?</p><h2>2. The Case for Offsetting</h2><p>So here’s an argument. Let B be some bad action, let O be the offsetting action, let N be the “action” of doing <em>neither</em> B nor O, and let “x+y” be the action of doing both x and y. </p><ol><li><p>N is permissible.</p></li><li><p>B+O is better than N. </p></li><li><p>(x)(y) If x is permissible, and y is better than x, then y is permissible.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, B+O is permissible.</p></li></ol><p>This seemingly works for all three cases of offsetting above. </p><p>However, if you’re a deontologist, you might think that (3) is false; you might say that <em>rightness</em> is not so simply determined by facts about what is <em>better and worse</em>.
