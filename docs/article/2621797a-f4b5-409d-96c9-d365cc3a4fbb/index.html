        <h3>“The universe is the ultimate free lunch.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>“Every formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to God,” the trailblazing astronomer and leading <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/11/01/figuring/"><em>Figuring</em></a> figure Maria Mitchell wrote in the second half of the nineteenth century as she contemplated <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/06/05/maria-mitchell-science-religion/">science, spirituality, and the human hunger for truth</a>. Every great scientist in the century and a half since has been faced with this question, be it by personal restlessness or public demand. Einstein addressed it in answering <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/07/11/do-scientists-pray-einstein-letter-science-religion/">a little girl’s question about whether scientists pray</a>. Quantum theory originator Max Planck believed that <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/06/12/max-planck-where-is-science-going/">“science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature [because] we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.”</a> His fellow Nobel laureate and quantum theory founding father Niels Bohr defied the sentiment in his <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/02/01/niels-bohr-science-religion/">incisive distinction between subjective and objective reality</a>, noting that religions have always addressed the former, while science addresses the latter, which is measurable and therefore knowable. Wolfgang Pauli, whose groundbreaking scientific ideas were greatly influenced by Bohr’s, concluded that the effort to reconcile science and religion <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/03/13/wolfgang-pauli-carl-jung-figuring/">“will always be full of pitfalls and one can fall down on both sides.”</a></p>
<p>It takes a mind of rare courage and insight to address this abiding question without falling into the most pernicious trap of all — that of artificial compatibilism; to take a lucid stance without fright of offense, then to explain the basis of that stance thoughtfully and sensitively, systematically dismantling every reflexive argument against it. </p>
<p>That is what <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> (January 8, 1942–March 14, 2018) does in his final book, <a href="amazon.com/Brief-Answers-Questions-Stephen-Hawking/dp/1984819194/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/brief-answers-to-the-big-questions/oclc/1089955462&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — a collection of ten enormous questions Hawking was asked regularly throughout his life, by children and elders, by entrepreneurs and political leaders, by men and women young and old attending his prolific lectures and public appearances, with answers drawn from his extensive personal archive of correspondence, notes, drafts, interviews, and essays. The book — which was conceived during Hawking’s lifetime but finished only after his death with help from his family and academic colleagues, and proceeds from which benefit the <a href="https://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.mndassociation.org/" target="_blank">Motor Neurone Disease Association</a> — opens with the question that has bellowed in humanity’s chest since science first confronted superstition: Is there a God?</p>
