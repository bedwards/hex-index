        <p><em>Welcome back, sapiens!</em></p><p><em>Today’s post is a collaboration with Dr. Cara Goodwin, child psychologist and founder of the nonprofit <a href="https://parentingtranslator.org/">Parenting Translator</a>. You may be familiar with her hugely popular <a href="http://instagram.com/parentingtranslator">Instagram</a> and <a href="http://parentingtranslator.substack.com/">newsletter</a>, particularly if you (like me) love a good piece of research-backed parenting advice. </em></p><p><em>What you may *not*</em> <em>already know is that Cara and I overlapped in the Clinical Psychology PhD program at UNC Chapel Hill—and when I search for Cara’s name in my inbox, there’s a 13-year-old (!) email from her, very kindly offering to pick me up from the airport for my campus visit.  </em></p><p><em>I do not remember this car ride well,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> but I can only assume Cara was as skilled at driving as she is at delivering actionable, digestible, and evidence-based guidance for parents. If you’re not already following her newsletter, I highly recommend subscribing <a href="https://parentingtranslator.substack.com/">here</a>! </em></p><div><hr></div><h6><em>7 min read</em></h6><p>Maybe you’ve noticed: in the past few weeks, the latest round of scary, screen-related headlines has arrived:</p><p><em>“Real Risk to Youth Mental Health Is ‘Addictive Use,’ Not Screen Time Alone, Study Finds”</em> <em>(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/18/health/youth-suicide-risk-phones.html">The New York Times</a>)</em></p><p><em>“Why Parents Should Focus on Screen Addiction Over Screen Time, Says New Study”</em> (<em><a href="https://www.parents.com/screen-time-addiction-linked-to-mental-health-concerns-11760143">Parents</a>)</em></p><p><em>“Screen addiction and suicidal behaviors are linked for teens, a study shows”</em> (<em><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5436951/jama-screens-teens-addiction-suicide-abcd">NPR</a>)</em></p><p>So, what should we make of these findings? Should we get rid of screen time limits? Is “screen addiction” a real diagnosis? And where do we go from here?</p><h2><strong>Tell me about the study</strong></h2><p>For <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2835481?guestAccessKey=1e247dd1-cadf-430c-baad-bc5c5543ad29&amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;utm_term=061825">this new paper</a>, published last month in <em>JAMA</em>, researchers analyzed data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a massive, ongoing study of child health that’s following thousands of kids across the U.S.</p><p>This particular project involved 4,285 tweens<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> who participated at three time points, spanning ages 10 to 14.</p><p>The following measures were collected:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Addictive screen use. </strong>The kids filled out surveys assessing addictive use of three types of screens: phones, social media, and video games.</p></li><li><p><strong>Screen time. </strong>Kids also reported the total number of hours (0-24) they spend per day on screens for non-school activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mental health symptoms. </strong>Parents reported whether kids had symptoms of a range of concerns, like depression, anxiety, and behavior problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Suicidal ideation and behavior. </strong>Both parents and kids were interviewed about whether the child had any suicidal thoughts or attempts over the past few years.</p></li></ul><p>The researchers then ...</p>
