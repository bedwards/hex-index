While readers may have heard of NFTs, a deeper understanding of the technology, market dynamics, and common patterns of speculation would illuminate why these ventures are described as &#039;wealth transfers from believer to icon.&#039;</p>

Controversy grew as the sale also <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/khabibs-4-4m-nft-sale-sparks-feud-as-mcgregor-slams-crypto-scam/">involved </a>Khabib saying it was in honour of his deceased father and coach, Abdulmanap, a devout Muslim who taught his son discipline and principles alongside martial arts.<br><br>Now, Abdulmanap’s legacy was being repackaged as a “digital gift” on Telegram, purchasable with Stars, a gamified in‑app currency.</p><p>Once the 29,000 hats were gone and the funds secured, Khabib’s announcement posts and promotional videos quietly <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/ufc-mma-news-khabib-nurmagomedov-finally-explains-his-deleted-papakha-posts-after-conor-mcgregor-s-scam-claim/">vanished </a>from Instagram and X, triggering accusations of a “sell‑and‑scrub” maneuver. Conor McGregor, the Irish fighter who is no stranger to crypto-controversies, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgQBM3C17YE">lambasted </a>Khabib for “robbing fans,” while Khabib <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ufc/comments/1p7n0x1/khabib_announces_the_end_of_his_gift_with_value/">defended </a>the papakhas as “exclusive digital gifts with real‑time value” that honored Dagestani tradition.</p><p>The papakha drop was not a one‑off misjudgment. It was the latest example of a pattern that has been building since 2021. In the four years leading up to this sale, Khabib has repeatedly put his name behind a string of speculative crypto, NFT, and “halal” investment ventures that fall short of criminal fraud but seem suspiciously like calculated grifts.</p><div><hr></div><h3><strong>Scheme 1: April 2021 - The Legacy Cards</strong></h3><h4><strong>1. How It Worked</strong></h4><p>Six months after retiring undefeated, Khabib launched his debut into the crypto-sphere. The pitch was elementary: artificially scarce goods based on his 29-0 fighting record. He released a tiered set of digital trading cards (NFTs) featuring 3D renderings of himself.</p><p>The structure was a pyramid of exclusivity:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Gold Cards:</strong> 290 units available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Platinum Cards:</strong> 29 units available.</p></li><li><p><strong>Diamond Card:</strong> Only 1 unit minted.
