the man in the suit has just bought a new car/ From the profit he’s made on your dreams” — Traffic</em></p><p>Leftist online personality Hasan Piker recently took a trip to China, and — like many other <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/american-abroad-how-one-influencer-s-visit-china-turned-tables">influencers</a> who have been there — <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1988685886029246813">declared it to be a paradise</a>, praising “abundance style consumption paired up with a centrally controlled economy” and “1950s Soviet era building blocks next to the Gucci store”.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Meanwhile, pro-China pundits continue to crow about the country’s technological achievements and export performance. </p><p>But when you talk to ordinary Chinese people about what their lives or their families’ lives are like these days, a less rosy picture emerges. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/opinion/china-politics-social-public-mood.html">Helen Gao writes</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Behind the orderliness of everyday life, a <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Hs3MY/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-29/pboc-finds-consumer-mood-is-turning-darker-even-as-economy-grows">quiet desperation</a> simmers. On social media and in private conversations, there is a common refrain: worry over joblessness, wage cuts and making ends meet…</p><p>Internationally, China looks strong…That muscular facade is punctured here in China, where despair about dimming economic and personal prospects is pervasive. This contrast between a confident state and its weary population is captured in a phrase Chinese people are using to describe their country: “wai qiang, zhong gan,” roughly translated as “outwardly strong, inwardly brittle.”…</p><p>Many now feel the very state policies that have made China appear strong overseas are hurting them. They see a government more concerned with building global influence and dominating export markets than in addressing the challenges of their households…These days, there is a sense of bitter anger among the people at being the voiceless victims of the state’s obsession with world power and beating the United States…The government recently began <a href="https://archive.ph/o/Hs3MY/https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/china-censorship-pessimism-despair.html">cracking down</a> on social media content it considered “excessively pessimistic” — a clear sign it is concerned about this public unease undercutting its agenda.</p></blockquote><p>For even more direct insight, I recommend the blog <a href="https://www.readingthechinadream.com/">Reading the China Dream</a>, which translates Chinese writing and online commentary. The blog has <a href="https://www.readingthechinadream.com/youthology-on-chinas-vulnerable-generation.html">a good translation</a> of a recent report from a Chinese marketing company on morale among the youth. Here are some excerpts from the bloggers’ summary:</p><blockquote><p>The text translated here is [the] last of a series meant to sum up 2024 and preview 2025…[T]he tone of the text is unsparingly bleak: the China Dream has stalled and no one knows what to do about it…Chinese young people inherited great expectations from China’s phenomenal economic </p></blockquote>...</source>
