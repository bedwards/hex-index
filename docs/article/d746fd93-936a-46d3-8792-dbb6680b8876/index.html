          <strong>Alfred Nobel</strong>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Nobel&#039;s will and the criteria for the Peace Prize. Understanding Nobel himself—the inventor of dynamite who created the prize partly out of guilt for his invention&#039;s destructive uses—provides rich ironic context for debates about who deserves the peace prize.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;the Saudi murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi&#039; in the context of FIFA&#039;s Infantino selecting Saudi Arabia for the World Cup. The full details of this assassination—ordered at the highest levels of the Saudi government—illuminate the moral compromises being criticized.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions &#039;Cartel de los Soles&#039; as the Venezuelan criminal group Trump designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Understanding what this organization actually is—a loose network of corrupt Venezuelan military officials rather than a hierarchical cartel—is central to evaluating the article&#039;s claims about the justification for military action.</p>

Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.” On Wednesday, the White House <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/03/us/politics/trump-us-institute-peace-name.html">confirmed</a> the renaming, calling it “a powerful reminder of what strong leadership can accomplish for global stability.”</p><p>Actually, it’s a reminder of what a strong malignant narcissist can accomplish when untethered from reality. </p><p>On Friday, Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA, the world football league, awarded Trump the first (and likely last) annual FIFA Peace Prize — along with a hagiographic video of Trump and “peace.”</p><p>What FIFA has to do with peace is anyone’s guess, but Infantino is evidently trying to curry favor with Trump. (Infantino, by the way, oversaw the 2020 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, defending and minimizing Qatar’s miserable human rights record. He also played a key role in selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, notwithstanding the Saudi murder of <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi.)</p><p>Both Trump’s absurd renaming of the U.S. Institute of Peace and the equally absurd FIFA award are parts of Trump’s campaign to get the Nobel Peace Prize — something he has coveted since Barack Obama was awarded it in 2009 (anything Obama got credited with, Trump wants to discredit or match). </p><p>Too late for this year. The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Mar%C3%ADa+Corina+Machado&amp;oq=Nobel+Peace+Prize+2025+winner&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyDAgBEEUYORixAxiABDIHCAIQABiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCTc0MDdqMGoxNagCCLACAfEFvG6HGfsVRRbxBbxuhxn7FUUW&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYj-GC_ayRAxWhLTQIHaiQAEAQgK4QegYIAQgAEAY">María Corina Machado</a> of Venezuela “for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” (The prize is awarded annually on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death, in a formal ceremony at the Oslo City Hall. Trump has his eye on the 2026 prize.)</p><p>Ironically, Trump has declared war on Venezuela, without congressional authorization — causing the death so far of at least 87 people bombed by American military jets targeting vessels <em>allegedly </em>carrying drugs into the United States. </p><p>Those 87 include two people who barely survived a first bombing, only to be bombed again. (Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who saw a video of the second strike in a closed-door briefing, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” yesterday that the two survivors “were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities,” when the follow-up strike took place.)</p><p>Trump has designated a Venezuelan criminal group — Cartel de los Soles — as </p>...</source>
