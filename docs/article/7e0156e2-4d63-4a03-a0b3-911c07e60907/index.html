        <p>For over 2,000 years, humanity insisted that infinity was only <em>potential</em> (roughly, this means you can always add “one more,” but you never actually arrive). Aristotle thought so; Gauss just said so. Then Cantor showed up with a sort of hearsay we’re still fighting about to this day.</p><p><strong>He treated infinite collections as completed objects in and of themselves.</strong> Then he proved there are strictly more of them than anyone imagined. Kronecker called Cantor a “corrupter of youth.” Poincaré called Cantor’s work a “disease.” <strong>Cantor died in a sanatorium.</strong> </p><p>Turns out, Cantor was right all along. Here’s what’s going on.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png" width="603" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:603,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:680425,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://curtjaimungal.substack.com/i/187960630?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IvXw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35401081-34ed-43b0-a893-d961d600fea9_603x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h1>Potential vs. Actual</h1><p>The distinction is sharper than it sounds. A <em>potential</em> infinity is a <strong>process</strong>: you keep counting 1, 2, 3, ... and you never stop. At no point do you hold “the completed collection of all natural numbers” in your hand. An <em>actual</em> infinity says: that collection exists, right now, as a single object. You can examine its properties. You can compare it to other collections. You can ask difficult questions about its “size.” You get the idea. <strong>Cantor’s great heresy was insisting on the latter, and then doing some math with it.</strong></p><p>His first discovery was peculiar: <strong>there are just as many even numbers as natural numbers.</strong> This is because you have to be specific as to what you mean by “just as many” (or “size” AKA “cardinality”). Two sets are of the same “size” if you can pair them up <em>exactly</em>.</p><p>Here’s how it looks for the even numbers with the full natural numbers. Pair 1↔2, 2↔4, 3↔6, ... You’ll notice nothing’s left over. Same for the integers. Same for the rationals (which seems absurd, since the rationals are <em>dense</em> in the real line). But Cantor found a <em>bijection</em> (a one-to-one pairing) between <strong>ℕ</strong> and <strong>ℚ</strong>. The exact way you can form these pairings is clever and too much for these margins, but you can look it up.</p><h1>All Countable Infinities Are Secretly Twins</h1><p>The lesson is that <strong>every countable infinite set you throw at Cantor turns out to have the same “size.”</strong> Because he’s a mathematician and wants no ambiguity, he stopped using the <strong>∞</strong> symbol and called this size <em><strong>ℵ</strong></em><strong>₀</strong> (aleph-null). Intuitively, it seems like all infinities are equal.</p><p>After all, think about it. If you add 157 to <strong>∞</strong> you just get <strong>∞</strong>. Same if you do <strong>∞</strong> </p>...</source>
