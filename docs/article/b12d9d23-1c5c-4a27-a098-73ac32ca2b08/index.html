You did your <a href="https://a.co/d/ftXwCZZ">dissertation</a> about this idea of détente and how it evolved from the ’50s all the way through the end of the Reagan administration. Coming to your conclusion, the echoes of where we are today and that theme seem to be very striking.

Détente suffered no greater liability than the public’s perception that the Soviets exploited it at the United States’ expense. To be reciprocal, however, U.S. policy must embody reasonable expectations.”</p><p><strong>Mike Froman:</strong> I thought I was writing a historic piece. The end of the Cold War came. I put the book on the shelf, thought it would never be opened again. And yet, Jordan, there you found it and indeed have highlighted that there might be some relevance to the U.S.-China relationship today.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> I played this game with<a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/kurt-campbell-on-grand-strategy-and-e84"> Kurt Campbell</a>. He did his <a href="https://a.co/d/7Xyi9Dx">thesis</a> on Soviet relations with South Africa and the tensions of how the U.S. navigated that dynamic. Everything’s coming back.</p><p>We’re sitting here in the fall of 2025. We have a president who is probably as far towards the “let’s do détente” mindset as you could have gotten in this political moment. What do you think are the bounds of what an American president today could domestically go towards if they were in a détente mindset?</p><p><strong>Mike Froman:</strong> The issue of détente back in the old Soviet days was — was it a strategy to transform the Soviet Union by engaging with it, or was it a reflection that we had to engage with it because we had ...</p>
