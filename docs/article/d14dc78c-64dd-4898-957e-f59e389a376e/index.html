Even if you don't have them specifically training you, it's possible that you can look at what they do and try to copy what they're doing and hopefully become just as good, if not better than your example. Not because you want to take over and stop your example from doing what they want, but because you admire them. You want them to admire you, while at the same time you want to become the kind of person other people can look up to. A second example to give the world more positive examples. Because more is actually better, or so it seems.</p><p>Of course, those examples you're looking up to didn't come pre-packaged with all the knowledge and experience they have now. It took forever to get there and because of that, they know they made mistakes along the way. So if and when they do become an example for others like you, they have to make sure that you know you can't just get there overnight. Just because you know that you might be able to do something incredible, doesn't mean you should actually try it. You might need to do the work, slow down and go through the steps of learning easier things. That way you can build up to the harder things which are so worthwhile.</p><p>Previously in this space, we've looked at the how to <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-1-the-beginning">start the journey</a> of self-improvement. Then we looked at what it takes to <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-2-working-harder">work harder</a> and push yourself further than you had originally planned. After that we considered the <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-3-achieving-goals">importance of making goals</a> and trying to achieve them in specific ways. More recently we looked at the <a href="https://tvphilosophy.substack.com/p/the-flash-season-4-facing-obstacles">obstacles which can get in your way</a> of making improvements. Doing that can make you feel frustrated and want to try and get over the difficulties. Enough that skipping steps feels like the right thing to do. But is it?</p><blockquote><p>“See it takes time to hone your skills Nora. You can't just skip rungs on the ladder and jump right to the big stuff. That's not how it works. Take a moment, think before you act, fix the problem the right way.”</p></blockquote><p>This is very much where we find </p>...</source>
