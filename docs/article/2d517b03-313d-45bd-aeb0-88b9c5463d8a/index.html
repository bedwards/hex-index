        <p>On this week’s episode, <a href="https://tedmorrissey.com/">Ted Morrissey</a> (author, creator of <em><a href="https://thetunnelat25.com/">The Tunnel</a></em><a href="https://thetunnelat25.com/"> at 25</a>) joins Kaija, Brian, and Chad to talk about “Koh Whistles Up a Wind” and how to approach <em>The Tunnel </em>overall. (He also unveils what he thinks is Gass’s <em>real </em>masterpiece—you’ll have to listen to the end to find out.) They talk about the “trap” Gass set for reviewers, enticing them to identify him with Kohler, about the “milk crate edition,” and other aspects of the making of this novel, about the realization Ted has about page 92, and much more.</p><p>This episode’s music is “Sincere” by Roger Sellers.</p><p>Next week we’ll cover the second section, “We Have Not Lived the Right Life” (pages 49–146).
