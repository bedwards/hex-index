        <p>Hi friends, I want to post about an insane thing that happened to me. Like, this story is so wild, I am still struggling to process it.</p><p>But, okay, there is a backstory here. And I'm not totally certain how to present it to you. For starters: I live in a fascist country.</p><p>You might think that you know what country I'm talking about, but you probably don't, because there are so many examples nowadays of countries that have adopted this particular form of fascism.</p><p>In this country, I live in the capital, and I attend a large private high school that's a lot like an American high school, because it's mostly intended for the kids of American Embassy staff, diplomats, multinational workers, and anyone else who doesn't want to enroll their kids in our country’s local school system.</p><p>My mom is a university professor, my dad works for a multinational treaty organization—a term that probably means nothing to most of you—it's something like the United Nations or World Health Organization, but it's not either of those things. Many people would claim my dad's employer is evil, but I think it's more accurate to say his organization is just very ineffective at achieving its mission (alleviating global poverty).</p><p>Anyway, I am very tall (6' 5"), especially for this country, where people stereotypically tend to be quite short. I am pretty shy, bookish, don't have many friends, and don't get particularly good grades, either! </p><p>Because I'm a tall guy, I attract a lot of attention, and people are often disappointed that I’m not more athletic. I've been called "a waste of height" by a number of men and boys.</p><p>That's very important context for this story: I am not considered cool at all.</p><p>You'd think that because I am willing to call out the fascism in this country, I'd be considered cool and rebellious, but that's not how it works under real fascism. Under real fascism, when you mention the word 'fascism' people will either do one of two things: a) fall silent and ignore you; or b) immediately start arguing with you about the meaning of the word 'fascist' and all the many ways your own society doesn't resemble Hitler's Germany at all.</p><p>These arguments aren't particularly convincing to me, I think fascism is really the only appropriate word. But I'm not that good at arguing. Like I said, I'm ...</p>
