        <p>Thank you, subscribers, for <a href="https://sarahkendzior.substack.com/p/just-answering-questions-anything">your thoughtful questions</a>!

No one can take it away.</p><p>As my children get older, it’s harder to talk with them about the future. When they were small, I felt protective. As my oldest prepares to leave home, I feel afraid.
