They’re tokens with a relatively stable value within a specific software or product ecosystem, often managed by an issuer (like a company). Think of them like the blockchain-based equivalent of airline miles, credit card points, in-game digital gold, and so on.</p><p>All of these are currencies that are internal to, and support the functioning of, a marketplace economy. For example, frequent flyer miles and rewards points can encourage brand loyalty and be used for flight upgrades.</p><p>While companies have used assets like these for decades, almost all previous instances have existed on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/why-decentralization-matters-incentivizing-decentralization-incentives/">centralized databases</a>, limiting ownership, transferability, and user choice. Arcade tokens on public blockchains differ in that they are open, interoperable, and composable, which gives them a range of new market design benefits.</p><p>To expand on the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/defining-tokens/">7 different types of tokens</a> we’ve shared, <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/arcade-tokens/">this new post</a> answers the most common questions we’ve heard about arcade tokens: what they are, what they do, why they have value, how builders can use them, the design tradeoffs they entail, and the opportunities they present.</p><h2>More on what is — and isn’t — an arcade token</h2><p>At a technical level, arcade tokens are just digital currencies intended for spending within their associated application ecosystems — with supply and demand managed flexibly to maintain price stability. Think of them foremost as <em>currencies within a digital economy</em>.</p><p>Whether or not you’ve visited an arcade, you’re probably familiar with the concept. You go inside; you trade cash for tokens, typically physical ones; then you use those tokens to play a few rounds ...</p>
