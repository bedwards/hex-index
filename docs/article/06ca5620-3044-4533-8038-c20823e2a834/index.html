New Orleans, a city known for big groups of people going out and having fun together, was suffering especially during the covid lockdown—an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/03/02/new-orleans-bookstore-baldwin-co/">economic report</a> showed their small businesses closing at nearly double the national median rate—when returned native son DJ Johnson opened the bookstore and cafe in 2021, <a href="https://www.verylocal.com/nola-art-bar-bookstore-wine-bar/23282/">presciently saying</a> he was anxious to return people to gathering face to face. He had already opened an art bar on the same block, property he had bought recently near where he grew up, with <a href="https://www.verylocal.com/nola-art-bar-bookstore-wine-bar/23282/">the goal of providing</a> a gathering place that “could be an artistic home for creatives and intellectuals” in New Orleans, a place “where you can come and engage in stimulating conversations over cocktails and discuss some pending political, social, and economic issues with a nice atmosphere.” He <a href="https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/baldwin-co-coffee-and-bookstore-new-orleans/">has spoken</a> of fostering places where “the chairs fill with some of the brightest minds in the city: politicians, professors, entrepreneurs, students, and engaged residents.” “It’s hard to find those spaces in New Orleans,” <a href="https://www.verylocal.com/nola-art-bar-bookstore-wine-bar/23282/">he has said</a>, “particularly being Black-owned.”</p><p>This vision of creating a point of connection that would be fun, enriching, and empowering was coalescing in his vision for the bookstore. “I wanted to provide nourishment for the soul of New Orleans,” he <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/ask-a-local-48-hours-in-new-orleans-with-bookstore-owner-dj-johnson">said</a>. <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/ask-a-local-48-hours-in-new-orleans-with-bookstore-owner-dj-johnson">And</a><br><em>I wanted to create an intellectual hub for Blacks in the city. It was important for us to have a space where we felt like we could go and create. Go where we can feel like the best version of ourselves. Somewhere we have access to information and access to our greatest thinkers within our history and legacy. A lot of times, you know, we don’t know how powerful we can be until we read our history. I wanted to create a space where that history lived on the shelves and was a testament to our greatness.<br></em>He <a href="https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/baldwin-co-coffee-and-bookstore-new-orleans/">saw</a> the company of books as “a school of enlightenment.” He has invoked the old cultures of the coffee house “penny university,” a bookstore as a gathering of minds.</p><p>He associated this vision with the work of James Baldwin, which he had discovered as a readerly child in a family in which a single mother of seven encouraged reading among her children and </p>...</source>
