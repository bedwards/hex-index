        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to m</em>e.</p><h3>17% of CDLs might get purged</h3><p>Most extensive Capacity Purge in History Coming. Freight is on the brink of a historic capacity purge: up to 600,000 drivers (≈17%) could exit as weak volumes, tighter fraud controls, and new FMCSA rules on non-domiciled CDLs and English proficiency squeeze supply. Expect a wave of carrier/broker failures, stricter capacity, and COVID-like spot-rate spikes; larger, well-capitalized fleets with compliance muscle are positioned to gain as wages/bonuses rise to attract qualified drivers. Highway notes rising “fraud” flags reflect better detection in its adaptive system, but any flag can still lock carriers out of brokerage freight, raising execution risk for smaller operators.

UPS is committed to adding 28,000 air-conditioned delivery trucks in its current national contract. The 5,000 retrofits will help expedite that. The first 2,000 vehicles readied under the agreement will be retrofitted by June 1, 2026. Air conditioning will be added to all 5,000 delivery trucks by June 1, 2027, and dispatched to the Teamsters’ hottest delivery areas, mainly in Southern and Southwest states.

Three of the additional flights will operate to Paris from FedEx’s Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport base, while the other two will operate from Changi Airport in Singapore. The express firm said that the expansion of capacity on its services between Asia Pacific and Europe reflects recent growth on the trade lane. FedEx cited IATA statistics showing 30 consecutive months of trade growth and a 13% year-on-year increase in August. FedEx now operates 26 weekly flights connecting the Asia Pacific and Europe.
