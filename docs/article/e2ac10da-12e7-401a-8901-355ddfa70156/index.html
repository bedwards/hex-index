        <p>I’m reposting one of my most popular piece (originally hosted on Medium). Apologies if you’re read it already!   This is a counter-factual I’m often asked about and about which I keep reconsidering my views. </p><div><hr></div><p>This question is prompted by <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Wicked-Book-One-Rules/dp/0994384092/">Kingdom of the Wicked</a>, </em>a new book by Helen Dale. Dale forces us to consider Jesus as a religious extremist in a Roman world not unlike our own. The novel throws new light on our own attitudes to terrorism, globalization, torture, and the clash of cultures. It is highly recommended.</p><p>Indirectly, however, Dale also addresses the possibility of sustained economic growth in the ancient world. The novel is set in a 1st century Roman empire during the governorship of Pontus Pilate and the reign of Tiberius. But in this alternative history, the Mediterranean world has experienced a series of technical innovations following the survival of Archimedes at the siege of Syracuse, which have led to rapid economic growth. As Dale explains in the book’s excellent afterword (published separately <a href="https://www.libertarianism.org/publications/essays/authors-note-kingdom-wicked">here</a>), if Rome had experienced an industrial revolution, it would likely have differed from the actual one; and she briefly plots a path to Roman industrialization. All of this is highly stimulating and has prompted me to speculate further about whether Rome could have experienced modern economic growth and if Dale’s proposed path towards a Roman Industrial Revolution is plausible.</p><p><strong>Roman Economic Prosperity</strong></p><p>For decades, historians were deeply skeptical of the potential of the ancient world to generate sustained economic growth. Influenced by Moses Finlay and Karl Polanyi, historians saw the ancient and modern worlds as separated by a cultural and economic chasm. Prior to the Industrial Revolution-era leaping of this chasm, individuals supposedly lacked “economic rationality,” did not seek opportunities to maximize profit, and were disinclined to use new technology for economic purposes.</p><p>This view is no longer credible. In his recent book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Rome-Climate-Disease-Princeton/dp/0691166838/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1509561181&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+fate+of+rome">The Fate of Rome</a></em>, <a href="http://www.ou.edu/flourish/about/team/harper.html">Kyle Harper</a> depicts a Roman economy which supported both population growth and rising per capita incomes. It was an economy in which inequality was high— the rich were super rich — but even the middling classes or urban poor had access to a wide range of premodern “consumer goods”. Moreover, according to Harper, this was based on market-orientated Smithian growth:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Peace, law, and transportation infrastructure fostered the capillary penetration of markets everywhere. The clearing of piracy from the Mediterranean in the late </em></p>...</blockquote>
