It was, of course, written in a somewhat hyperbolic fashion, which is something I like to do sometimes. (I don’t know why some readers seem unable to grasp that writers sometime exaggerate their feelings for argumentative or comedic or stylistic effect.) It seems a lot of people were also dissatisfied with that first batch of Season Five episodes too. Well, while I thought the finale was a bit better than the rest of the season, I still think the show really fell on its face in the final lap - and I think the specific <em>ways </em>the show got worse speaks to a lot of problems with modern pop culture storytelling. <em>Stranger Things </em>suffered from specific and particular issues, but also from structural problems with how serialized stories are written and produced now.</p><p>To be clear, and to be fair, <em>Stranger Things </em>was never going to be my… thing. That’s largely thanks to the nerd-worship issues I discussed in that earlier piece, which is kind of the heart of the show. And I am really deeply bothered by the way the Duffer Brothers play fast and loose with 80s pop culture history. I’ve mentioned several times that the idea of a 14 year old from suburban Indiana being obsessed with Kate Bush bothers me, and a few people have asked me why that particular detail would be a problem in a show about telekinetic teenagers and demons from another dimension. The reason is pretty straightforward: <em>Stranger Things </em>is an act of celebration and worship of 1980s pop culture. That’s superficially obvious and the Duffer Brothers have said it explicitly many times. Well, if you’re demanding I take 80s pop culture references seriously, which the show is very much doing, then I demand that we tell the truth about 80s pop culture. An honest show would have had that character be obsessed with Bon Jovi’s “Living on a Prayer” or “Higher Love” by Stevie Winwood, not “Running Up That Hill.” The trouble is that those songs aren’t cool to a 2020s audience, while Kate Bush will always be cool, so they did the cool thing instead of the authentically 80s thing.
