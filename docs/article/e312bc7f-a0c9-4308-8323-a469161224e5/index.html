        <p><strong>Thoughts of the day</strong></p><p>Hello friends,</p><p>The end of the summer break is near for many, and has already arrived for some. It has also been a long break for Brain Food, perhaps longer than intended. But as the law of reversed effort suggests, it is important not to always <a href="https://brainfood.substack.com/p/brain-food-839-the-law-of-reversed">swim against the current</a>, and to allow oneself to float from time to time.</p><p>In such moments, the turning of pages, there is an incongruence in our perception of time as it becomes disjointed: we reminisce about the past, we worry about or try to plan or imagine the future, while all this takes place in the present, which inevitably, invariably, gets neglected.&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s poem is about easing back into it, about learning to be in the life that is. As David Foster Wallace wrote: <strong>“our endless and impossible journey toward home is in fact our home.”</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Monday<br></strong><em>by Alex Dimitrov</em></p><p>I was just beginning<br>to wonder about my own life<br>and now I have to return to it<br>regardless of the weather<br>or how close I am to love.<br>Doesn’t it bother you sometimes<br>what living is, what the day has turned into?<br>So many screens and meetings<br>and things to be late for.<br>Everyone truly deserves<br>a flute of champagne<br>for having made it this far!<br>Though it’s such a disaster<br>to drink on a Monday.<br>To imagine who you would be<br>if you hadn’t crossed the street<br>or married, if you hadn’t<br>agreed to the job or the money<br>or how time just keeps going—<br>whoever agreed to that<br>has clearly not seen<br>the beginning of summer<br>or been to a party<br>or let themselves float<br>in the middle of a book<br>where for however briefly<br>it’s possible to stay longer than<br>you should. Unfortunately<br>for me and you, we have<br>the rest of it to get to.<br>We must pretend<br>there’s a blue painting<br>at the end of this poem.<br>And every time we look at it<br>we forget about ourselves.<br>And every time it looks at us<br>it forgives us for pain.</p><div><hr></div><p>A blue painting for the end of the poem.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg" width="1456" height="1182" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1182,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;T01571&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="T01571" title="T01571" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDm1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6893dfd4-2aac-4d73-8c3c-333423bd5776_1536x1247.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Nocturne: Blue and Silver</em> - Chelsea, 1871, by James Abbott McNeill Whistler</figcaption></figure></div><div><hr></div><h6><em>I write Brain Food out of my own desire and willingness to share what I find interesting and to inspire others, and help them see life in a different light.
