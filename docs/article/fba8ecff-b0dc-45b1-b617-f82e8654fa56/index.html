        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how &#039;God is love&#039; is a non-reciprocating statement about God&#039;s nature. Divine simplicity is the theological doctrine that God&#039;s attributes (love, goodness, being) are identical with God&#039;s essence, directly relevant to understanding this claim.</p>

        <p>From my <em>1, 2 &amp; 3 John: Living a Life in Light and Love</em>, in the Everyday Bible Study series, with questions from Becky Castle Miller, who writes a <a href="https://beckycastlemiller.substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p><p>1 John 4:7-21</p><p><strong><sup>4:7 </sup>Dear friends, let us </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> one another, for </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. <sup>8</sup> Whoever does not </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> does not know God, because God is </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong>. <sup>9</sup> This is how God showed his </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. <sup>10</sup> This is </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong>: not that we </strong><em><strong>loved</strong></em><strong> God, but that he </strong><em><strong>loved</strong></em><strong> us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. <sup>11</sup> Dear friends, since God so </strong><em><strong>loved</strong></em><strong> us, we also ought to </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> one another. <sup>12</sup> No one has ever seen God; but if we </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> one another, God lives in us and his </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> is made complete in us.</strong></p><p><strong><sup>13 </sup>This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. <sup>14</sup> And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. <sup>15</sup> If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.<sup>16</sup> And so we know and rely on the </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> God has for us.</strong></p><p><strong>God is </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong>. Whoever lives in </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> lives in God, and God in them. <sup>17</sup> This is how </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. <sup>18</sup> There is no fear in </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong>. But perfect </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong><sup>19 </sup>We </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> because he first </strong><em><strong>loved</strong></em><strong> us. <sup>20</sup> Whoever claims to </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> God, whom they have not seen. <sup>21</sup> And he has given us this command: Anyone who </strong><em><strong>loves</strong></em><strong> God must also </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> their brother and sister.</strong></p><p>Count the italicized words in today’s reading. My tally is twenty-seven. Three times more than the number of times love appears ...</p>
