Developed by uniQure, the therapy delivers a viral vector carrying microRNA into the striatum, where it silences the mutant <em>huntingtin </em>gene and lowers toxic protein levels. Participants tolerated the procedure well, though the required brain surgery remains invasive. The promising results, if replicated, could usher in a new era for gene-based neurology, where permanent molecular “muzzles” replace lifelong symptom management, but questions of durability, safety, and access linger as costs are expected to exceed $1 million per patient currently. <strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03139-9">Read More</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Can ageing clocks guide cancer immunotherapy?</strong><br>A new review connects cellular senescence, the stress-induced, permanent cell-cycle arrest that shapes both tumour suppression and progression, with the rise of ageing clocks that quantify biological rather than chronological age. The authors trace how senescent cells, through the p53/p21 and p16/Rb axes and their pro-inflammatory secretome </p></li>...</ul>
