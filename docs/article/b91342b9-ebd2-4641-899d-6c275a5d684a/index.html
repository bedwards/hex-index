I suspect that Klinger was the first man I had ever seen in a dress, a fact only slightly more confronting, at the time, than the fact that Jamie Farr was the first person I had ever seen of Lebanese descent. (Mount Gambier was, in the early 1990s, still pretty blindingly white.)</p><p>Later, as I was getting into cinema, I watched the 1970 Altman movie and loved it. Altman’s version, for all its misogynistic flaws, remains a kind of masterpiece. It certainly set the template for his career: the inquisitive, constantly moving camera, the jarring mid-pan cuts, the overzealous use of the zoom, the overlayed-to-the-point-of-muddy audio. (He perfected the style the following year with <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller</em>, which is near to as perfect a film as I know, and also a cornerstone entry in one of my favourite genres: the alt-Western.)</p><p>The lingering trauma of having <em>The Simpsons</em> withheld from me, and the genuine affection I held for Altman’s film, meant that the series never appealed itself to me. While it had been sneaking onto my radar (no pun intended) for a couple of years—not least during the pandemic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYGdR3pOR5I">when Alan Alda hosted an episode of </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYGdR3pOR5I">Clear and Vivid</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYGdR3pOR5I"> with his former co-stars</a>, and then again in 2022, when the show celebrated its fiftieth anniversary with a slew of documentaries and think-pieces—I’m still not entirely sure what compelled me to watch it, in its entirety, this year. Usually, when I’m in a funk, I’ll rewatch <em>Seinfeld</em> or <em>The West Wing</em>.</p><p><em>M*A*S*H</em>, it turns out, is better than either.</p><p>Of course, it’s really three shows masquerading as one, or rather one that is better thought of as three, or as having three distinct periods. (This is in contrast to <em>Cheers</em>, which is the same show played twice at different speeds, or <em>Frasier</em>, which is one show played, to its benefit, on a loop. I’ll be writing about these </p>...</source>
