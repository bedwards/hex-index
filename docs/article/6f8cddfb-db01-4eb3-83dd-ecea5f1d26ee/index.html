        <p>From recent Oscar winners and nominees <em>Parasite</em>, <em>Nomadland,</em> <em>The Florida Project</em>, and <em>Roma</em>, to recent TV hits like <em>Severance </em>and Netflix’s <em>Squid Games</em>, films and television series with workplace depictions and underlying economic issues as driving themes have become increasingly popular.&nbsp;</p><p>Writer and Director Fernando León de Aranoa has often explored economic and class issues in his films. A few examples include his 2002 film <em>Mondays in the Sun</em>, also starring Javier Bardem, about a group of unemployed shipyard workers, the 1998 film <em>Barrio</em> about three teens living in a poor neighborhood of Madrid, Spain, and his 2005 film <em>Princesses</em> which features two sex workers as the protagonists.&nbsp;</p><p>Spain’s 2022 submission for the Academy Awards Best International Feature category and the most nominated film in the history of the Goya Awards is Fernando León de Aranoa’s &nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jul/17/the-good-boss-review-javier-bardem-bosses-it-in-unsubtle-spanish-satire">The Good Boss.</a></em> The film takes a different approach to recent films with workplace depictions, choosing to focus on the boss, the individual in power over a workplace. <em>The Good Boss’s </em>titular character is named Julio Blanco and played by Javier Bardem.

There is no solidarity, there is no support between them,” said De Aranoa. “For this particular film I was trying to bring different ideas about how this is something that I feel it's happening, how 10 years later, those bonds and solidarity are missing. It’s not as strong as it used to be 20 or 40 years ago and I was trying to tell what happens when ...</p>
