          <strong>Shtetl</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with a 1917 painting titled &#039;City–Shtetl&#039; by Issachar Ber Ryback. Understanding what a shtetl was—the small Jewish towns of Eastern Europe that were largely destroyed in the Holocaust—provides crucial historical context for Ukrainian-Jewish history and the cultural significance of this artwork from the National Art Museum of Ukraine.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses ongoing Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations. The Minsk agreements (2014-2015) represent the most significant prior attempt to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and understanding their failures provides essential context for why current negotiations are so fraught with internal and external resistance.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The Venezuela section references Trump&#039;s &#039;Caribbean objectives&#039; and &#039;Operation Southern Spear&#039; with a third of the US Navy deployed. The Monroe Doctrine—the 1823 policy asserting US dominance in the Western Hemisphere—is the historical foundation for American intervention in Caribbean and Latin American affairs.</p>

RUSSIA.</strong> Chain refraction</h2><p><strong>Negotiations encounter resistance from inside and out.</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to discuss a peace plan with Donald Trump after officials said they agreed to its “essence”. Trump said Steve Witkoff would meet with Vladimir Putin and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll with Ukraine.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>INTELLIGENCE. </strong>Trump, Zelensky and Putin are getting nearer to an agreement, driving oil prices lower, but officials (and Europe) are still maximising positions. That’s their job, but the inherent tensions are spilling into the open, with mysterious transcripts between Witkoff and the Kremlin published overnight by Bloomberg and allegations of impropriety made against Jared Kushner, who has reappeared in talks, despite having no formal US government role.</p><p><strong>FOR BUSINESS. </strong>The policy dispute within Washington is nothing compared to that within Kyiv, where the feud between national security and anti-corruption officials dominates non-war headlines. Deep disagreement exists even in Moscow, whether in the alleged Witkoff transcripts, or the pro-Kremlin media debate on whether Putin should even be negotiating. Some of this is fabricated, again for negotiating reasons, but it also suggests haste and vulnerability.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>Geopolitical Dispatch is the client briefing of Geopolitical Strategy.

Deployments under Operation Southern Spear increased with reports a third of the US Navy was in theatre.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>INTELLIGENCE. </strong>Precise deployment data is hard to obtain using open sources.</p>
