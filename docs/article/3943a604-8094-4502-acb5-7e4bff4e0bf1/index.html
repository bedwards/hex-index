And the reaction on social media was exactly what you’d expect to hear from environmentalists on the left.</p><p>“<a href="https://x.com/uTobian/status/2024310634389831727">Absolutely disgusting and shameful</a>”</p><p>“<a href="https://x.com/RenzTom/status/2024588583060062511">Literally no justification for the way this was done</a>”</p><p>“<a href="https://x.com/amtoxicology/status/2024463340731584727">A middle finger to public health</a>”</p><p>But these posts didn’t come from Trump’s progressive critics. They came from some of his most enthusiastic supporters: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/maha-activists-warn-trump-could-lose-their-support-over-glyphosate-order-2026-02-20/">influencers</a> who <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2026/02/ewg-trumps-glyphosate-executive-order-big-middle-finger-every">identify</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/20/maha-unleashes-on-white-house-after-trump-backs-pesticide-00790187">Make America Healthy Again</a> movement.</p><p>MAHA is the loose coalition of activists, social media figures, and like-minded voters who believe America is being slowly poisoned by the food and pharmaceutical industries. Their preoccupations include fighting environmental toxins and hawking wellness products, promoting natural diets, and challenging mainstream science on vaccines.</p><p>In 2024, they threw their support behind the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who had <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj.r871.short">adopted</a> the MAHA slogan as a twist on Trump’s MAGA branding. The informal coalition got behind Trump after Kennedy withdrew from the race and Trump <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2025/08/mahas-moment-truth-will-rfk-jr-stand-people-harmed-pesticides">embraced</a> Kennedy and his agenda.</p><p>Early on, they felt their faith was being rewarded. Trump tapped Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, with a <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-president-elect-donald-j-trump-announcing-the-nomination-robert-f-kennedy-jr">mandate</a> to “ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.”</p><p>But that was then. In the wake of Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/02/promoting-the-national-defense-by-ensuring-an-adequate-supply-of-elemental-phosphorus-and-glyphosate-based-herbicides/">executive order</a> and a series of episodes leading up to it, MAHA’s leaders say they feel like Trump has betrayed their trust and, in the process, alienated their followers.</p><p>“Have we ever lost the midterms this early or is this a new record?,” the conservative, MAHA-adjacent podcaster Alex Clark <a href="https://x.com/yoalexrapz/status/2024338264069455958">tweeted</a>.</p><p>The question was rhetorical and, obviously, the fate of the GOP’s congressional majorities won’t depend on MAHA’s mood alone. But it’s not hard to see why Clark and her fellow MAHA faithful have so many doubts about Trump’s true priorities—and why those doubts are evidence of a significant fissure that’s developed within his coalition.</p><div><hr></div><p>“I READ AN ARTICLE TODAY,” Trump said during his January 2026 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/lT62rXuOAh4?t=3282s">cabinet meeting</a>, “where they think Bobby is going to be really great for the Republican party in the midterms.”</p><p>The article he had in mind ran in <em><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/26/rfk-jr-food-vaccine-policies-00748061">Politico</a></em>. </p>...</source>
