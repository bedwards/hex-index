          <strong>John Dewey</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Dewey is explicitly named as the leading philosopher of progressive education in the United States. Understanding his philosophy of pragmatism, his concept of experiential learning, and his influence on democratic education provides essential context for the progressive education movement the article discusses.</p>

          <span class="read-time">10 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Sudbury model democratic schools as a key example of Self-Directed Education in practice. Understanding how these schools operate—with no curriculum, age-mixing, and student governance through democratic meetings—illustrates the concrete implementation of SDE philosophy.</p>

          <span class="read-time">17 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article identifies unschoolers as practitioners of Self-Directed Education. This educational philosophy, pioneered by John Holt, represents a radical departure from both traditional and progressive education, and understanding its principles helps clarify the SDE approach the author advocates.</p>
