Chris Wright, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lilyogburn/2025/08/13/how-trumps-energy-secretary-built-a-100-million-fortune/">the massively wealthy former fracking executive who leads the DOE</a>, is currently on <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09092025/energy-secretary-chris-wright-fossil-fuels-europe/">a multi-day, taxpayer-funded trip to Europe</a> to tell world leaders that the climate crisis is not really a big deal, and that the best way to protect their citizens is actually to buy more American gas. </p><p>Given the falsehoods Wright has been spreading, and the conflict of interest Wright has in spreading them, I’m surprised this hasn’t been a bigger story. It’s a staggering example of state-sponsored disinformation and regulatory capture by Big Oil.</p><p>But more than that, it’s a transparent example of a super rich guy trying to con the world into buying more of the thing that made him super rich, so he can become even richer once he leaves office. </p><h4>A fracking executive peddles climate denial in Europe</h4><p>This week, Wright attended the <a href="https://fox4kc.com/business/press-releases/ein-presswire/847102261/gastech-2025-to-welcome-global-energy-leaders-for-industry-defining-dialogue-on-security-innovation-and-transformation/">GasTech 2025 Strategic Conference</a> in Milan, one of the world’s largest gatherings of fossil fuel industry executives and government energy ministers. He also attended a briefing at the European Union headquarters in Brussels on Thursday, and an annual conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on Friday.</p><p>At all three stops, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/climate/wright-energy-offshore-wind-turbines.html">Wright </a>denounced U.S. and EU efforts to transition away from fossil fuels, and encouraged the EU to increase exports of American liquified methane gas, or LNG. </p><p>In an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/05/climate/wright-energy-offshore-wind-turbines.html">interview</a> previewing his core messages for the trip, Wright said Europe’s planned transition away from fossil fuels is useless because climate change isn’t that big a deal. “Climate change, for impacting the quality of your life, is not incredibly important,” he told the Council of Foreign Relations in a fireside chat <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKpFGKKX6Os">on Friday</a>. “In fact, if it wasn't in the news and the media, you wouldn't know it.” </p><p>Wright repeated those claims in Europe on Thursday, and <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/59938">said climate change could actually be a good thing</a> because a “warmer, wetter world is more conducive to </p>...</source>
