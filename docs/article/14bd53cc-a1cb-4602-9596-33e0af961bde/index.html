        <p class="topic-summary">The story&#039;s title and structure deliberately parodies Thomas Jefferson&#039;s 1785 book, using &#039;Query&#039; sections that mirror Jefferson&#039;s original format. Understanding the source material reveals the literary allusion and satirical intent.</p>

Her left side is to our right, that is, east by our visual compass. Thus, Virginia, as we face her, is bounded on the east by an arm—her left—imbued with dominance over its right-side counterpart. It hangs gracefully from its originating joint, culminating below in the tip of a middle digit, tap, tap, tapping on the thigh of her left lower limb.   </p><p>	Next, at 5’ 9” from ground, is the top of her head, which is properly formed and tightly crowned by a hat of mostly woolen composition of deep blue with an American flag stitched on the eastern side (a gift to members of the United States women’s 2015 U-18 ice hockey world championship team). Kicking out from under the hat’s lower perimeter are browner-than-blonde strands of the young woman’s hair.</p><p>	Then to our left, the western shore. From the shoulder, a descending right arm takes a southwesterly jut outward—an arm that once, not long ago, suffered fracture of its humerus (surgery by Dr. Stanis) and which carried a plaster cast that protected Virginia from further injury (and which was inscribed by friends with various scientific formulas, images, art, and notable numbers—no words permitted!). </p><p>	Absent east-west symmetry at this juncture, the angled right arm turns southeasterly toward the medial line to a right hand fixed at the hip on denim-covered pelvic structures that move outward in proper mature fashion, thus beginning a line of catching curvatures characterizing ...</p>
