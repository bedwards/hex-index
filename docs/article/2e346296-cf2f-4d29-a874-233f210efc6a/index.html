Blood is compulsory—they’re all blood, you see.”</p><p>Thus does Stoppard broad-brush the entire catalogue of William Shakespeare.</p><p>In 1995, I had just graduated from college, found a job in the video library of an advertising agency, and was living for a few months in the Jersey suburbs with my parents. <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em>, the film version of the play, starring Tim Roth and Gary Oldman and directed by Stoppard, had come out a few years prior, putting the playwright on our radar—“our” being me and my friend Chris, who was also living in my parents’ house while we waited to move to an apartment in Hoboken. </p><p>That was the year, and the season, that Stoppard’s new play, “Arcadia,” opened at Lincoln Center. And we must have hung around the city after work one summer day and taken in the show during the week, because <a href="https://playbill.com/production/arcadia-vivian-beaumont-theatre-vault-0000011241#carousel-cell180664">according to </a><em><a href="https://playbill.com/production/arcadia-vivian-beaumont-theatre-vault-0000011241#carousel-cell180664">Playbill</a></em><a href="https://playbill.com/production/arcadia-vivian-beaumont-theatre-vault-0000011241#carousel-cell180664">,</a> the play only ran from March through the end of August 1995—and I definitely saw it.</p><p>But then, my memory is faulty. I also recall that the actor playing Septimus Hodge was a dashing young Rufus Sewell. But no less an authority than the World Wide Web has it that, while Sewell originated the role in the London production, he didn’t come to New York; the Broadway production starred an also-dashing Billy Crudup. But why, if I had not seen Rufus Sewell in “Arcadia,” would I remember the name Rufus Sewell, long before Rufus Sewell came back into my consciousness playing the American Nazi in <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>? Was there another, subsequent Broadway production of “Arcadia” that Google has memory-holed? But no—I distinctly remember us being interested in seeing </p>...</source>
