For example, according to his data, 50% of the difference in IQ scores between people can be accounted for by genetic differences. </p><p>However, Plomin’s discussion on what this means for our society’s view on equality left a bad taste in my mouth. For example, here is what Plomin says about the implication of genetics research on equal opportunity (emphasis my own): </p><blockquote><p><strong>What look like systematic environmental effects in fact reflect genetic differences.</strong> For example, the socioeconomic status of parents is correlated with their children’s educational and occupational outcomes. This correlation has been interpreted as if it is caused environmentally. That is, better‐educated, wealthier parents are assumed to pass on privilege, creating environmentally driven inequality in educational opportunity and stifling what is called intergenerational educational mobility.</p><p><br>Genetics turns the interpretation of this correlation upside down. Socioeconomic status of parents is a measure of their educational and occupational outcomes, which are both substantially heritable. <strong>This means that the correlation between parents’ socioeconomic status and their children’s outcomes is actually about parent–offspring resemblance in education and occupation.</strong> Phrased as “parent-offspring resemblance,” it should come as no surprise that genetics largely mediates the correlation. Parent-offspring resemblance is an index of heritability, and heritability is an index of equal opportunity. <strong>So, parent-offspring resemblance for education and occupation indicates social mobility rather than social inertia.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Plomin calls heritability an “index of equal opportunity” which is to say that disparity can be justified as long as the difference is due to genetics and our “non-shared” environment<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> (see footnote for definition). </p><p>For those of us that care about creating a just and equal society, we are left with our hands-tied—what can be done? Should those that lose the genetic draw simply be left behind? </p><p>It’s also true that genetic differences between people have been used to justify the most heinous and evil crimes in human history so I tread carefully when I think about genetic difference and what it means for all </p>...</source>
