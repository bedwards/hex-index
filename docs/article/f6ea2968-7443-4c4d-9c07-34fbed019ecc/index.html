        <p class="topic-summary">The article draws a direct parallel between the 1938 Nazi pogrom and current US deportation policies. Understanding the full historical context of Kristallnacht—the planning, execution, and its role in escalating Nazi persecution—provides essential background for evaluating the author&#039;s comparison.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on Grynszpan&#039;s story as a historical parallel to the recent shooting. His full biography—the deportation of his family, his act of violence, and the Nazi exploitation of it—is crucial context that most readers won&#039;t know in detail.</p>

        <p>In certain ways, the autumn of 2025 in the United States has recalled the autumn of 1938 in Nazi Germany. </p><p>The mass deportation of undocumented people was one of Hitler’s largest coercive policies before the war. That fall, the German police and SS rounded up Jews who lacked German citizenship and dumped them on the Polish side of the German-Polish border. This set off a chain of events which can give us a useful perspective on where we are now. A family was deported; a provoked refugee took revenge; the government organized a pogrom and re-organized its police; the Second World War followed.</p><p>The family was the Grynszpans. The father and mother had moved to Germany in 1911 from the Russian Empire. Their children were born in Germany, spoke German, and saw themselves as Germans. The Grynszpans had sent their son Herschel to study in Paris. He faced a series of disappointments in his documentation, including the loss of his citizenship.  Denied permanent residence in France in August 1938, he was hiding in an attic to avoid deportation when a postcard from his sister arrived: “everything is finished for us.” Herschel Grynszpan took revenge. On November 7, 1938, he walked into the German embassy in Paris and shot the diplomat Ernst vom Rath. A policy of mass deportation had led to a reaction that, although unpredictable in its details, was not surprising.</p><p>In Berlin, Nazis saw an opportunity. Joseph Goebbels invoked a conspiracy and conflated the actions of one person with the responsibility of a group.</p><p>Hitler allowed Goebbels to plan a nationwide pogrom: <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-history-of-the-holocaust/kristallnacht/CE3B6322B82175784BF0D499F0B16E73">Kristallnacht</a>. On November 9, 1938, the SA and the SS and the Hitler youth, joined by many other Germans,<strong> </strong>destroyed Jewish businesses, burned Jewish books, desecrated Torah scrolls, and invaded Jewish homes. Some 91 Jews were killed and hundreds died by suicide. Tens of thousands of Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.</p><p>Nine decades later, no one could know in advance the details of what would happen when the Trump administration made the deportation of the undocumented its basic policy, and deploy the National Guard into Los Angeles and Washington DC, adding the provocation that such places should be seen as “training grounds for our military” and “war zones.” </p><p>But it was predictable that there would be some consequence, and now two national guard troops patrolling in Washington have been tragically shot; one has ...</p>
