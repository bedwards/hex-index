        <p><a href="https://jamesyu.substack.com/">This story was written by James Yu.</a></p><p>At noon sharp, Paz watched as the bailiffs wheeled the Host into the chamber, the red skull mark still fresh on his Adam’s apple. Even though he knew that the Host was the next to be executed, it was still shocking to see him—such a powerful personality—splayed out and vulnerable on the alloy slab.</p><p>It would be standard procedure; Paz would merely be fulfilling his duty as Assessor.</p><p>His conch piercing was unusually quiet. The silver bead vibrated the voices of the River straight into his eardrum. The city was holding its breath, watching him perform the ceremony. It was rare for the damned to be so well known.</p><p>Paz dipped a cotton swab as the Host’s eyes fluttered open.

Even now, I am listening to the River—every citizen’s voice layered into a singular stream. Cacophony to an untrained ear, but not to me. Not after decades of listening. The voices arranged into a symphony: middle notes singing the majority anthem; the treble twittering the minority opposition; and the bass chanting the undecided.” He tapped his ear. “This task cannot be entrusted to just anyone, let alone a machine. You of all people should know how it works.”</p><p>“I just wanted to hear you say it out loud,” the Host said dismissively. “Because the River has chosen wrong.”</p><p>“The River does not make mistakes.”</p><p>“But you make mistakes.”</p><p>Paz knew this might happen—that he would ...</p>
