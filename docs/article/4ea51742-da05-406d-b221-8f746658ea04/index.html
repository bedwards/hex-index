Do we want to relax? Play? Learn a new skill? Spend time together? Travel? You can even make a “Summer Bucket List” of simple activities, like going for a bike ride, sampling all your local ice cream shops, brainstorming names for the new baby, etc.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p><em>Then</em> think about where screens do and do not fit in.</p><h3><strong>2.
