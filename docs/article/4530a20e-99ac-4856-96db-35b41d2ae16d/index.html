        <p>Hi friends,</p><p>I loved this New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/books/man-died-book-list-thousands.html">story</a> about a family that shared the list of nearly 3,600 books their dad, Dan Pelzer, read during his life. As a tribute to Dan, they set up what-dan-read.com, so we can all scroll his handwritten reading logs, dating back to 1962.</p><p>When I die, please feel free to share my annual Google sheets of the books I read in a year.</p><p>In other news, I recently met a few of you at my cousin’s wedding. It was so nice to chat (and congrats to the bride and groom!)!</p><p>And, now, what to read if…</p><h1><strong>You Want a Book that Screams “Summer”</strong></h1><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9781668074800">Beach House Rules by Kristy Woodson Harvey</a></h3><p>A friend who’s a huge Elin Hilderbrand fan (or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/books/elin-hilderbrand-bucket-list-weekend.html">Hilderbabe</a>, if you will) recently asked me what she should read after finishing the Nantucket writer’s backlist. I had the perfect answer: Kristy Woodson Harvey’s <em>Beach House Rules, </em>a feel-good novel about rebuilding a life after it gets turned upside down.</p><p>When Charlotte Sitterly’s husband is arrested for a white-collar crime, she’s locked out of her house by the FBI and becomes the “star” of @JuniperShoresSocialite, her small town’s snarky gossip Instagram account. With no other options, Charlotte tepidly agrees to move into a “mommune,” a former beachfront bed-and-breakfast that’s home to a community of single mothers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg" width="415" height="627.8357142857143" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2118,&quot;width&quot;:1400,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:415,&quot;bytes&quot;:272934,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Beach House Rules by Kristy Woodson Harvey&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://whattoreadif.substack.com/i/169399475?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Beach House Rules by Kristy Woodson Harvey" title="Beach House Rules by Kristy Woodson Harvey" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!kUuG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F340776c5-663f-45ea-af8b-f2161edcfb65_1400x2118.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Charlotte and her daughter are surprised by how much they enjoy life in the mommune — and even more shocked to learn all the women who live there share a secret that threatens to break apart the community they’ve built.</p><p><em>Beach House Rules </em>is the perfect mix of light mystery — as Charlotte tries to clear her husband’s name — small-town drama and women helping each other grow. I was lucky enough to meet Woodson Harvey and tour her hometown when I joined the North Carolina Tourism Bureau for a <a href="https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/north-carolina/experiences/news/visiting-beaufort-at-christmas-is-like-living-in-a-hallmark-movie">literary tour of the state</a>. She clearly loves small-town, coastal North Carolina, and that enthusiasm jumps off the page.</p><h1><strong>You Want a Break from the Heat</strong></h1><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9780593549780">There Should Have Been Eight by Nalini Singh</a></h3><p>If you want a book with an icy, winter feel — rather than Woodson Harvey’s warm beachiness — check out <em>There Should Have Been Eight, </em>a thriller from Nalini Singh.</p><p>As the book opens, Luna, a photographer slowly — and secretly — losing her sight, is apprehensive about her planned weekend </p>...</source>
