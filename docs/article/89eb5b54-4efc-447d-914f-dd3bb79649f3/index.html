        <img src="https://www.austinpolitics.net/content/images/2025/11/IMG_3936.jpg" alt="An outside audit? Meh."><p>Just a day after <a href="https://www.austinpolitics.net/whats-next-for-mackowiak/" rel="noreferrer">wondering</a> what would come next for referendum entrepreneur Matt Mackowiak, I saw Save Austin Now hype an upcoming "major announcement" Friday morning. I initially made the mistake of believing it would actually be a major announcement. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.austinpolitics.net/content/images/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-24-at-10.29.44---AM.png" class="kg-image" alt="An outside audit?

The Charter amendment explicitly requires that the&nbsp;Independent Contractor commit to identify annual or multi-year cost savings that exceed the cost of the initiative.</blockquote><blockquote>This effort is modeled after a successful external audit conducted by the City of Houston this year which identified more than $120M in suggested savings and helped Houston avoid a tax rate election, unlike Austin.</blockquote><p>You can read the petition on <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6029b033d6914a529eedb8b9/t/691feeec9f17e963e3cc995f/1763700460163/PETITION-112125-Independent-Affordability-and-Efficiency-Audit.pdf?ref=austinpolitics.net" rel="noreferrer">Save Austin Now's website</a>. </p><p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but nor is it a game-changer. </p>
