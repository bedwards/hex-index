      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Hello. After some heavy lifting on <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/jonathanrowson/p/the-threeness-of-the-world-66?r=1686d&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">the threeness of the world</a>, and a <a href="https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-cops-and-their-cars">long-form reflection on climate change</a> for Perspectiva earlier this week, I wanted to share something gentler and shorter about a micro story that’s been coming to mind. The vignette is adapted from the book, <em>Soul Food</em> by Kornfield and Feldman (1996, p124).<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><blockquote><p><em><strong>The Nun’s Question. </strong></em></p><p><em>There’s a nun who will never give you advice, but only a question. I was told her questions could be very helpful. I sought her out.</em></p><p><em>‘I am a parish priest,’ I said. ‘I’m here on retreat. Could you give me a question?’ ‘Ah yes,’ she answered. ‘My question is, “What do they need?”’</em></p><p><em>To tell the truth, I came away disappointed. I spent a few hours with the question, writing out answers, but finally I went back to her.</em></p><p><em>‘Excuse me,’ I said. ‘Perhaps I didn’t make myself clear. Your question has been helpful, but I wasn’t so much interested in thinking about my congregation during this retreat. Rather I wanted to think seriously about my own spiritual life. Could you give me a question that will help?’</em></p><p><em>‘Ah, I see,’ she said. ‘Then my question for you is, “What do they really need?”’ </em></p></blockquote><p>I have known about this vignette for twenty years and still don’t know how to feel about it. Initially I found it a bit troubling, as if the question as answer missed the point of the question as question. But it is beginning to make sense to me.</p><p>I spent the first part of my adult live travelling the world <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/happiness-chess-joy.html">playing chess</a>, and following my bliss. It was great while it lasted, but I have no wish to go back there. I am now in a phase of life where I regularly need to make myself available to colleagues, friends and particularly family in need. This pattern of responding to the needs of others often leads me to feel I need a break from responsibilities and time <em>to myself</em>, which can feel strange given the extent to which my self is constituted by and for others.</p><p>On a daily basis, I find am relieved to sit down with a coffee I have just made, or that I put my shoes on to head out for a walk, or that I am eager to go into an event in central London, only to discover ...</p>
