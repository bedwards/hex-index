A colleague in his practice group had been sought out for a job many states away. Significant increase in pay, state of the art facilities, amazing career opportunity which then gave his spouse and kids lots of increased cushion and life opportunities. Of course, after multiple interviews, going out to visit and house hunting with the agent the organization paired him with they decided it was too great to pass up, despite being bummed to leave their home and network here.</p><p><em>So what went wrong?</em></p><p>Well, the job was everything that was promised. He loved it. He spent a lot of time working, so the move wasn’t too rough for him.

They moved from semi-urban living, tons of kids in the neighborhood, great public schools that most people attend, parks/restaurants in every direction - walkable everywhere. Close airport, downtown, tons of activities, easy commute, lots of access to dad even with his busy schedule. </p><h2>Despite the increased pay and great job - they lost nearly everything they loved about their life with this move.</h2><p>They lived further outside the city, went to private school because the public schools weren’t what they hoped for, the community aspect was lacking, they had to drive in a car 20-30 minutes to do nearly everything, and zero walkability. They traded an idyllic life (where they still had plenty of resources) for one that was isolated and lonely. </p><p>When they called me, we talked through all the details. </p><h2>I tell people - don’t just give me the house stats you want - give me your LIFE stats. What are your priorities in where/how you want to live? Can </h2>...</source>
