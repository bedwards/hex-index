Sir Gilthwaite hails him with a raised, mailed fist, his other hand clutching the leg of a roast grouse. Sir Bryllwyn, the senior member of the order, a pockmarked, red-bearded giant of a man who lost his left ear in close combat with a Moor, stands from his chair and roars at him in greeting, his words indistinct, as he also lost his tongue.

He finds himself seated in a small office decorated with stubby desert plants and color photos of Olympic athletes, both on the stand wearing medals and in action, kicking balls and grappling on mats. Across for him, on a backless stool with casters, a slim young fellow in a loose grey jacket with a pocket ID badge that read “Russ” is already speaking to him about his future.</p><p>“The good news, before we preview the conditions of our changed society,” says Russ, who is </p>...</source>
