        <p>A little bit more about my forthcoming book <em>Finding Lights in a Dark Age</em> and related things.</p><p>So, the book has a UK publication date of 14 October and a US publication date of November 11. Preorder links are <a href="https://www.rizzoliusa.com/buy-online/9781915294739/">here</a>. If you’re planning to buy it, please also consider supporting your local bookshop/bookstore (I’m working on the copyedit at the moment – I’m shocked at how confusedly mid-Atlantic my English has become).</p><p>Talking of working on the copyedit, my summer seems to be evaporating before it’s even started in a welter of editing and writing work, speaking events and farm projects so I’m afraid new web content from me here may be a bit sparse over the next few months. Please bear with me. I’m keen to keep writing online and I always like to see the discussions under my posts.</p><p>I’ve got a few things I’m hoping to write about, and then in the autumn I’ll start a brief-ish blog cycle about the new book. Perhaps I’ll list here the things I want to write about in my next few posts to act as a teaser, and to help focus my mind on getting them written –</p><ul><li><p>A post engaging with a new initiative, the Root and Branch Collective, discussed <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-162958328">here</a> and <a href="https://rootbranchcollective.cargo.site/our-commitments">here</a>, which I find thought-provoking in relation to its overlaps and tensions with the case for agrarian localism and the broadly distributist, civic republican and agrarian populist politics I advocate for.</p></li><li><p>A post discussing the idea of overshoot. By which I really do mean overshoot <a href="https://chrissmaje.com/2025/03/overshoot-meet-undershoot/">this time</a> – i.e. the relationship of human populations to a renewable ecological base.</p></li><li><p>A post picking up on recent discussions here about religion and spirituality as the gods of secular modernity approach their date with Ragnarök.</p></li><li><p>A post on the concept of the professional-managerial class and its significance today.</p></li><li><p>A lamb’s tale, or a sheep’s tail…</p></li></ul><p>If anybody would like to suggest topics for an open comment thread of mostly reader-generated discussion, I’d also be open to that to tide things over while I attend to other things.</p><p>Incidentally, news is recently in of the death of Alasdair MacIntyre, a major influence on me in general and on my new book in particular. This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/25/alasdair-macintyre-obituary">obituary</a> in <em>The Guardian </em>probably gives some clues as to why he matters to someone like me, even if it does scold him for influencing ...</p>
