I had been substitute teaching in the district for a few months, leaving my resume and business card with office managers hoping to get a job interview for a permanent teaching assignment. It did not look promising. At the very least, I was hoping to get a long-term substitute job, so that I didn’t have to continue driving from school to school, picking up jobs from Kindergarten to high school. Substitute teaching wasn’t horrible, but it didn’t feel like I was actually teaching.

I gathered all of the things I felt belonged to this teacher, returned them to the front office, and began figuring out what I was going to teach the next day. I couldn’t find a planbook, so I relied on her teammates to help me gain my bearings. The next morning, as I greeted students, introducing myself as </p>...</source>
