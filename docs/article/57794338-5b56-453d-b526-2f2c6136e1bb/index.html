So why couldn’t liberals stop shouting “Racism!” every minute, when we as a society had already solved that problem? Can’t we just stop talking about it?</p><p>As absurd as that argument always was, what’s striking about it today is not that it imagines a post-racial future we haven’t yet reached, but that it has come to describe a Republican Party of the past. The party of today, embodied as it is in Donald Trump and the administration he leads, is no longer so worried about being called racist, because it has unashamedly taken white supremacy as its cause.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;cdfd9d10-8b31-49af-88bc-85047e424606&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Why MAGA is coming apart at the seams&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:21164210,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Paul Waldman&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Journalist, author, occasional troublemaker&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdfbfa154-bfe8-4060-9dbf-e494c4f7fef0_2055x2052.png&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:100}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2025-11-28T11:17:32.988Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3uob!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01001a4b-ddf4-4927-8429-fb9a7598c50c_7121x4905.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.publicnotice.co/p/post-trump-gop-marjorie-taylor-greene&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;video_upload_id&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:179850947,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:925,&quot;comment_count&quot;:36,&quot;publication_id&quot;:501423,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Public Notice&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!d7xc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27a23854-104e-4c0d-8b6e-68b082c65a5b_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}"></div><p>In some cases, that has meant putting into action what Trump only talked about in his first term. In others, it has meant exploring entirely new frontiers of racism and xenophobia, of a kind we thought we left behind decades ago.</p><p>This appears to be an attempt to prove that the arc of history does not bend in one direction, but can double back and reverse course. Just a few years ago, conservatives struggled to navigate a world in which everyone was expected to pay fealty (whether sincerely or not) to the idea that the United States could be a multi-racial democracy in which equality was the goal toward which we all strove.
