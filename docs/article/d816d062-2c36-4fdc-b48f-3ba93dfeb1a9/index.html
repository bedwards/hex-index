        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Trump&#039;s tariff policies and their economic effects. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 is the most famous example of protectionist tariffs backfiring, deepening the Great Depression and triggering retaliatory tariffs worldwide - essential historical context for understanding modern tariff debates.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article draws explicit parallels between the current AI boom and past technology investment manias, noting that railroads and telecoms &#039;experienced busts along the way&#039; despite being transformative. The dot-com bubble provides the most relevant recent precedent for understanding how transformative technology can still produce financial carnage.</p>

So every Thanksgiving or thereabouts, I do a roundup of seven important themes from the past year, along with a few themes to watch for in the upcoming year. Here’s <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/four-years-of-noahpinion">last year’s edition</a>. The links below are all links to other posts I wrote over the past 12 months, so you can use this post as a reference for what I wrote about in 2025.</p><p>I’d also like to thank everyone for reading and supporting Noahpinion. A year ago this blog had 280,000 readers; now it has 414,000. I never expected my blog to get that big, and I’m incredibly grateful to all of you for helping to make that happen. Please remember to recommend Noahpinion to your friends, family, and coworkers! I also <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/i-have-written-a-book">published a book this past year</a>, though so far it’s only in Japanese; this upcoming year I’m going to write an English-language book about macroeconomics, so be on the lookout for that.</p><p>Anyway, here are the seven themes for 2025.</p><h4>Tariff madness</h4><p>This was the year that Donald Trump, true to his campaign promises, upended 70 years of American economic policy. On April 2, which he dubbed “Liberation Day”, Trump <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/tariffs-another-american-act-of-intentional">announced truly enormous tariffs</a> on almost all of the countries in the world. Many of these tariffs were eventually <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/even-if-trump-chickens-out-you-should">walked back</a>, sometimes after “deals” in which other countries made various promises to the U.S. and/or to Trump and his family. Thankfully, none of <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/worst-case-scenarios-and-endgames">the worst-case scenarios</a> have yet reared their heads. </p><p>But some tariffs remained in place, and these tended to be <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/trump-starts-to-break-things">tariffs on America’s allies</a> rather than on China. And general uncertainty about future tariffs has exploded. This, along with worries about U.S. political unrest and national debt, has led to <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/this-is-called-capital-flight">a depreciation of the dollar</a> as some investors hedged their bets by moving money out of the country. </p><p>The tariffs haven’t yet tanked the economy or <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/why-tariffs-havent-raised-inflation">raised inflation</a>, but they’re exerting <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/america-is-getting-the-economy-we">a corrosive influence on the economy</a>, pushing up prices, weighing on employment, and <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-pundits-dilemma">hurting the manufacturing sector</a>. This was entirely predictable; <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-economics-theory-that-could-have">economists have long understood</a> that tariffs on intermediate goods <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/there-is-no-utopia-waiting-on-the">hurt manufacturing</a> by disrupting and shrinking supply chains. Trump’s team, unfortunately, makes it a point of pride not to listen to economists, instead choosing to invent <a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/all-the-arguments-for-tariffs-are">a blizzard of </a></p>...</source>
