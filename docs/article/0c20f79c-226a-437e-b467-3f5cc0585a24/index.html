Another year is at an end and it is remarkable to think that time has gone by so quickly.</p><p>I have done a recap video for the past two years. Let's do it again. </p><p>In today's video, I want to reflect on 2024 and the state of the channel. I am still actually working, haha. But a few minutes to reflect. </p><h2>Year Recap. My favorites. </h2><p>I have personal favorites this year that I want to share with you. Let us begin with that. </p><div id="youtube2-YR9bwoS6Bgs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;YR9bwoS6Bgs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YR9bwoS6Bgs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>My favorite video to make in 2024 was that of the Nisei interpreters during World War II. Their plight of navigating two different cultures strikes a chord with me. And their stories of heroism - particularly the story of Terry Doi at Iwo Jima - will always stick with me. </p><div id="youtube2-Wu3FnasuE2s" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Wu3FnasuE2s&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wu3FnasuE2s?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Second is the story of Texas Instruments. It has it all. The integrated circuit, silicon transistors, Morris Chang and a disastrous foray into retail. I find myself going back to a few stories and re-reading them for enjoyment. This one I come back to a lot. </p><p>Third is the story of Ei-Nis, the semiconductor maker in Serbia. Augmented with thoughts and image records from the son of a former worker there, I found it extraordinary insight into the Yugoslavian economy. </p><div id="youtube2-uE_Qnsh1_2A" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;uE_Qnsh1_2A&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uE_Qnsh1_2A?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Fourth is my video about how a CVD diamond is made. I came across the company during a visit to a startup fair in Taipei. I asked if they’d be interested to letting me do a video about them and amazingly enough they were. And that is how I found myself in a small village outside Taichung, handling diamonds that might cost tens of thousands of dollars on the market. Lab diamonds are the future. Enough said. </p><div id="youtube2-L8jmHtfVmPY" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;L8jmHtfVmPY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L8jmHtfVmPY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Fifth is my video on RF filters. A miraculous piece of technology that helped create the AI giant now known as Avago/Broadcom. I want to thank the anonymous viewer in Denver who spent the time to walk me through it in a call. </p><h2>Workflows </h2><p>In recent videos, I have been augmenting the research with conversations with key people. These might be experts in a field, researchers talking about their life's work, or participants in a historical event. </p><p>Perhaps one small advantage of being more well known is that people recognize who you are, and thus are more willing to speak with you. I am appreciative of ...</p>
