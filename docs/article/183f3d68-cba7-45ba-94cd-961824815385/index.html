However, they have also sparked concerns about how this technology is being directed. From the perspective of digital leftism, AI can be a revolutionary tool that contributes to restructuring society toward greater justice and equality.</p><p>This vision aims to liberate AI from the constraints of the capitalist market and redirect it toward serving all humanity, transforming it into a means to improve quality of life, free people from burdensome routine labor, and enhance human creativity in all areas.</p><p>For the first time in history, it has become realistically possible to meet the needs of the majority of the population with minimal human effort, and to provide goods, services, and knowledge abundantly, sometimes even for free, without relying on intensive wage labor or traditional bureaucratic structures. However, these possibilities are being constrained and used to maximize profits, reduce wages, and deepen class and ideological domination, rather than to free people from exploitation.</p><p>Today, AI is not merely a new tool in the hands of capital, it is fundamentally a reflection of a qualitative transformation in the nature of production and an exposure of capitalism’s structural limits. Many digital applications and platforms, from 3D printing to cooperative systems, home-based production, mass automation, and the removal of capitalist intermediaries in some sectors, demonstrate that society now effectively possesses the tools that could allow for a socialist reorganization of the economy in a horizontal, participatory, and community-based manner.</p><p>Yet this transformation remains constrained and stifled by the monopolistic structures that dominate technology and redirect it toward profit rather than social benefit.</p><p>In the following sections, we will explore how a socialist, leftist vision, particularly that of electronic leftism, can redefine artificial intelligence as a liberating force serving human and progressive values. These ideas, however, are merely an outline for collective dialogue within the left. Proposing such an alternative requires broad discussion among leftist, progressive, and activist movements and individuals around the world. By presenting these ideas, the goal is not to offer ready-made solutions, but to open up debate about urgent priorities. These priorities should serve as an open invitation to contribute to developing a digital leftist vision based on the collective ownership of artificial intelligence specifically, </p>...</source>
