        <p>Yesterday, Friday 21 November, ended up being one kind of day but it was supposed to be another. <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/phillipspobrien/p/the-new-us-sanctions-move-actually?r=1tgexa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">21 November, in case you had forgotten, was supposed to be the day that the Trump Administration levelled crippling secondary sanctions on Chinese, Indian and Turkish companies that buy Russian oil</a>. Indeed, the Treasury Department even hinted earlier this week that those secondary were ready to go. It capped off six weeks of a frenzy of reporting about how Trump was going to really hit Putin hard. Piles of articles (many of which had a fundamentally flawed understanding of the oil markets) were written about how Trump’s sanctions were real this time. <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/a-trump-peace-plan-for-russia-ukraine-or-phantom-skepticism?r=1tgexa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">Even </a><em><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/a-trump-peace-plan-for-russia-ukraine-or-phantom-skepticism?r=1tgexa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">The Bulwark</a></em><a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/a-trump-peace-plan-for-russia-ukraine-or-phantom-skepticism?r=1tgexa&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false">, fell for this con, and we saw a hopelessly naive article by Cathy Young about how Trump really was going to hurt Putin this time</a>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg" width="864" height="486" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:486,&quot;width&quot;:864,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;READ - Full transcript of heated exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy, Vance at Oval Office&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="READ - Full transcript of heated exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy, Vance at Oval Office" title="READ - Full transcript of heated exchange between Trump, Zelenskyy, Vance at Oval Office" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1kGs!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0701bfff-a942-4f3d-b9de-e0b5d22007f0_864x486.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">What happened yesterday was we returned to reality—this.

Now, Chinese, Indian and Turkish oil companies can get back to business buying as much Russian oil as they want/can. Soon Russia will be making more than they were.</p><p><em>btw, the Chinese probably never stopped buying Russian oil, but that is a piece for another day.</em></p><p>Instead, what actually happened on November 21 was that the Trump Administration came for Ukraine—as they always intended to do. The Secretary of the Army, Dan Driscoll, a very close associate of VP JD Vance, went to Kyiv and tried to bully the Ukrainians <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/">into accepting Trump’s 28 Point Plan to neuter Ukraine</a>. Driscoll formally presented the plan to divide Ukraine now, and end it later, and the reality of what Ukraine and Europe was facing finally sunk in. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2025/11/dmz-ukraine-russia-trump-korea/685020/">Here was how the Atlantic story on the meeting began.</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png" width="1080" height="518" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:518,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:93888,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/i/179633947?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!dK9t!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3662054f-88a0-4f6d-ae37-58f6a43b4be6_1080x518.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The most depressing thing from the above story was that the diplomat was surprised at what the administration was doing; or I should say that the unnamed diplomat had fallen for the Trump Administration’s long con.
