        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Yang Meng&#039;s doctoral research on Shanghai&#039;s WWII Jewish emigré community. The Shanghai Ghetto housed approximately 20,000 Jewish refugees who fled Nazi persecution, representing a unique chapter in both Jewish and Chinese history that provides essential context for understanding historical Jewish-Chinese relations.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Xi Jinping pressuring Trump regarding Taiwan and Japan&#039;s potential military response to a Chinese attack. Understanding the diplomatic framework of the One-China policy—its origins, variations between countries, and strategic ambiguities—is crucial for readers to grasp the stakes of these conversations.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">A central figure in the article&#039;s discussion of Japan-China-US relations, Takaichi&#039;s comments on Taiwan defense angered Beijing. Her political background as a conservative nationalist and her positions on historical revisionism provide important context for understanding why her statements carry particular weight in the region.</p>

She learned the language while researching her doctoral thesis on Shanghai’s World War II emigré Jewish community. </p><p>I’ve been corresponding with her occasionally over the last few years, as she has faced a growing wave of antisemitism in China, and even institutional difficulties with her work.

When I was learning to speak Chinese in the 1990s, primarily by chatting to drunken strangers in small Beijing corner restaurants, I heard admiration expressed  several times for Hitler as a “strong” leader, but that was often followed up with many complimentary statements </p>...</source>
