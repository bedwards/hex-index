The other idea I find myself thinking about a lot these days is how <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/147/6/e2020049823">teens are exploring gender</a>. Many of my own teenager’s friends are identifying as nonbinary (as they/them) and I’m wondering why this is becoming so common versus when I was an adolescent. What is driving this? In my limited experience, it appears that many of the kids are rejecting our society’s binary, gendered norms. I was taught, as a young girl, that girls could do or be anything, just as boys could. For this generation of teens, that seems to be shifting. Gender is both fluid for some kids and irrelevant for others. What is at the heart of this wave of questioning? And how can we parent our teens through this somewhat uncharted territory?</p><p>For this article I would talk to developmental psychologists, gender experts, and people in the trans community for their perspectives. I think many parents may be facing this new territory and wondering how to support their children as they evolve.</p><p>Thank you so much for considering these ideas,</p><p>XXX</p><p>___</p><p>On Wed, Oct 19, 2022 at 11:55 AM - XXX wrote:</p><p>Subject: Huge increase in top surgery for trans youth and majority are white adolescent girls -JAMA Pediatrics</p><p>Hi XXX,</p><p>Just wondering if you’ve seen this new study (attached).
