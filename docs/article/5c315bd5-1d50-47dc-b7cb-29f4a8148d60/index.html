(Justin Tang/Canadian Press)</em></p><p><em><strong>This story was originally published on <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/">thewalrus.ca</a></strong></em></p><p><strong>By <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/author/alex-marland/">Alex Marland</a>, <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/author/jared-j-wesley/">Jared J. Wesley</a>, and <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/author/mireille-lalancette/">Mireille Lalancette</a></strong></p><p><strong>In the 2015</strong> Alberta election, Sandra Jansen was one of just nine Progressive Conservative candidates elected and the only woman in that caucus. She subsequently withdrew from seeking the party leadership and crossed the floor to the arch-rival New Democrats after an inspiring conversation with Rachel Notley. The NDP’s newest backbencher received a standing ovation in the legislature when she read aloud some of the misogynistic messages directed at her and then premier Notley on social media.</p><p>Jansen opened a member’s statement as follows: “‘What a traitorous bitch.’ ‘You both are a disgrace to Alberta, lying bitches.’ ‘Now you have two blonde bimbos in that party that are clueless.’ ‘Another useless tit goes NDP.’ ‘Dead meat.’ ‘Sandra should stay in the kitchen where she belongs.’ ‘Fly with the crows [and] get shot.’ ‘Dumb broad. A good place for her to be is with the rest of the queers.’” Jansen was temporarily assigned a security detail to ensure her personal safety, but widespread criticism over the cost of the protection officer led her to cancel the arrangement after just a few days. Although she was appointed to cabinet a year later, the blowback from crossing the floor factored heavily in her decision not to seek re-election.</p><p>Partisans have a fierce reaction to parliamentarians who betray their cause and bring ignominy upon the group. Given the deep-rooted party loyalties in Canada, it is no surprise that many voters feel betrayed when their elected representative unilaterally switches parties between elections, and that rejected partisans pile on criticism to make a perceived traitor’s life miserable.</p><p>There is the practical side of changing jobs, such as lack of familiarity with the new organization’s customs and workplace culture and not knowing who people are. There is the added dimension of needing to build trust with suspicious colleagues, most of whom, until recently, were adversaries, both within a caucus and an electoral district association. There are also the opinions of constituents to manage and a need to court their vote. And there is sexism.</p><p>A political staffer who has negotiated some prominent switches summarizes the hazards: “Don’t underestimate how hard it’s going to be </p>...</source>
