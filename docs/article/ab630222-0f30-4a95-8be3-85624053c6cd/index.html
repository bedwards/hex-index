        <p>The shutdown may finally be coming to an end. Our health care costs, unfortunately, will not. I’ll be back on Wednesday with a deep dive into just how spectacularly absurd our health care system has become.</p><p>In the meantime, RSV and flu are picking up speed, and a concerning infant formula recall has been linked to a rare botulism cluster, thanks to a small but mighty team in California. The FDA is expected to remove the black box warning from hormone replacement therapy—a move that’s scientifically sound but bound to spark drama from HHS. We also have new blood pressure guidelines that could make prevention a lot more personal. And amidst it all, a few more pieces of genuinely good news to end on a high note.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><div><hr></div><h3>Disease “weather” report: RSV and flu gaining momentum</h3><p>It will take some time for the CDC data systems to ramp up again after being offline for over 40 days. For now, we’ll continue to rely on the alternative sources, such as Dr. Caitlin Rivers’ updates and the <a href="https://www.pophive.org/">PopHive</a> dashboards.</p><p><em><strong>RSV</strong></em> continues to climb slowly but steadily, especially among children under five.

Our deadliest flu season came at a time of historically low vaccination rates, which can’t be a coincidence.
