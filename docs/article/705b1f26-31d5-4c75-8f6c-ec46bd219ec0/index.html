        <p>For the last year, one of the most persistent narratives in tech has been that <strong>generative AI will make Google Search obsolete.</strong></p><p>After all, if an AI can answer your question directly, why click on a link? And if nobody clicks, Google’s ad business collapses. Right?</p><p>But Google’s earnings tell a different story. Revenue is up. Search is up. GenAI features are <em>additive</em> to usage and revenue.</p><p>So what’s really going on?</p><h2>Google’s Core Business</h2><p>To answer that, it helps to step back and look at what Google actually is. The company can be thought of as operating three distinct business:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Information</strong> (Search and other apps, monetized primarily through advertising)</p></li><li><p><strong>Entertainment</strong> (YouTube, also ad‑driven but with subscriptions too)</p></li><li><p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong> </p></li></ul><p>A fourth is emerging too:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transportation</strong> (Waymo, a bet on the future)</p></li></ul><p>Let’s focus on the information business, and specifically on search — Google’s oldest and most profitable segment, and the one most often assumed to be in existential danger from GenAI.</p><h3>JTBD</h3><p><strong>The job-to-be-done is simple: answer my question.</strong> </p><p>The user asks a question, Google delivers the best answer, and advertisers pay to appear alongside those answers.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png" width="1456" height="622" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:622,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uhy1!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ea1a587-4f85-49e5-8246-02e2d0493f07_1600x684.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A simple framework for understanding Google’s information business, its stakeholders, and the core job-to-be-done</figcaption></figure></div><p>Historically, this answer took the form of “10 blue links”, with ads sold for the most prominent spots. </p><p><strong>The “GenAI ends Search” narrative assumes that generative answers replace the 10 blue links with a static box of text — </strong>something like a ChatGPT answer that eliminates the ads and often all links. </p><p>But that assumption jumps straight to a solution without first discussing the problem. What <em>problem</em> is Search solving for its stakeholders, and how can GenAI help solve it better? Are we sure that ChatGPT answers are the best UX for all stakeholders?</p><p>Let’s start with Google’s pre-Generative AI solution first. This search experience has friction for users, advertisers, and Google itself. </p><p>GenAI makes the experience much better, all around. </p><h2>Friction Within Google’s Current UX</h2><p>For users, the pain often starts with intent. <strong>Does Google understand what you are asking for?</strong> </p><p>Paradoxically, the longer and more detailed the search prompt, the worse the results often get because more keywords match more content. That is the opposite of what you would expect! <em>More context should help Google better understand your intent, right?</em></p><p><a href="https://serpzilla.com/blog/advanced-google-search-operators/">Search operators</a> were introduced to bridge this gap, but they are a clunky workaround from computer </p>...</source>
