Wander on December 2, 2025.</p><p>Lawyers for the self-declared “Epstein Survivors” are in a bit of a panic right now, overcome with non-specific “fears” — which they attribute to their allegedly fearful clients — that excessive transparency and disclosure could soon be forthcoming in relation to the so-called “Epstein Files.” I addressed these purported fears in a <a href="https://www.mtracey.net/p/my-letter-to-judge-berman">letter last week</a> to Judge Richard M. Berman, to whom the lawyers have directed many of their overwrought complaints. (Somewhat surprisingly, Judge Berman emailed me back almost immediately after the letter was sent on Friday evening, saying he would “perhaps” include my letter in the official court docket. Whether he will ultimately include the letter is unknown, but he at least appeared to read it, and gave it enough consideration to write back that he will “perhaps” add it to the docket, after talking it over with colleagues and/or staff.)</p><p>The principal issue at present is the 30-day statutory deadline for the release of the “Epstein Files,” which is fast approaching on December 19, 2025. You’d think this would be a joyous occasion for the lawyers and their clients, seeing as they’ve been so loudly clamoring for the urgent release of any and all “Epstein Files.” Finally, you’d think, these righteous lawyers would have achieved their long-sought legislative solution. But you’d be wrong.</p><p>Instead, just before Thanksgiving, the newlywed legal juggernaut of Bradley Edwards and Brittany Henderson sent an exasperated <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649/gov.uscourts.nysd.518649.87.0.pdf">letter</a> to Judge Berman, fulminating that it was <strong>absolutely unacceptable </strong>(bolded and underlined for maximum indignation) that certain records were already being released by the House Oversight Committee, which in their judgment provided utterly intolerable levels of information to the public. (Weirdly, Substack does not allow you to easily underline text in its word processing system, so you’ll just have to use your imagination as to how they formatted their letter, unless you want to click through and read it directly.) Edwards and Henderson further demanded that Judge Berman order the Department of Justice to “consult” with them personally, so that they’d have what would amount to <em>de facto</em> veto power over the release of forthcoming records pursuant to the <em>Epstein Files Transparency Act</em>.</p><p>Nowhere was it mentioned </p>...</source>
