        <p>Welcome to the inaugural post of my <strong>'Health 3.0 - Longevity Basics' </strong>series. Periodically, I'll offer actionable and practical guidance on aligning our daily routines with the principles of longevity and optimal health, grounded in current scientific understanding.</p><p>Today, we delve into the vast realm of supplements. While the world of supplements can be overwhelming, a new category has recently emerged, specifically targeting longevity. There isn’t one magic anti-aging compound (or even several), but a limited but growing number of studies suggest that certain supplements might help to “reverse” epigenetic aging, or preserve the 12 biological processes associated with aging, referred to as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867422013770">12 Hallmarks of Aging.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I'll share insights I gathered from looking at recommendations by industry leaders and experts in longevity and functional health. Additionally, I'll delve into the science backing these 'longevity supplements' – ones that I personally incorporate into my daily routine. I hope you find this helpful.</p><h1> <br>The Players</h1><p>Since people have been practicing medicine, the holy grail for human health has been to slow or stop aging.
