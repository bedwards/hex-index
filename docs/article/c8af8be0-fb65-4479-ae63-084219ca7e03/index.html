        <p>A short newsletter. Two suggested articles and a long paper up top: The Economist recently released “<em>Why is Xi Jinping building secret commodity stockpiles</em>?” <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/07/23/why-is-xi-jinping-building-secret-commodity-stockpiles">The article</a> is very much worth your time, although it’s worth noting the difficulties of accurately measuring China’s crude oil stocks: different analysts arrive at different figures. Additionally, I’ve written “<em>China’s high-stakes diplomacy: Managing Middle Eastern turmoil</em>” for The Lowy Institute. <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/china-s-high-stakes-diplomacy-managing-middle-eastern-turmoil">The piece</a> examines how the crisis could impact Chinese interests largely by applying an economic/energy lens. I’ve also included a chart below that was cut in the interests of time.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png" width="712" height="431" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:431,&quot;width&quot;:712,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:16686,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpaU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa28442e7-c967-4cb3-b6b4-c702c90dcfaa_712x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Sources: PRC General Administration of Customs, Author’s Calculations</p><p>Finally, Gabriel Collins of Rice University and Andrew S.

Will it affect the signing of the China-mediated agreement not long ago [the Beijing Declaration]? In addition, the increasingly complex situation in the Middle East will distract or weaken China's efforts to achieve security, stability and peace in the region?</p><p>Lin Jian: China has stated its position on the relevant incident.
