Let’s get into it…</p><p>— — —</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Why are you doing this sale?</p><p>— — —</p><p>Instead of celebrating with a fancy steak dinner or anything like that, I wanted to celebrate with YOU.</p><p>The Elite Performer Retirement is a big milestone for me.</p><p>Over the last 10 months, the Elite Performers and I dug deep and pulled out a version of ourselves we’ve never met before.</p><p>I’m super proud of the work we’ve done.</p><p>Plus, these workshops are beyond valuable.</p><p>I know I constantly fall back on these systems, frameworks, and habits when the hard times come knocking…</p><p>… Because, frankly, they just work time and time again.</p><p>And the last thing I want to happen is for these assets to go to waste while we’re evolving into a new group.</p><p>So…I’m giving you a limited-time chance to pull back the curtain and see what we’ve been working on.</p><p>That’s why I’m doing this.</p><p><strong><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">&gt;&gt;&gt;Want to celebrate with me?</a></strong></p><p>— — —</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>What’s the Elite Performers Pass?</p><p>— — —</p><p>This “pass” is your key to unlock ALL of the workshops I’ve hosted for Elite Performers this year — 12 in total.</p><p>Plus…you’ll get all the plug and play templates, valuable bonuses, etc, etc.</p><p>The best part is you’re getting everything at a 25% discount.</p><p>So it’s a heck of a deal.</p><p><strong><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">&gt;&gt;&gt;Claim your Elite Performer Pass now</a></strong></p><p>— — —&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Can I buy any individual workshops, too?</p><p>— — —</p><p>Yes.</p><p>If you aren’t interested in getting all of the workshops, that’s fine.</p><p>I’ve got good news…</p><p>You can buy any single workshop you want <em>AND</em> still get the templates + bonuses that come with that specific workshop.</p><p>Make sense?</p><p>Moreover, if you’ve got your eye on a couple (or even a handful) of workshops, you can grab those too.</p><p>Simply add them to your cart, and you’ll be emailed the links.</p><p><strong><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">&gt;&gt;&gt;Want to claim your workshop(s) now?</a></strong></p><p>— — —</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Will you ever sell these again?</p><p>— — —</p><p>Look, I’ll be honest…</p><p>I have ZERO plans of bringing this back anytime soon…</p><p>… And, on the ...</p>
