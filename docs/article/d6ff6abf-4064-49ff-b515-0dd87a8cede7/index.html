        <p>I have to admit I was very surprised by the news when it came up. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/TSMC-Chairman-Mark-Liu-to-retire-next-year">Mark Liu, TSMC’s chairman</a>, is retiring. He gave a statement roughly goes something like this: </p><blockquote><p>For the past thirty years, contributing my efforts at TSMC has been an extraordinary journey for me. I am especially grateful to the company's extremely talented team. Together, we have shaped the company into today's industry benchmark. It is a great honor to take over as Chairman of TSMC after the retirement of the company's legendary founder.

The Global Financial Crisis struck, hurting the industry. Worse yet, TSMC fumbled a series of layoffs. The layoffs were deemed necessary considering the economic situation. But Taiwanese business media reported that those layoffs were implemented with insufficiently rigorous criteria. Workers who supposedly left voluntarily were protesting outside of Morris Chang's house. </p><p>TSMC met the expectations of the financial community. Nevertheless, on June 2009, just four years after the CEO handover, Morris Chang removed Tsai, reassigning him to a smaller division. Tsai is now the CEO of MediaTek. He restarted the succession process all over again, and then plunged the company into a massive capital expenditure that paved the way for Apple. </p><p>Chang did not completely retire from the company again until 2017 he was 86 years, when he brought Mark Liu and CC Wei ...</p>
