        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Wen Kang was a &#039;Manchu bannerman&#039; who wrote the novel containing the idiom. Understanding the Eight Banners system—the military and social organization of Manchu society that formed the backbone of the Qing Dynasty—provides crucial context for who the author was and the social milieu in which classical Chinese literature was produced.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The fire spread via bamboo scaffolding wrapped around the Hong Kong towers. Bamboo scaffolding is a distinctive construction practice still common in Hong Kong and southern China, with a fascinating history, cultural significance, and specific engineering properties that made it both useful and dangerous in this disaster context.</p>

The blaze swept through seven of the estate’s eight residential towers, killing at least 159 people and injuring dozens more.</p><p>The 31-storey towers had been undergoing a HK$330-million (US$42-million) renovation since July 2024, wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green safety netting.</p><p>Video footage of the fire shows flames racing up the scaffolding with incredible speed. It spread so rapidly that many elderly residents were trapped inside, unable to escape.</p><p>Within days, police had arrested a dozen people from the construction firm and management company responsible for the renovation on suspicion of gross negligence and manslaughter.</p><p>Residents say they’d been complaining about the construction company for months.</p><p>In media interviews, survivors of the disaster say they often saw construction workers smoking on site, and piles of loose (now believed to be flammable) netting were regularly left scattered across the compound. Others complained the renovation was overpriced and poorly done, using a well-known Chinese idiom <a href="https://www.realtimemandarin.com/p/253-in-the-aftermath-of-the-hong">to make their point</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>“In practice, it is not uncommon for the contractor to <strong>cut corners</strong> on fire-retardant safety nets.”</em></p><p><em>在实践中，施工方对阻燃保护网”<strong>偷工减料</strong>”的情形并不鲜见。</em></p></blockquote><p>And with that, we have our Sinica Phrase of the Week.</p><h2><strong>What it means</strong></h2><p>“Cut corners” is the English translation of a common Chinese idiom. Breaking down the characters: “to do secretly” (偷 tōu), “work” (工 gōng), “to reduce, to cut” (减 jiǎn), “materials” (料 liào).</p><p>Together, the idiom literally means “skimp on workmanship and reduce materials.”</p><p>It originally referred specifically to merchants who secretly lowered product quality or reduced materials to maximize profits through dishonest means.</p><p>This idiom first appeared in the Qing Dynasty novel <em>The Tale of Heroic Sons and Daughters</em> (儿女英雄传) by Wen Kang (文康), a novelist and Manchu bannerman. He is best known for writing this novel, which is also one of the last major works of classical Chinese vernacular fiction before the genre’s decline in the late 19th century.</p><p>The idiom appears in Chapter 2:</p><blockquote><p><em>“All the projects in this downstream area were carried out with shoddy, corner-cutting practices.”</em></p><p><em>这下游一带的工程，都是<strong>偷工减料</strong>作的。</em></p></blockquote><p>This line appears in a context discussing infrastructure projects during the Qing Dynasty, reflecting the integrity problems that plagued construction during that </p>...</source>
