I shall illustrate.</p><p>Once, while deep in the embrace of <em>Psilocybe cubensis</em>, I discovered the funniest thing in the world, a joke that may very well undergird all of creation. I did what I always do when I have a major epiphany: call my old buddy Joel. He patiently listened as I explained: <em>What if you had a friend who was deeply into the occult, but it turned out he was really Tom Bombadil</em>? (You know, from<em> The Lord of the Rings</em>?)

(“The summer before, I had tried to rewire my brain with mushrooms, but succeeded mainly in becoming temporarily psychic and reading <em>Anna Karenina </em>so hard I almost died.”) It is frequently funny, and it is occasionally beautiful, but after reaching the end of </p>...</source>
