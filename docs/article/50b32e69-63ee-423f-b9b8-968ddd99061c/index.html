The company said this did not represent a reversal of its previous stance, but rather the result of reconsidering how it interprets its existing policies.</p><p>As part of the move, the company is also terminating the accounts of several publications that endorse Nazi ideology and that <strong>Platformer</strong> flagged to the company for review last week.</p><p>The company will not change the text of its content policy, it says, and its new policy interpretation will not include proactively removing content related to neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. But Substack will continue to remove any material that includes “credible threats of physical harm,” it said.</p><p>In a statement, Substack’s co-founders told <strong>Platformer:</strong></p><blockquote><p>If and when we become aware of other content that violates our guidelines, we will take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p><p>Relatedly, we’ve heard your feedback about Substack’s content moderation approach, and we understand your concerns and those of some other writers on the platform. We sincerely regret how this controversy has affected writers on Substack.&nbsp;</p><p>We appreciate the input from everyone. Writers are the backbone of Substack and we take this feedback very seriously. We are actively working on more reporting tools that can be used to flag content that potentially violates our guidelines, and we will continue working on tools for user moderation so Substack users can set and refine the terms of their own experience on the platform.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Substack’s statement comes after weeks of controversy related to the company’s mostly laissez-faire approach to content moderation.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, Jonathan M.

The company responded on December 21, when Substack co-founder <a href="https://substack.com/@hamish/note/c-45811343">published a blog post</a> arguing that “censorship” of Nazi publications would only make extremism worse.</p><p>McKenzie also wrote that “we don’t like Nazis either” and said Substack wished “no-one held those views.” But “we don't think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away,” he wrote. “In fact, it makes it worse.
