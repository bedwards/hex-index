        <p>In a significant move for the longevity industry, Circulate Health has secured <strong>$12 million in Seed funding</strong>. The round was led by the high-profile venture firm <strong>Khosla Ventures</strong>, with participation from Seaside Ventures and CSC Ventures. The company plans to use the new capital to expand its clinic network and accelerate development efforts for its core offering: <strong>using TPE</strong> to <strong>lower biological age and reduce the risk of age-related disease</strong>.</p><h2>The Company &amp; The Investors</h2><ul><li><p><strong>The longevity startup:</strong> Circulate Health is led by CEO Dr. Brad Younggren and co-founded by Dr. Eric Verdin of the Buck Institute. The company delivers a complete TPE solution: equipment, trained staff, and protocols; to longevity and wellness clinics</p></li><li><p><strong>Expertise:</strong> A cornerstone of Circulate’s development is the expertise of <strong>Dr. Dobri Kiprov</strong>, who serves as the company’s Chief Medical Officer. Widely recognized as one of the pioneers of therapeutic plasma exchange, Dr. Kiprov has spent decades advancing TPE as a safe, standardized medical procedure.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Lead Investor:</strong> The involvement of Khosla Ventures, a top-tier firm known for backing high-risk, high-reward "moonshot" companies, is a major endorsement of Circulate's novel business model.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Syndicate:</strong> The round is supported by <strong>Seaside Ventures</strong>, which focuses on health and wellness, and <strong>CSC Ventures</strong>, which brings expertise in scaling tech companies.</p></li></ul><h2>Therapeutic Plasma Exchange: The Technology</h2><p>Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE<strong>)</strong> is a procedure in which a patient’s blood is drawn, plasma is separated and discarded, and the blood cells are returned along with a replacement solution (such as albumin). Unlike “young blood” transfusions that primarily focus on <em>adding</em> rejuvenating factors, TPE’s primary action is removal: extracting pro-inflammatory proteins, autoantibodies, and other molecules that accumulate over time and contribute to age-related decline.</p><p>In many protocols, including Circulate’s published clinical study with the Buck Institute, TPE is followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG<strong>)</strong> infusion, which serves for replenishes protective antibodies that were lost in the “cleansing” process, and further modulates immune function.</p><p>The company’s data suggest that this combination can significantly impact biological aging. In their study, participants receiving TPE and IVIG experienced an average reduction of <strong>2.6 years</strong> in measured biological age, with individuals who had higher burdens of inflammatory markers benefiting the most.</p><p>This emerging evidence positions TPE as a promising intervention for people who want to proactively address aging-related risks.</p><h2>Why It Matters for Longevity</h2><p>This investment signals a potential shift in ...</p>
