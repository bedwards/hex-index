It is one of the few industries to have built its foundation on creativity, art, and business. In the past, content creators had to earn your time and level of engagement with ads.

Today, it does not stop at the number of rising ads that users have to watch. Instead, with the help of ad trackers, businesses have the unchecked and unregulated power to follow you and passively instigate you into making a decision you are not fully convinced to make.</p><p>For example: If you’re browsing for a pair of headphones on Amazon and not sure which one to buy, the minute </p>...</source>
