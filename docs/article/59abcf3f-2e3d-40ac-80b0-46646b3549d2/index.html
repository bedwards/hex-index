Meanwhile, Dan Wang’s new book, <em>Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future</em>, offers an assured and lively technocratic account of the political and economic machinery behind that transformation.</p><p>In an early scene in <em>Caught by the Tides</em>, which stitches together new and archival fragments, and features actors from Jia’s prior films, including his longtime artistic collaborator and wife, Zhao Tao, a group of Chinese youth dance ecstatically to the Swedish pop song “Butterfly” by Smile.dk. The kinetic dancing scenes bleed into street celebrations of Beijing’s successful bid to host the 2008 Olympics. The evocative montage feels like a fever dream of a country in motion, being thrust into modernity.</p><p>Wang’s book traces the very same rise more soberly, explaining how the Soviet Union’s love of heavy industry shaped Beijing’s Politburo, for whom “production was a noble deed to advance communism, while consumption was a despicable act of capitalism.” Wang’s story, and Jia’s more lyrical companion, is one of a relentless focus on the “real” economy: modernizing poor regions of the country, glorifying production, and disdaining consumption. In the U.S., where a financialized economy long ago eclipsed a manufacturing one, Americans are almost resigned to a kind of material decay, if not a spiritual one.</p><p>Yet Wang also details the cracks in the China Hype Machine. One fissure in the growth narrative is the fallout from China’s imploded real estate bubble, including the corner-cutting that the breakneck growth encouraged. Long before the bubble burst, parents were already referring to collapsed schools in Sichuan as “tofu houses” due to their fragility, a shorthand for the costs of corruption and speed.</p><p>Tofu houses aside, </p>...</source>
