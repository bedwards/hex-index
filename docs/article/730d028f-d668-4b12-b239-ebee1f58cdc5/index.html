        <p>The month of August gave us an illustration of what experienced astrologers would call an astrological truth: So-called ‘harmonious’ constellations often promise more than they can deliver. The spectacular harmony of August’s symmetric ‘house configuration’, in which all of the outer planets took part, did match with the great show that Trump put on in Alaska to welcome Putin to establish himself as the peace maker number one on this planet. Since the Saturn-Neptune conjunction on the Aries Point was part of the picture, one could expect a highly visible event with a potential impact on world affairs. America’s natal chart and its Midheaven was directly affected by this constellation, suggesting that everybody’s eyes would turn to the US and its current president. And the world did.</p><p>But the hopes that were attached to this meeting of Trump and Putin soon collapsed like a house of cards, mirroring the fleeting character of the elements of fire and air that were exclusively involved in this planetary configuration. Has the peace-making process stopped altogether now? The planetary movements suggest that we will see echoes of August’s events in late September when Mercury and the Sun will enter Libra, triggering the Aries Point again. And, again, we will see an impressive configuration. This time it’s a beautiful ‘kite’:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png" width="630" height="374.71153846153845" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:866,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:630,&quot;bytes&quot;:5329417,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://cosmiccompanion.substack.com/i/172915572?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N2x8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9deb27ec-2faa-4cc1-85d5-0b64fc41827a_3571x2124.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Will we see another display of smoke and mirrors? Peace-talks that are just ‘hot air’ with no consequences? The situation in September is a little bit different. The kite configuration is flanked by two so-called ‘hard aspects’, namely an intense Mars-Pluto square and a relationship challenging Venus-Uranus square. Both put quite some pressure on the situation. With squares, something’s got to give and a decision has to be made. Since the Mars-Pluto square triggers Putin’s Scorpio Ascendant (if his official birth data can be trusted), he could be the one dominating the headlines this time around, feeling pushed to take forceful action.</p><p>What does this mean for the rest of us? Above configuration is quite exceptional in that it affects all of us who have planetary placements at the very beginning or the very end of <em>any</em> of the zodiac signs. And I think it’s safe to say that this means most of us. I wish I could break it down for every zodiac sign, but I’m afraid this would go beyond the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that those of you </p>...</source>
