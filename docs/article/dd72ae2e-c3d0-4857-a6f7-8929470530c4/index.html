      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>In recent years, I’ve become increasingly convinced that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are going to be the biggest story of our era. I think AI systems will transform not just the economy, but our societies, cultures, political institutions, ideologies, values, self-understandings, and much more. And I think this will happen over the next several decades, not centuries or millennia. </p><p>Given this, I want to spend a lot more time thinking about the social, political, and philosophical issues that AI raises. And that means I want to spend a lot more time talking to people with expertise and interesting opinions in this area. One such person is Dr <a href="https://henryshevlin.com/">Henry Shevlin</a>, a friend and brilliant academic at the University of Cambridge. </p><p>In this conversation, which is hopefully the first of many, we talk about some really big-picture issues:</p><ul><li><p>How we should understand state-of-the-art AI systems like ChatGPT-5</p></li><li><p>To what extent such systems are similar to human minds</p></li><li><p>Our proximity to truly transformative AI (and what “transformative AI” even means)</p></li><li><p>How we should measure AI progress</p></li><li><p>The economic impacts of AI</p></li><li><p>Whether future AI systems are likely to kill us all. </p></li></ul><p>We have some interesting disagreements about some of these issues. For example, Henry’s timelines for when we will reach transformative AI are shorter than mine. He is also <em>much </em>more worried that super-intelligent AI systems will eliminate the human species than I am.</p><p>I found the conversation really fun and informative. My hope is that others with interests in this area might also get something out of it. </p><p>Here are links to some of the things mentioned in the conversation: </p><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html?utm_">Shoggoth meme</a> to illustrate AI</p></li><li><p><a href="https://situational-awareness.ai/">Situational Awareness</a> by Leopold Aschenbrenner</p></li><li><p>Video by Miles Brundage <a href="https://x.com/Miles_Brundage/status/1956777848523641016">explaining AI trends</a> on a white board</p></li></ul>
