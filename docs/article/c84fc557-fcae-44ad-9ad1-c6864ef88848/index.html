        <p>Albert Einstein famously said:</p><p><em>“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”</em></p><p>I’d add to that and say:</p><p><em><strong>“If you can’t execute it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”</strong></em></p><p>What do I mean?</p><p>Well, lots of business leaders and entrepreneurs like to build big, complex teams and systems.</p><p>They live in a self-created storm of complexity, and everyone suffers because of it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Believe it or not, I used to be one of those guys.&nbsp;</em></p><p>A few years ago, I felt like I had the <em>secret</em> to productivity.</p><p>I spent countless hours researching and building what I thought was the best productivity system in the world.</p><p>The only problem?</p><p><strong>I spent more time working on my system…than, you know, actually…working.</strong></p><p>In my pursuit of building the best productivity system, I found myself doing the exact opposite of what a world-class productivity system does.</p><p>So, I took some time to reflect, and I realized something…</p><p>A great productivity system helps you:</p><ul><li><p>Prioritizes what’s important.</p></li><li><p>Finds time for deep work.</p></li><li><p>Stays on top of things so nothing falls through the cracks.</p></li></ul><p>And a great system runs like this:</p><ul><li><p>Quick setup time — up and running in a few minutes.</p></li><li><p>Highly flexible — that’s the nature of your work.</p></li><li><p>Easy to maintain — it’s the support system, not the main act.</p></li></ul><p>I got back to work.</p><p>When it was all said and done, the Minimalist Productivity System resulted from hundreds of iterations…</p><p>… Boiled down to the absolute minimum number of things required.&nbsp;</p><p>It runs on 3 apps only.</p><p>Listen, the fact that you’re reading my emails says one thing:&nbsp;</p><p>You’re ahead of the curve when it comes to productivity and performance.</p><p>That’s your strength, however, at a moment’s notice it will turn into your weakness…</p><p>… That is, if you fall down the “complexity rabbit hole.”</p><p>Take it from someone who’s been there, done that…</p><p><strong>Minimalism &gt; Complexity</strong></p><p>This is the way.</p><p>Simple is hard, but simple is better.</p><p>Simple takes years and years of boiling down complexity to its bare bones.</p><p>Not everyone makes it to the end of the road like I have.</p><p>Albert Einstein probably knew that better than anyone.</p><p>And that’s one reason why I’m so proud of my <em>Minimalist Productivity System.</em></p><p>Normally…this system is locked up inside the Elite Performer Vault.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since we’re celebrating retirement you can get your hands on it ...</p>
