        <p>Christianity is the belief that through the bodily death and resurrection of Jesus there is forgiveness of sins, and fallen, sinful human beings can be declared righteous by God, being made sons and daughters of the Heavenly Father. This is the Christian Gospel and has been for 2000 years. This Gospel provides salvation for men and women, boys and girls, white and black, Asian and European, African and American, rich and poor, learned and unlearned. In other words, it promises salvation for any and all who confess faith in Christ. Once that person comes to Christ in saving faith all their sins are forgiven and their true identity is in Christ. No longer is their core identity to be their job, talents, physical attributes, or level of intelligence; rather they are now sons and daughters of God, and brothers and sisters with Christ and one another. All past and future sins are put away through the sacrificial work of Jesus and people express their oneness in local church membership and participation as the body of Christ Jesus. That's Christianity 101 made simple.</p><p> In stark contrast to this is the new religion of Woke-ness. I refer to it as a religion because it has all the elements of a religion. Ultimately, however, it is a false religion that Christians must be aware of due to its luring many professing believers away from Biblical Orthodoxy.

My great fear is that many people who formerly recognized themselves as being in Christ and in his Body have now, through falling prey to human philosophy and the spirit of this age, found themselves on the outside of the Christian faith, even now advocating for a "new" faith that is not Christian at all.</p><p> Woke ideology, in its most simplistic form, means that a person has become aware (woke) of perceived social and racial injustices that occur in society. Many that hold to this ideology do so because they mainly see the world and society through the lens of race and identity groups. Paired with this ...</p>
