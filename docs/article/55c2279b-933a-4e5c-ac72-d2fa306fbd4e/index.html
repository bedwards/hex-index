        <p><em>Boozhoo, indinawemaaganidog! Aaniin! That is to say hello, all of my relatives! Welcome to another edition of</em> An Irritable Métis<em>. I must confess that I just spent ten minutes scratching my head and pacing my office<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> and then scrolling back through three years of posts to come to the realization that when I said last month that the November 1st edition of the sentences  marked </em><strong>THREE UNINTERRUPTED YEARS!</strong><em> of sharing this practice with you, I was </em><strong>wrong</strong><em>. That milestone has actually been reached </em><strong>TODAY!</strong><em>, on December 1st. I know! I’d been thinking all along that I started writing the sentences for sharing on October 1st, 2022, and shared the first batch on November 1st. That is incorrect. I started vigorously attending to them on November 1st of 2022, and the first actual post came on </em><strong>December</strong><em> 1st, three exact years ago.</em><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p><em>You may say, “Yeah, so?” and I assure you it matters. We run a tight ship around here!</em></p><p><em>If you are scratching your own head and making a “WTF?” face, I’m going to assume you are new here, and I am happy to explain that this monthly edition, where I post the daily, single sentences that I’ve accumulated for the month-just-ended, is based on the practice that ultimately led to my first book, </em><strong><a href="https://www.factandfictionbooks.com/book/9781732496804">One-Sentence Journal</a></strong><em>, back in 2018.</em><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p><em>It’s a simple practice and fulfilling … and also maybe not so simple as it may seem. Regardless, the practice is excellent training for paying attention to the small moments of my life, and I enjoy sharing those moments here. This remains the best and most consistent aspect of my writing efforts, and something within the reach of anyone who simply wants to be a more attentive participant in their own life.</em></p><p><em>I’m always interested in readings offerings from any of you practicing similarly. Share them in the comments! Also, if you’ve been around since that very first post, feel free to raise your hand via a comment as well. I’m very grateful and I would love to recognize you, even if only via a fist bump emoji or the like.</em></p><h4>Friends, before I continue, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that if you receive the email alerts concerning <strong>IndigiPalooza MT: Resistance 250+</strong> you will know that we announced our headliner for the next edition, which is scheduled for July 31/August 1 of ...</h4>
