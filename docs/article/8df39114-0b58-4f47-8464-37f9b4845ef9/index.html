        <p>Every few months I put together a guide on which AI system to use. Since I last wrote my guide, however, there has been a subtle but important shift in how the major AI products work. Increasingly, it isn't about the best model, it is about the best overall system for most people. The good news is that picking an AI is easier than ever and you have three excellent choices. The challenge is that these systems are getting really complex to understand. I am going to try and help a bit with both.</p><p>First, the easy stuff.</p><h1>Which AI to Use</h1><p>For most people who want to use AI seriously, you should pick one of three systems: <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude </a>from Anthropic, Google’s <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>, and OpenAI’s <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">ChatGPT</a>. With all of the options, you get access to both advanced and fast models, a voice mode, the ability to see images and documents, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, the ability to create images and video (Claude lacks here, however), and the ability to do Deep Research. Some of these features are free, but you are generally going to need to pay $20/month to get access to the full set of features you need. I will try to give you some reasons to pick one model or another as we go along, but you can’t go wrong with any of them. </p><p>What about everyone else? I am not going to cover specialized AI tools (some people love Perplexity for search, Manus is a great agent, etc.) but there are a few other options for general purpose AI systems: <a href="https://x.ai/">Grok </a>by Elon Musk’s xAI is good if you are a big X user, though the company has not been very transparent about how its AI operates. Microsoft’s <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Copilot </a>offers many of the features of ChatGPT and is accessible to users through Windows, but it can be hard to control what models you are using and when. <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a> r1, a Chinese model, is very capable and free to use, but is missing a few features from the other companies and it is not clear that they will keep up in the long term. So, for most people, just stick with Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT</p><p>Great! This was the shortest recommendation post yet! Except… picking a system is just the beginning. The real challenge is understanding how to use these increasingly complex ...</p>
