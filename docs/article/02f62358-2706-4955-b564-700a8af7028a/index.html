To this end, they created plug-ins for Ableton Live and an open-source hardware instrument called the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/nsynth-super">NSynth Super</a> that you could build yourself according to specifications that Magenta made available online. That was about seven years ago, now. Two years ago, the research team that Magenta was part of merged with DeepMind and presumably became part of Google’s current AI efforts.</p><p>The NSynth Super is kind of a fascinating artifact in retrospect. I was very interested in it back then, but I don’t know if I really comprehended the implications of what it was doing. I remember the sounds it made being very fuzzy. They sometimes resembled familiar instruments, but it sounded as if you were hearing them through a kind of audible fog or haze. Turning the dials to try to lock in on a sound I liked reminded me very much of sitting in front of a CRT TV as a child, moving an antenna around trying to pick up a signal that would turn the fuzzy distortion on the screen into entertainment.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png" width="1456" height="839" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:839,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3243686,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://jaimebrooks.substack.com/i/179477444?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!37zO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F151635a4-5c59-4da2-96cc-ee6e896f021a_2190x1262.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Today, I hear that same fuzz in the outputs of AI music platforms like Suno. Along with the robotic quirks of the vocal performances these platforms generate, the fuzziness is one of the most obvious signs that a song has been AI-generated, at least if you know what to listen for. There’s just a lot less of it now. The picture behind the fuzz is a lot clearer, to the point where you kind of forget it’s there if the content behind it is engaging enough. </p><p>Suno outputs frequently sound tinny, stilted, bitcrushed, and compressed within an inch of their lives, but so does a lot of the music that people make with DAWs and home recording equipment. When Marley Marl first started loading drum hits from old records he liked into a sampler to program his own beats with them, the audio quality of the samples needed to be very poor in order to fit them into the sampler’s limited memory. He still made classics. When producers abandoned hardware samplers and specialized studio equipment for computers at the turn of the millenium, popular music as a whole started to become palpably cold, rigid, </p></source>...</source>
