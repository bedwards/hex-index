That is the amount of time it took Amazon to be called a Profit Making business. The year was 1997, and Jeff Bezos openly writes to his new investors a letter stating the importance of Market Share.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>It’s All About the Long Term</strong></em></p><p>We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term.
