Understanding this unrecognized breakaway state, its Soviet-backed origins, the 1992 war, and ongoing Russian military presence provides essential context for why Ilașcu&#039;s struggle was significant and why Moldova&#039;s territorial integrity remains contested.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Ilașcu led the Tiraspol branch of this movement from 1989-1992. This pro-independence, pro-Romanian political movement was central to Moldova&#039;s break from the Soviet Union and the subsequent ethnic tensions that led to the Transnistria conflict - directly contextualizing Ilașcu&#039;s activism.</p>

Ilaşcu was the founder of the National Liberation Movement of Bessarabia (1988 - 1992) and became a symbol of Moldovan and Romanian resistance to the abuses of the Transnistrian “authorities.” Living in Tiraspol Ilaşcu campaigned for the 35,000 ethnically  and linguistically Romanian residents (17% of the city’s population at the time) who had no schools or other public facilities in their native language. He led the Tiraspol branch of the Popular Front of Moldova from 1989 until it was liquidated by the Transnistrian “authorities” in 1992. </p><p>During the war he fought behind the lines with a special purpose military unit under the  Ministry of National Security of the Republic of Moldova. In 1992 he was arrested along with other leaders of the group in Tiraspol by elements of the Soviet / Russian 14th Army and sentenced to death. </p><p>While in prison, Ilie Ilașcu was elected to the Moldovan parliament and became an MP from 1994-2000 during his prison tenure. He was then elected to the Romanian parliament and became a Romanian parliamentary delegate to the Council of Europe - all while sitting in a Tiraspol prison. After 9 years in prison he was released following international diplomatic pressure. In later life he served as a Romanian Senator before retiring from public life in Bucharest. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png" width="461" height="461" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:461,&quot;bytes&quot;:2087185,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/180014565?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!t3pi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38760c7d-3cb1-4c3c-b4a5-36ef06dc7f31_1080x1080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>Left: Ilie Ilașcu in Transnistrian detention, Right: in 2007 in Bucharest.
