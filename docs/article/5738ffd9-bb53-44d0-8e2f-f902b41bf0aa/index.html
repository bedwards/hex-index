Then, that same evening, came a shift in variation: the pair was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/justin-trudeau-katy-perry-montreal-restaurant-1.7596391">photographed</a> in the city’s swanky Le Violon restaurant. The tempo quickened. Were they friends? Was it a business dinner? Was Trudeau trying to get some guidance for <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/music/articles/justin-trudeau-receives-help-katy-113128121.html?guccounter=1">his son Xavier’s rapping career</a>?</p><p>In mid-October, the concerto reached its crescendo: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1339009007753840">photos</a> of the couple locked in passionate embrace on a yacht in California surfaced online. A fortnight later came the finale fans were longing for: the pair walked out from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsIr3PB0TK0">forty-first birthday dinner</a> for Perry at the Crazy Horse in Paris—the “City of Love,” no less—hand-in-hand.</p><p>But the performance, however stirring, invites interpretation. Do all those public displays of affection actually signify love? Or is their coupling a case study in how celebrity, residual political stature, and cultural capital intersect? Trudeau, newly out of office, still carries the afterglow of executive authority. Perry embodies a different kind of reach, forged through global fame and affective intimacy with audiences—even as that stardom seems to be dipping.</p><p>It’s worth asking what draws public figures to one another when formal power fades but symbolic capital remains. Mutual curiosity? Strategic alignment? Or something more elemental: the proximity to lives that once shaped events and may yet do so again?</p><p>Of course, if you still believe it’s romance, you might want to stop reading now.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>You can’t share stories from </strong><em><strong>thewalrus.ca</strong></em><strong> on Facebook or Instagram because of Meta’s response to the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-you-might-stop-seeing-canadian-news/">Online News Act</a>, but you can share this Substack article there</strong></h4><div><hr></div><p><strong>John Street taught politics</strong> at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, England (he’s now retired). His research examined the interplay between politics, media, and popular culture. When I asked him about TruPerry—as my editor and I have taken to calling the couple—Street invoked “the Kissinger effect,” named for the late United States secretary of state. The term was coined, in part, to capture Kissinger’s influence on foreign policy, but Street also extends it to his social life. </p>...</source>
