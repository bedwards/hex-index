        <h3>“Fearlessness is what love seeks… Such fearlessness exists only in the complete calm that can no longer be shaken by events expected of the future… Hence the only valid tense is the present, the Now.”</h3>
<hr>
<p><em>“Love, but be careful what you love,”</em> the Roman African philosopher Saint Augustine wrote in the final years of the fourth century. We are, in some deep sense, what we love — we become it as much as it becomes us, beckoned from our myriad conscious and unconscious longings, despairs, and patterned desires. And yet there is something profoundly paradoxical about such an appeal to reason in the notion that we can exercise prudence in matters of love — to have loved is to have known the straitjacket of irrationality that slips over even the most willful mind when the heart takes over with its delicious carelessness.  </p>
<p>How to heed Augustine’s caution, not by subjugating but by better understanding our experience of love, is what <strong>Hannah Arendt</strong> (October 14, 1906–December 4, 1975) explores in her least known but in many ways most beautiful work, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Saint-Augustine-Hannah-Arendt/dp/0226025977/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Love and Saint Augustine</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/love-and-saint-augustine/oclc/751550545&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — Arendt’s first book-length manuscript and the last to be published in English, posthumously salvaged from her papers by political scientist Joanna Vecchiarelli Scott and philosopher Judith Chelius Stark. </p>

<p>For half a century after she wrote it as her doctoral thesis in 1929 — a time when this apostle of reason, who would become one of the twentieth century’s keenest and most coolly analytical minds, was composing her <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/04/25/hannah-arendt-martin-heidegger-love-letters/">fiery love letters to Martin Heidegger</a> — Arendt obsessively revised and annotated the manuscript. Against Augustine’s whetstone, she came to hone her core philosophical ideas — chiefly the troublesome disconnect she saw between philosophy and politics as evidenced by the rise of ideologies like totalitarianism, the origins of which she <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/12/20/hannah-arendt-origins-of-totalitarianism-loneliness-isolation/">so memorably and incisively examined</a>. It was from Augustine that she borrowed the phrase <em>amor mundi</em> — “love of the world” — which would become a defining feature of her philosophy. Occupied by questions of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/07/hannah-arendt-the-banality-of-evil/">why we succumb to and normalize evil</a>, Arendt identified as the root of tyranny the act of making other human beings irrelevant. Again and again, she returned to Augustine for the antidote: love.</p>
