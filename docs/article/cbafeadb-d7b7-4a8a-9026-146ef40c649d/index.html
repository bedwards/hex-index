        <p>“What is the state of the tech jobs market in 2025?” is the question this article tackles in the third and final part of our mini-series on that major subject. We hear from job platforms, and from tech professionals searching for their next opportunity. This article features Wellfound (a jobs platform with around 6M software engineering profiles), and data from Revealera, an alternative data platform. There are also more than 30 software engineers and engineering leaders who discussed their job hunting experience with me. Today, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Job platform data. </strong>Falling demand for remote work, more “barriers” put up by companies, slightly higher demand for backend engineers than before, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>Junior engineer recruitment rebounds? </strong>More scaleups and publicly traded tech companies are doubling down on hiring new grads and early-career engineers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Picky employers. </strong>More hiring managers hold out for the “perfect candidate,” more rejections come with no feedback, and some think the candidate quality is down, overall. Referrals seem like the only way to consistently get interviews.</p></li><li><p><strong>Software engineer archetypes in and out of demand. </strong>AI engineers, those with Big Tech experience, and infra+SRE engineers are in demand. Times are reportedly tougher for candidates who took career breaks, are self-taught, or are native mobile engineers.</p></li><li><p><strong>State of engineering leadership hiring. </strong>It’s very tough everywhere, especially for experienced engineering managers not yet at Director level. One executive recruiter says many leadership candidates have poor AI skills and unrealistic pay expectations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote market</strong>. It’s harder to land a job and compensation is lower, but the bar is higher for remote positions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regional observations. </strong>Outside of cities, the market is tougher: in Germany, Wayfair’s exit could drag down pay. Are Swiss companies looking to hire in cheaper EU countries?</p></li></ol><p>Previous articles in this series covered:</p><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025">Part 1: what the data says</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Tech job stats</p></li><li><p>AI Engineering trends</p></li><li><p>Big Tech hiring stats</p></li><li><p>Growing importance of location</p></li><li><p>Tenure rising fast at Big Tech</p></li><li><p>Where are Big Tech engineers moving to and from?</p></li><li><p>Engineering leadership recruitment</p></li><li><p>Remote jobs</p></li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/state-of-the-tech-market-in-2025-hiring-managers">Part 2: what hiring managers see</a></strong></p><ul><li><p>Flood of applications</p></li><li><p>Few hires via inbound</p></li><li><p>‘Top’ candidates are hard to find</p></li><li><p>Remote jobs: more competition for less comp?</p></li><li><p>Fake applicants + AI: a growing problem</p></li><li><p>Higher demand for founding engineers and product engineers</p></li><li><p>Early-stage startups have their own hiring problems</p></li></ul><p><em>As usual, I have no affiliation with vendors mentioned in this article, and have not been paid to </em>...</p>
