Ten years later, the organization is at the forefront of trying to help decision-makers in government and industry navigate the transition to advanced AI.</em></p><p><em>GovAI is now hiring for its next cohort of <a href="https://www.governance.ai/post/research-scholar">Research Scholars</a> and <a href="https://www.governance.ai/post/research-fellow">Research Fellows</a>. Scholars are one-year positions that provide an intellectual home for ambitious researchers and policy professionals looking to advance their careers or transition into AI policy.

She writes about a Chinese entrepreneur who runs the world’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/magazine/blued-china-gay-dating-app.html">largest gay dating app</a> and once shook hands with Premier Li Keqiang (now deceased). She writes about how <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-github-free-speech-covid-information/">GitHub became an information haven</a> during COVID censorship. She writes about <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/online/2024/07/09/planet-tiktok/">the hyper-growth and malaise of TikTok</a>: a global company both blessed by realized ambition and cursed by geopolitics.</p><p>If there’s a converging theme, Yi-Ling’s work always returns to technology and political participation in China, a place long portrayed by familiar discourse as internet’s aberration; <em>Chinese internet is a prison, not the free, equal, and luminous internet we were promised!</em> Yet by 2026, that discourse had aged poorly.
