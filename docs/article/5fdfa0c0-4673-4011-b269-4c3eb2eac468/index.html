For instance, just last week, Akeneo <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/akeneo-raises-45-million-for-its-product-information-management-service/">raised</a></strong> $46 million in a round led by a Boston-based VC firm.<br> <br> So today we're going to revisit (and update) what I wrote in March about why Paris is, in my opinion, the most exciting tech scene in Europe.</p><h4>A week in Paris</h4><p> I’m sitting at a coffee shop on the 5ème Arrondisement right now. <br> <br> I spent the better part of this week having coffee with startup founders, employees and investors in the Paris ecosystem. Some were French, most of them weren’t.<br> <br> After living for more than a year over here, and coming back this week, I think the stunning French city has morphed into a thriving start-up ecosystem. <br> <br> Great things are happening behind a façade of astounding medieval architecture and as a consequence, Paris is increasingly becoming a great place to do startup things.<br> <br> But why?</p><h4>It all starts at the top – government</h4><p>The government of President Emmanuel Macron believes that technology and innovation should play a key role in the development of the French economy.<br> <br> A few months ago, the president himself announced his intention to make sure Paris, and the country overall move from being just a “start-up nation” to “a country of global-player technology companies”.</p><p><br> One of the main initiatives comes from Digital Minister Mounir Mahjoubi, who announced that the country would invest at least 150 million euros in funding by 2020, according to </p>...</source>
