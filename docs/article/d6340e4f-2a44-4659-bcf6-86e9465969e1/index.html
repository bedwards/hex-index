        <p>The UAE has been making an ambitious play over the past decade for regional dominance stretching from their own shores to the Horn of Africa and beyond, paying particular attention to control of the Red Sea. In addition to its recent gambit with Israel to entrench a separatist state in Somaliland over the furious objections of both the Arab League and African Union, Abu Dhabi has begun challenging its own neighbors by bolstering an ill-fated secessionist uprising in southern Yemen. That movement was <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/yemen-uae-saudi-southern-transitional-council">suppressed by a rapid Saudi-backed military offensive</a> that has sharpened tensions with the Emiratis.</p><p>The UAE has learned to punch above its weight by mastering the art of buying  influence with global elites—<a href="https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/his-town/">particularly in Washington</a>, but also through a deepening strategic partnership with Israel that came into the open with the 2020 Abraham Accords. The story of how a diminutive Gulf state came to sit so close to the center of global power has never been fully told. And Jeffrey Epstein played a part in coaching Emirati elites and building the relationship between Israel and the UAE.</p><p>The story below, based on private correspondence from Epstein spanning more than a decade, tells the story of his intimate relationship with Sultan Sulayem, the powerful head of the Dubai Ports World financial empire and an individual closely connected to the Emirati ruling families. The story helps reveal the hidden backstory of the Abraham Accords, which were signed one year after Epstein’s death. </p><p>This is the latest in Drop Site’s <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/s/epstein-and-israel">series on Epstein’s intelligence </a>ties, and there is more to come. More leaked communications to analyze. More security deals to track. But we can only continue if we have the resources and legal protection to defend this work.</p><p>We don’t answer to advertisers worried about powerful governments. We don’t have billionaire owners with business interests to protect. <strong>We answer only to you.</strong></p><p>That’s why we can publish the Epstein intelligence investigations that mainstream outlets refuse to touch. And that’s why we need your support to defend them when those powerful interests come after us for publishing them.</p><p><a href="https://givebutter.com/dsn-substack">If you value this reporting, can you make a tax-deductible donation today to help us keep going?</a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg" width="795" height="808" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:808,&quot;width&quot;:795,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:70989,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/184563423?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Qd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5839e031-317c-487e-ac66-fc4abfbd1da8_795x808.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Jeffrey Epstein and DP World chief Sultan Sulayem.
