        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly contrasts England&#039;s stability during Austen&#039;s era with France&#039;s revolutionary upheaval, referencing &#039;August 4, 1789&#039; when feudal rights were abolished. Understanding the Great Fear and why France burned while England didn&#039;t is central to the article&#039;s thesis about the peculiar peace that enabled Austen&#039;s world.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article emphasizes Austen&#039;s revolutionary narrative technique of moving &#039;subtly between impartial narrative and the character&#039;s perspective.&#039; This is the technical literary term for Austen&#039;s innovation that the article credits with creating modern novelistic expectations.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses the marriage market as &#039;portfolio optimization under legal and informational frictions&#039; and mentions &#039;primogeniture, entail, and limited labor-market access.&#039; Entail is the specific legal mechanism that drives the plot of Pride and Prejudice (the Bennet estate cannot pass to daughters), making it essential context.</p>
