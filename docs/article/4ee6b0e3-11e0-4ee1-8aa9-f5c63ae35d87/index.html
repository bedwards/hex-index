The government has hired a major firm with ties to the Trump administration to lobby in Washington for U.S. recognition, according to a recent Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing. Somalia hired its own lobbying firm to counter the offensive, marking a rival influence campaign that could potentially reshape U.S. policy in the Horn of Africa.</p><p>Nestpoint, a Dallas-based private equity and government affairs firm, was retained by Somaliland to “develop and execute a comprehensive strategy to secure international recognition…by engaging U.S. government stakeholders,” the filing states. The firm will receive $7,500 a month under the one-year contract that was signed in October and registered under FARA in December, and which also calls for pitching investment in Somaliland. In a December<a href="https://www.nestpointgroup.com/post/republic-of-somaliland-retains-nestpoint-to-advance-u-s-recognition-and-economic-self-reliance"> news release</a> published on its website, Nestpoint said it had two goals for its new client: diplomatic recognition and economic self-reliance.</p><p>“Their [Nestpoint’s] ability to bridge the gap between diplomatic advocacy and economic development makes them the ideal partner to help Somaliland take its rightful place on the world stage,” read part of a statement attributed to Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi.</p><p>Nestpoint is<a href="https://www.nestpointgroup.com/company/people"> run</a> by a coterie of prominent GOP strategists, including cable TV pundit John Thomas. The firm counts former 2016 Trump campaign field director Stuart Jolly as its chief lobbyist. Jolly, who Trump<a href="https://okcfox.com/news/fox-25-investigates/this-is-the-man-meet-the-oklahoma-who-helped-trump-win"> personally congratulated</a> on stage for his first primary win in New Hampshire, also previously ran the pro-Trump Super PAC, Great America PAC. He is listed as one of the lobbyists in the FARA disclosure.</p><p>Somaliland’s move to enter the lobbying arena comes amid a full-court press by influential GOP think tanks to recognize the territory, which has emerged as a strategic battleground in a growing struggle to exert influence over the Horn of Africa region. A Washington Post<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2026/01/12/somaliland-trump-somalia-africa/"> op-ed</a> by Joshua Meservey, a fellow at the neoconservative Hudson Institute, said recognition was “recognizing reality.” Michael Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, went as far as to<a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/recognizing-somaliland-wont-cause-war-it-will-prevent-one/"> say</a> U.S. recognition would prevent a war between Somaliland and Somalia—despite Israeli recognition already <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/mogadishu-hargeisa-somalia-somaliland-israel-recognition-uae">triggering threats</a> of armed confrontation and separatist violence.</p><p>Despite calls to embrace Somaliland, Nestpoint faces an uphill battle in Washington.
