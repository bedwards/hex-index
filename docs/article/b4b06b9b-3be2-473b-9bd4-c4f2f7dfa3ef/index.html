        <p>I recorded a Substack Live with <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Yassine Meskhout&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:18840496,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.com/@ymeskhout&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c454ded4-41e5-44f3-9171-e67d8e99329d_1323x1323.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;7a8ebf9e-8afd-457f-8484-5f0af08b4449&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> on Thursday. It was an interesting conversation, or at least a conversation that I personally found interesting. Among other things, we talked about: </p><ul><li><p>Whether we can blame the objective failures of establishment institutions for the pathologies of the modern MAGA information environment. (I’m <a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/elite-failures-and-populist-backlash">sceptical</a>, which is something I’ve changed my mind about).</p></li><li><p>Whether establishment failures are worse than they used to be. </p></li><li><p>What I call the “polarisation-politicisation doom loop” that explains many of the USA’s deep informational problems and why they seem to be getting worse. </p></li><li><p>Why Republican hostility towards the expert class and establishment institutions (e.g., universities, science, mainstream media, the administrative state, etc.) has less to do with their objective failures than with their <a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/should-we-trust-misinformation-experts">politicisation</a> and <a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/status-class-and-the-crisis-of-expertise">connection to class dynamics</a>. </p></li><li><p>Whether rational persuasion is effective (and why it feels like it’s ineffective even when it isn’t). </p></li><li><p>Why “truth” is often not the primary function of beliefs in domains like religion and politics. </p></li><li><p>How libertarians (like Yassine) fit into the current political landscape in the US. </p></li></ul><p>Links: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://substack.com/@ymeskhout">Yassine’s Substack</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/the-puzzle-of-populist-devotion-how">The puzzle of populist devotion: How alliances and propaganda explain right-wing populism</a> (Dan Williams)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/is-social-media-destroying-democracyor">Is Social Media Destroying Democracy—Or Giving It To Us Good And Hard?</a> (Dan Williams)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.conspicuouscognition.com/p/status-class-and-the-crisis-of-expertise">Status, class, and the crisis of expertise</a> (Dan Williams)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/on-the-belief-that-beliefs-should-change-according-to-evidence-implications-for-conspiratorial-moral-paranormal-political-religious-and-science-beliefs/254C6EF93A5E037998EB7E1003627CB6">On the belief that beliefs should change according to evidence: Implications for conspiratorial, moral, paranormal, political, religious, and science beliefs</a> (Pennycook et al; Judgment &amp; Decision Making)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ymeskhout.com/p/against-delusion-based-politics">Against Delusion-Based Politics</a> (Yassine Meskhout)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ymeskhout.com/p/party-of-cucks">Party of Cucks</a> (Yassine Meskhout)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.ymeskhout.com/p/how-to-protest-well">How to Protest Well</a> (Yassine Meskhout)</p></li></ul>
