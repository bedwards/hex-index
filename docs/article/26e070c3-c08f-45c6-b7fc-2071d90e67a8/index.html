      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>There’s a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/2026/01/elite-university-student-accommodation/684946/?utm_medium=offsite&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=newsstand-ideas">new article</a> in <em>The Atlantic </em>about how more and more students are identifying as “disabled” to receive extra time on exams. </p><blockquote><p>The increase is driven by more young people getting diagnosed with conditions such as <a href="https://apple.news/AoYr-aolxTt2olKfqHfEv9w">ADHD</a>, <a href="https://apple.news/Pgwvs0OywOu5-ISaQMWvGpR">anxiety</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/mental-health-crisis-teens.html">depression</a>, and by universities making the process of getting accommodations easier. The change has occurred disproportionately at the most prestigious and expensive institutions. At Brown and Harvard, more than 20 percent of undergraduates are registered as disabled. At Amherst, that figure is 34 percent. Not all of those students receive accommodations, but researchers told me that most do. The schools that enroll the most academically successful students, in other words, also have the largest share of students with a disability that could prevent them from succeeding academically.</p><p>“You hear ‘students with disabilities’ and it’s not kids in wheelchairs,” one professor at a selective university, who requested anonymity because he doesn’t have tenure, told me. “It’s just not. It’s rich kids getting extra time on tests.” Even as poor students with disabilities still struggle to get necessary provisions, elite universities have entered an age of accommodation. Instead of leveling the playing field, the system has put the entire idea of fairness at risk…</p><p>According to Weis’s research, only 3 to 4 percent of students at public two-year colleges receive accommodations, a proportion that has stayed relatively stable over the past 10 to 15 years. He and his co-authors found that students with learning disabilities who request accommodations at community colleges “tend to have histories of academic problems beginning in childhood” and evidence of ongoing impairment. At four-year institutions, by contrast, about half of these students “have no record of a diagnosis or disability classification prior to beginning college.”</p></blockquote><p>Something similar has happened with standardized tests. Between 2012-2013 and 2016-2017, the number of approved accommodation requests to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) <a href="https://www.lsac.org/data-research/research/accommodated-test-taker-trends-and-performance-june-2012-through-february">jumped</a> from 729 to 3,000. By 2022-2023, the <a href="https://www.lsac.org/sites/default/files/research/TR-24-01.pdf">number was over 15,000.</a> About 98% of accommodation requests were approved, meaning the process was basically automatic. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png" width="939" height="328" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:328,&quot;width&quot;:939,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:45457,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.richardhanania.com/i/180697653?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uTk2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ed6a132-b745-4f21-baa0-ce63ad93f0e4_939x328.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">LSAT accommodations requested and received by school year. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This comes out to about 11% of tests being administered under the condition of some kind of accommodation, up from less than 1% a decade before.
