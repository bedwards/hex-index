      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>In my previous deep-thought article entitled “<a href="https://thecyberwhy.substack.com/p/the-next-era-of-cyber-security-capabilities">The Next Era of Cyber Security Capabilities</a>,” I explored the evolution and requirement for “context” in modern cybersecurity products. The critical difference between traditional cybersecurity technologies and contemporary platforms is the use of context and artificial intelligence to make more intelligent and accurate decisions. The new era of cyber takes infinite data points and adds them together to create context, then feeds that context back into the training algorithms, thus gaining compounding value over time. AI is required to process these large data sets to derive context-based answers rapidly, suggesting a future where AI-driven cybersecurity technologies can observe and protect digital realms like never before.</p><p>Given this description of a “contextual” cybersecurity future, specific requirements exist for any vendor that wishes to become the dominant player in the emerging contextual security (AI cyber) space. Both technology and usability innovations are required in this new and exciting area of cybersecurity products. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ejMm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp" width="1456" height="832" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc970ef6-6738-4d7b-9503-bbc264bef03a_1792x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:832,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;A futuristic scene in the style of the movie 'Minority Report' depicting a precog finding criminals in the future.

Look for these criteria in the vendor you invest in.</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Winners</strong>: Vendors that embrace AI and machine learning to enhance contextual analysis will come out ahead. Companies that effectively integrate their solutions with broader ecosystems, ensuring seamless data flow and contextual insights across different platforms, are poised to succeed. Those who invest in developing systems that can rapidly adapt to new threats and offer proactive security measures based on rich contextual data will be at the forefront.</p><p><strong>Losers</strong>: Vendors that fail to move beyond traditional, siloed approaches to cybersecurity will struggle. Companies that are slow to integrate AI and machine learning or do not effectively utilize the increasing availability of data for contextual analysis will fall behind. Vendors that resist evolving their products to work seamlessly in cloud-based, API-driven environments or cannot provide a holistic view of security threats will lose relevance.</p><h3>Criteria for Contextual Cybersecurity Success</h3><p>The future </p>...</source>
