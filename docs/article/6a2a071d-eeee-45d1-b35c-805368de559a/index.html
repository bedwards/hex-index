        <p><em>Dear Readers, I’ve been reporting this story for several weeks. It features on-the-record quotes from prominent CDC/NIH alumni, legal experts, and input from more than a dozen additional sources whose identities are protected here. It’s a 3,700-word deep dive into how the Trump administration tried to dismantle the CDC’s peer review process for external grants—and how career staff worked to save the system that ensures rigor and fairness in its decision making. </em></p><p><em>If you find this valuable, please share it and consider upgrading to support Inside Medicine.

For the CDC to fulfill its duties, knowledge gaps like these—<em>known unknowns</em>—must be filled. How many American kids have epilepsy? Are men being asked the right questions when considering whether to receive prostate cancer screening? The answers guide national priorities and policies. </p><p>Answering these questions takes research, research that CDC scientists cannot perform, owing to lack of in-house expertise, sufficient resources, or both. So, a simple solution has long been in place: outsourcing.</p><p>The CDC sends around <a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/cdcs-funding-for-state-and-local-public-health-how-much-and-where-does-it-go/">80%</a> of all the money it receives <em>back out the door, </em>including to state and local health departments. Around 10-20% of this goes toward competitive external research grants, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars every year, funding that supports research into chronic diseases, birth defects, injury, global health, and infectious diseases.</p><p><em>Inside Medicine </em>has learned that earlier this year, the Trump administration quietly dismantled the external peer review <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/other/pdf/Peer-Review-CDC-20230726.pdf">procedure</a> that assured that CDC-funded extramural research reflected the “most meritorious ideas and projects,” and maintained public accountability. </p><p>Interviews with more than a dozen current and former HHS employees and legal experts reveal what appears to be another retreat from the venerable systems that safeguard transparency and fairness in federal science—only to be replaced by a looser framework prone to political influence and cronyism.</p><p>Even so, CDC scientific officers identified a workaround, and attempted to get these grants funded before the 2025 fiscal year ended on September 30. They wouldn’t know until the last minute if they had succeeded. </p><h3><strong>A system designed to ensure quality and fairness is scrapped.</strong></h3><p>Since 2003, CDC policy has required that outside (“extramural”) research funding decisions </p>...</source>
