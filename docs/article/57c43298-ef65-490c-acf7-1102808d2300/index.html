        <h1><strong>Abstract</strong></h1><p>Matthieu Pageau says that Satan is first a <em>function</em> before a villain; a God‑created tester and accuser whose corruption occurs only when will‑to‑power takes over. Firstly, he lays out a symbolic grammar where heaven represents “the plan” and earth represents “the materials,” with water serving the dual role of destruction and renewal. Secondly, he reframes the “feminine” principle as that which <em>crowns</em> and renovates forms. Gödel’s incompleteness theorem, he claims, is Eve bringing a riddle to Adam. Thirdly, he speaks from his own exile… Matthieu is partial to Orthodoxy and Catholicism, and at the same time he’s unable to plant a flag until certain unanswered questions resolve (these questions are explored in the podcast). The stories of Tamar and Ruth trace exile and redemption, while the Adam and Eve story reveal what secrecy breaks. This is a rare interview. With a high degree of likelihood, I can say that if watched until the end, it will change your life.</p><div id="youtube2-UGBec5p7VMU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;UGBec5p7VMU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UGBec5p7VMU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Who Is Matthieu Pageau?</strong></h2><p>Matthieu Pageau is a Canadian thinker and the author of <em>The Language of Creation: Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis</em> (2018). He is the brother of the Orthodox icon‑carver Jonathan Pageau (<a href="https://youtu.be/X3co_AA6yec">who I spoke to here</a>).  Matthieu approaches biblical symbolism from a background in computer science and mathematics, focusing on the fractal‑like patterns embedded in Genesis. While his brother emphasizes public teaching, Matthieu describes his work as “internal criticism”; doubting his own interpretations, seeking what he doesn’t yet understand, and allowing reality to correct him. He describes himself as spiritually homeless and is working toward joining the Orthodox or Catholic Church once certain unresolved questions find their answers.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Matthieu’s Top 3 Theses</strong></h2><p><strong>Quick:</strong></p><ol><li><p>Satan is a God‑created <em>function</em> (tester and accuser) that becomes evil only when corrupted by will‑to‑power.</p></li><li><p>The “feminine” principle in biblical symbolism represents renewal, updating, and crowning; Gödel’s incompleteness theorem <em>is</em> Eve’s riddle to Adam.</p></li><li><p>Holy criticism lacks will‑to‑power; fallen criticism seeks dominion; knowing the difference is the key to escaping metaphysical exile.</p></li></ol><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Memorable Quotes <a href="https://youtu.be/UGBec5p7VMU">From The Podcast</a></strong></h2><blockquote><p><em>“God created heaven and earth.
