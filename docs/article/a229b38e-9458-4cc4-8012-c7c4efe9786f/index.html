        <p>Hello friends! On Tuesday, December 2, at 5pm ET, I’ll offer my next live craft lecture for paid subscribers, which will provide overview the publishing process from start to finish, including specific tips on finding agents, writing query letters, and otherwise approaching publishers, as well as what happens once the book has been accepted. (Please note that I had to change the time to 5pm from 7pm, due to a personal conflict. Thanks for understanding!)</p><p>A couple quick bits of housekeeping:</p><ol><li><p>I’m going to start letting people in from the waiting room no sooner than five minutes before the event, and will do my best to start more or less exactly on time. Feel free to join anytime, but know that there may be a short delay letting you in after the event starts, as I’ll likely be talking.</p></li><li><p>Please leave your audio muted unless called upon but feel free to leave your video on, if you’d like. Always good to see some friendly faces! Also, I’ll have the chat active, and I hope you’ll feel free to use it throughout the lecture. (In a respectful, friendly, collegial manner, of course.)</p></li><li><p>I don’t expect to have any issues with this particular audience but obviously I reserve the right to mute or boot anyone who’s being disruptive in any way. <em>Along those lines, please do not share the Zoom information with anyone else. </em>This is part of how we protect the safety and happiness of everyone involved. </p></li><li><p>For anyone who can’t make it, I’ll do my best to remember to record and share the lecture, making it available to watch later for a limited amount of time. </p></li><li><p>Plan on the event lasting 60 minutes or so. </p></li></ol><p>If anyone would still like to join, all you have to do is become a paid subscriber and you’ll have access to the lecture link below. Ready your questions, pour yourself a beverage, keep a notebook or whatever else you need handy. We’ll have fun, I hope! Thank you!</p>
