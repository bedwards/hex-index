And this one is a little bit different.</p><p>For today’s lead story, we asked the outside journalist Andrew Osmond to go on location in Tokyo for us. Specifically, he traveled to Japan’s best stop-motion studio of the moment. We’re excited to share what he learned about the philosophy, style and creative ecosystem that power the team.</p><p>With that, here’s our slate:</p><ul><li><p><strong>1)</strong> Andrew Osmond goes inside dwarf studios.</p></li><li><p><strong>2)</strong> A new film from Estonia.</p></li><li><p><strong>3)</strong> Animation newsbits.</p></li></ul><p>Now, let’s go!</p><h1><strong>1</strong> – A special warmth</h1><p>This September, I visited an animation studio in a Tokyo suburb, a studio far removed from conventional notions of “anime.” It’s dwarf studios — the name is lower case, befitting a company that treads quietly. Founded in 2003, it’s known for soft, gentle, kindhearted films that are exquisite pieces of stop-motion art. Viewers outside Japan are likeliest to recognize it for series like <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru</em> and <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>. </p><p>Dwarf is about an hour’s journey from Tokyo’s central Yamanote Line, and not far from the Sayama Hills — <a href="https://www.totoro.or.jp/totorofund/totoroforest.html">popularized</a> by their connection to <em>My Neighbor Totoro</em>. The building’s in a quiet business area, grassier than Tokyo’s center, with offices and restaurants and a little canal running through it. The only peril is cyclists on the pavements. </p><p>It’s easier for a foreigner to find a studio in Tokyo than it used to be. One of my most shameful memories as a journalist is of being late for an important magazine interview at an anime studio, back in 2001. I was baffled by which train on the relevant Japan Rail line stopped at the station I needed. A quarter-century later, smartphones have made it all a thousand times simpler. </p><p>The dwarf studios building is among the larger ones in its area. Much of its exterior is corrugated metal, and it has the overall impression of a cavernous warehouse, though made friendlier by the dwarf name in lower-case letters over the door. I was there for an appointment to speak with Shuhei Harada, an animator who oversees the studio’s puppet and art production, and producer Yuriko Okada.</p><p>This wasn’t a tour, so I can’t report on what dwarf’s stop-motion characters were up to during my visit. From the evidence of dwarf’s films, though, I’d guess </p>...</source>
