        <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/23/books/review/book-shaped-objects.html?campaign_id=69&amp;emc=edit_bk_20250228&amp;instance_id=148767&amp;nl=books&amp;regi_id=15591747&amp;segment_id=192231&amp;user_id=bf7f3b91a10f13b0459896c7dcbada9d">Hello</a>!</p><p>On a semi-regular basis, I talk to authors about my two favorite topics: reading and writing. This week, I’m excited to share my conversation with Julia Phillips, whose  novels <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/disappearing-earth-julia-phillips/9599330?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwhMq-BhCFARIsAGvo0KfVGfPC6OI6RVFVqr9Si9UXy4aWcInK8BASK9yvK7UdmqklVx76gXMaAvl-EALw_wcB">Disappearing Earth</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/bear-julia-phillips/20650217?ean=9780525520436&amp;next=t">Bear</a></em> I took with me on my family’s road trip through New England last summer. (You can read what I wrote about that experience <a href="https://sarahorman.substack.com/p/two-novels-by-julia-phillips">here</a>.)</p><p>Reading a book is like being invited into the mind of another person. When a book is really working for me, there is often an extra layer of simpatico—a feeling that if I were to meet the author, we would hit it off immediately. I felt that way while I was reading Julia Phillips’ novels. I imagined that if we were to meet in person, we would have so much to talk about that we would keep interrupting each other with stories and book recommendations. I would say that we were “kindred spirits,” and she would know that I was referring to <em>Anne of Green Gables,</em> and then one of us would say “bosom friends,” and we would both laugh. </p><p>I met Julia last November at the Texas Book Festival, and our brief interaction between her panels was exactly as fun and interrupt-y as I hoped it would be. This interview came out of that connection.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg" width="675" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:111016,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://sarahorman.substack.com/i/158804018?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!l8BC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5c6aefb9-dc41-4f2e-9a0b-ae3a01b10f3c_675x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>I want to ask you about fairy tales, because there is this connection in </strong><em><strong>Bear</strong></em><strong> to the Grimm Brothers’ fairy tale, Snow-White and Rose Red, about two sisters who invite a bear into their home. In </strong><em><strong>Bear, </strong></em><strong>you turn the fantasy of a wild animal rescuing the sisters from their life of drudgery on its head. I have read that you lugged a complete Grimms’ Fairy Tales around as a kid. How were you introduced to fairy tales? Were you always aware of their false promises and darker elements?</strong></p><p>The question of introduction is such a good one—it makes me realize I have no idea where that book, or many others on my childhood shelves, came from. I was lucky enough to grow up as the youngest child in a very bookish household. The collection of Grimms’ tales was available for me to grab, along with the Roald Dahl, the Richard Scarry, and a bunch of multicolored encyclopedias for children. I don’t remember them arriving, I just remember them there.</p><p>I certainly was aware of their darkness: they’re so explicitly bloody! Lots of people </p>...</source>
