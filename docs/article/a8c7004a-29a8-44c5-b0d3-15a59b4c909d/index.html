          <strong>Madman theory</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references &#039;madman theory&#039; as a key component of quantum fascism - the deliberate cultivation of unpredictability as a political strategy. Understanding Nixon&#039;s original use of this tactic provides crucial historical context for the author&#039;s argument.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly quotes Arendt&#039;s analysis of totalitarianism and her insight about ideal subjects being those for whom &#039;the distinction between fact and fiction no longer exists.&#039; Her philosophical framework underpins the article&#039;s theoretical argument.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author uses this famous thought experiment as a central metaphor for &#039;quantum fascism&#039; - a government simultaneously fascist and democratic until observed. Understanding the actual physics concept enriches comprehension of the political metaphor.</p>

The official White House X account had just posted a 41-second <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-x-communications-strategy-77c5b1df78278e065fa7221880a063bd">video</a> titled, “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.” Remember it? In the interminable dog years of Trump’s muzzle-velocity presidency, it genuinely feels like a lifetime ago.</p><p>In the clip, shackled immigrants are escorted onto a plane, the sounds of jet engines humming in the background. The post quickly went viral; ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) videos are typically considered calming and indefinably pleasurable, and the video paired that experience with the forced removal of human beings, framing the whole thing as frivolous entertainment—though it was anything but.</p><p>The cruelty and fear tactics have only intensified in the intervening months. We see it in the disappearing of individuals with no due process, starting with voices calling for an end to the genocide in Gaza (notably Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Öztürk, along with many others); then the revoking international student <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/us-immigration-news-more-500-international-student-visas-revoked-donald-trump-admin-expands-reasons-deportation/16160825/">visas</a> under similiar auspices; and the brutalization of thousands of both American citizens and immigrants—the latter of whom have been sent to horrific detention centers ranging from Florida’s ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ to Ecuador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT—a megajail which has been called a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-conditions-inside-the-infamous-el-salvador-prison-where-deported-migrants-are-held">gulag</a>—unconscionable in its own right but worse so because many of these people were following the prescribed legal pathway to secure American citizenship.</p><p>These efforts have been colored by what we might <em>charitably</em> call incompetence, such as the high-profile deportation of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-hearing-arguments-deportation-maryland-man-el-salvador/story?id=120491918">Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia</a> “because of an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/01/politics/maryland-father-mistakenly-deported-el-salvador-prison/index.html">administrative error</a>”—but the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/abrego-garcia-trump-deportations-el-salvador.html">following attempt</a> to brand him as a criminal and re-deport him tells us that even this “incompetence” is being weaponized as part of an explicit, intentional bid to simply terrorize immigrants.</p><p>Though the DOGE frenzy has died down, this “agency” also embodied this spirit: first in its trollish name, then with Elon Musk’s “smash it with a hammer” approach to government “efficiency” (which was anything <em>but </em>efficient, and is now believed to have caused over <a href="https://www.impactcounter.com/dashboard?view=table&amp;sort=interval_minutes&amp;order=asc">600,000 deaths</a> worldwide, including over 400,000 children—and furthermore is projected to cause as many as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths">14 million deaths</a> through it’s cuts to USAID alone).</p><p>Most recently, we see it in the rebranding of the Department of Defense to the <a href="https://www.realitystudies.co/p/the-department-of-war-gaza-ukraine-imperial-boomerang">Department of War</a>, under whose banner Pete Hegseth and Trump have occupied American cities that they call “enemies,” and branded essentially anyone who disagrees with their policies as terrorists.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;3b6be781-f588-43a6-980d-c90ae394db8c&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Welcome to the Urgent Futures podcast, the show that finds {signals} in the noise.
