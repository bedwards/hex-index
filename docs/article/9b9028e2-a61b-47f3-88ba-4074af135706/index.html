If you’ve found your way over by some miracle but are not yet subscribed, here, let me help you with that:</em></p><p><em>I’ve been determined to avoid wearing maternity clothes for as long as I’m able, which at 7+ months pregnant is becoming less and less possible by the day. To give you a sense of what I’m working with because I’m often asked based on my recommendations and what might work for others: I’m 5’9”, usually wear a size 8/10, my torso is long and I almost always wear larger bottoms than tops. The following tale of “maternity dressing” is for my body and what works for me– one persons account of getting dressed during this time.</em></p><p>If this were the summer or spring or even fall, I’d probably just wear dresses and loose fitting flowy garments, but it’s winter. I must be warm, I need to be cozy. Unfortunately, I need pants. I’ve tried the “just size up” method of new and old/vintage denim, but end up looking and feeling sloppy– they really just don’t quite fit. I’ve also tried the “loop the hair tie onto the button” trick, which worked twice, but not before and not after those two times. Finally, I’m sad to report after a few failed attempts, maternity jeans (even “the best ones”) just simply are not for me. They feel like fake pants– the over the belly ones feature horrible bands of fabric meant to stretch over a giant belly (not a feature of regular pants) above a set of “buttons” (not real buttons) starting well below the usual place. The below the belly sit so far below the belly I feel unsafe, exposed and spilling out every which way like the Gen Z I am not. I understand some people love maternity jeans and feel confident and attractive in them– I can not relate.</p><p>I admit the one piece of “maternity wear” that I am truly loving are…the leggings (boring!). After trying and failing to make “regular” leggings work, I understood I really did need the extra fabric. Now, I’m in a fully committed relationship with a leggings-based lifestyle— This makes me feel both comfortable and like I’ve given something up. <a href="https://www.hatchcollection.com/products/the-ultra-soft-before-during-after-maternity-legging?srsltid=AfmBOoq8TXrfGaPmZnTGOWwxxbzy-KVZ3i-vMdajsw5wwk7ZkdjggqJw">These</a> and <a href="https://www.hatchcollection.com/products/the-maternity-ultimate-before-during-after-crop-flare-legging?variant=42308958716081?color=black">these</a> are my favorite and I wear them nearly every day, which is easy because they go with everything I already own.</p><p>Of course, there </p>...</source>
