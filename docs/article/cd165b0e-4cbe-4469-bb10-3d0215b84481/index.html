His voice was on the cusp of changing, and he expected to rehearse the usual Sunday hymns.</p><p>Instead, he and his fellow choristers were unexpectedly driven across the Golden Gate Bridge to a San Francisco recording studio. “We walked in and they handed us the lyrics to ‘Christmas Time Is Here,’” said Willat, now a retired police officer who volunteers as a docent at the <a href="https://schulzmuseum.org/">Charles M. Schulz Museum</a> in Santa Rosa, Calif., — the <em>Peanuts</em> creator’s home town. “And then they said, ‘This is for a <em>Peanuts</em> special.’”</p><p>That impromptu recording session produced one of the most enduring songs of the holiday season. Sixty years later, composer Vince Guaraldi’s <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> soundtrack remains <a href="https://www.grammy.com/videos/charlie-brown-christmas-vince-guaraldi-trio-record">one of the bestselling holiday and jazz albums</a> of all time.</p><p>But the path to creating this classic wasn’t smooth.</p><p>Guaraldi had originally conceived “Christmas Time Is Here” as an instrumental piece. In a 2003 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkZu5H4Wb_M">interview</a> with the Television Academy, producer Lee Mendelson talked about his last-minute decision to add lyrics: “I just scribbled some words down on an envelope — ‘Christmas time is here, happiness’ and so forth, and never thought much about it.”</p><p>The children didn’t nail the downbeat song on the first try. Rehearsal outtakes reveal multiple flubs and false starts, with the producer calling out “Never mind!” and “Take six!” A <a href="https://vinceguaraldi.bandcamp.com/album/a-charlie-brown-christmas-super-deluxe-edition-2">2022 edition</a> of the album includes material from seven takes. But Willat says there could have been more. The young singers can be heard collapsing into giggles between attempts.</p><p>After the session, the children were sent back across the Golden Gate Bridge with ice cream in their bellies and $5 in their pockets. But there was a problem: They arrived late to their church, and many of their parents had no idea where they’d been.</p><p>“They get there. The church is dark, no kids,” Willat says. “Imagine that happening today!”</p><p>Some understandably upset parents refused to sign the necessary releases allowing their children's voices to appear on the soundtrack.
