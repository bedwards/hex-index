        <p class="topic-summary">Vulcan Elements produces rare-earth magnets central to the $620M Pentagon loan. Understanding rare-earth elements—their strategic importance, mining challenges, China&#039;s near-monopoly on production, and military applications—provides crucial context for why the Defense Department would invest so heavily in domestic production.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Large Pentagon loans to small domestic companies for strategic materials like rare-earth magnets typically flow through Defense Production Act authorities. This Cold War-era law explains the legal mechanism enabling such government investments in private industry for national security purposes.</p>

Trump Jr. was given <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-drones-pentagon.html">200,000 shares of the company’s stock</a> in 2024, which are now worth millions.</p><p>Now, another small startup funded by 1789 Capital, a venture capital firm where Trump Jr. is a partner, will receive a $620 million loan from the Defense Department, the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/952f37ba-78b4-42a4-8d1b-2258de65f2c0">reported</a>. Vulcan Elements, which currently has around 30 employees, produces rare-earth magnets, which can be used in “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-26/malik-s-1789-said-to-back-defense-rare-earth-magnet-startups">drones, radar systems and other military applications</a>.” The contract was awarded just three months after 1789 invested in Vulcan.</p><p>The loan is part of a larger $1.4 billion deal <a href="https://vulcanelements.com/vulcan-elements-forges-1-4-billion/">announced last month</a> that also involves another company, ReElement Technologies. It also <a href="https://vulcanelements.com/vulcan-elements-forges-1-4-billion/">includes</a> $50 million from the Commerce Department and $550 million from private investors. In exchange, the “Department of Commerce will receive $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements.” The Department of Defense will receive warrants for Vulcan Elements — an option to buy a stake in the future — according to a <a href="https://vulcanelements.com/vulcan-elements-forges-1-4-billion/">press release</a>.</p><p>Both Vulcan CEO John Maslin and Unusual Machines CEO Allan Evans said that Trump Jr. played no role in securing the government contracts. According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/952f37ba-78b4-42a4-8d1b-2258de65f2c0">Financial Times</a>, “[a]t least four of 1789’s portfolio companies have won contracts from the Trump administration this year, amounting to more than $735 million.”</p><p>Trump Jr. “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/us/politics/trump-drones-pentagon.html">helped screen candidates for top jobs at the Pentagon on behalf of his father after the election</a>.” In September, Trump Jr. said on his podcast that he looked for candidates who wanted to spend more on drones, alleging that the military is “better served with a drone that costs… a tiny fraction of that of a plane.” During the nomination process, Trump Jr. was also an outspoken defender of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who later <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/10/2003752117/-1/-1/1/UNLEASHING-U.S.-MILITARY-DRONE-DOMINANCE.PDF">issued several directives</a> that enabled the Pentagon to increase spending on drones.</p><div><hr></div><h1><strong>Trump </strong></h1>...</source>
