become a practice during Advent and Christmas. </a></strong>Which Christmas songs could be yodeled?</p><blockquote><p>GENEVA (AP) — Switzerland’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-yodeling-unesco-9db642e20b4cc36c94639edc8ec9d314">long-celebrated yodeling</a> has received a response from <a href="https://apnews.com/article/what-is-unesco-explainer-us-funding-6797042db1016bacf0d522366dbe809a">the U.N. cultural agency</a>: The Alpine tradition of chant and song is indeed worthy of classification in a list of the world’s cultural heritage.</p><p>A committee of Paris-based UNESCO, meeting in New Delhi, on Thursday listed yodeling in its list of intangible cultural heritage.</p><p>Yodeling was selected among <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/intangible-cultural-heritage/committee-2025">67 traditions</a> honored by UNESCO in the Indian capital, including <a href="https://the%20u.n.xn--'s%20cultural%20agency%20gave%20foodies%20on%20wednesday%20another%20reason%20to%20celebrate%20their%20pizza,%20pasta%20and%20tiramisu%20by%20listing%20italian%20cooking%20as%20part%20of%20the%20worlds%20intangible%20cultural%20heritage-2e97msuazh./">Italian cooking</a>, Ghanaian highlife music, the fermented Kyrgyz beverage Maksym and the El Joropo music and dance tradition in Venezuela.</p><p>The list is different from the UNESCO World Heritage List, which enshrines protections for physical sites that are considered important to humanity, like the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pyramid-egypt-cairo-chamber-antiquities-c104c9479b110b85567e61b9ee4bcc0e">Pyramids of Giza in Egypt</a>.</p><p>“Yodeling can be performed by individuals, small groups or choirs, and sometimes with instruments like the accordion,” said UNESCO.</p><p>“It features rich harmonics and is often performed at concerts, parties and competitions, with participants typically wearing traditional regional costumes,” the assessment said.</p><p>Switzerland’s government pushed the candidacy with UNESCO, and promoters insist it’s far more than the mountain cries of yesteryear by falsetto-bellowing male herders in suspenders on green mountainsides: It’s also a popular form of singing.</p><p>The government says at least 12,000 yodelers take part through about 780 groups of the Swiss Yodeling Association.</p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://christianscholars.com/professing-in-an-age-of-therapeutic-rage-a-lamentation/">Olga Dielin reflects</a></strong> on how we speak of the recently dead:</p><blockquote><p>When I asked why many Protestants lamented the death of Pope Francis but scorned MacArthur’s, someone offered a blunt explanation: “Because MacArthur was a misogynist jerk.” Yet Pope Francis held an even more restrictive view on women’s ordination, a stance solidified by last week’s <a

commission vote against women deacons.</a> His Holiness was perceived as kind; MacArthur, as harsh. By contrast, John Glass, friend and missionary pastor in Switzerland, posted this tribute: “All I can do is thank the Lord for having allowed me to know John MacArthur, not only as a great and influential expositor, but also as a kind, gracious, and gentle man.</p><p>Then, within hours of Dobson’s death, social media filled with voices denouncing his views.
