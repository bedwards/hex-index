        <p>My book, <em><a href="https://chrissmaje.com/book/finding-lights-in-a-dark-age/">Finding Lights in a Dark Age: Sharing Land, Work and Craft</a></em>, is officially published today in the UK (US publication is 11 November). It’s available in paperback, e-book and audiobook versions. There’s a launch this evening at the town hall in Frome, my hometown. It’s fully booked, which is nice.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg" width="1000" height="1500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1500,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UJ42!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0cb154b4-a14d-41d1-832d-ed0536b8da21_1000x1500.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I wrote a little bit about the book <a href="https://chrissmaje.com/2025/05/finding-lights-in-a-dark-age-or-writing-%e1%bc%80%cf%80%ce%bf%ce%ba%ce%ac%ce%bb%cf%85%cf%88%ce%b9%cf%82/">here</a>. I’ll start a short-to-medium length cycle of blog posts about it soon, but I think not immediately. At least that will give those who read my online posts and are planning to read the book a chance to get stuck in before I offer my meta-commentary. And I have a few more posts on other matters in the pipeline.</p><p>I’m thinking of <em>Finding Lights… </em>as the third and final book in a trilogy that I’ve published with Chelsea Green. Maybe it helps to introduce it in relation to those books. In <em>A Small Farm Future</em> I explained the crises or driving forces that I believe are impelling us away from globalised state welfare capitalism, and further explained why these forces will impel us toward small-scale farming and agrarian localism. To quote the chair of the Federal Communications Commission, I believe we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Though actually, I don’t think the easy way is any longer an option. We can do it in hard ways or harder ways, but a small farm future seems like a given. I’m just trying to highlight the hard ways we might achieve it, to help avoid the even harder ones.</p><p>In <em>Saying NO to a Farm-Free Future</em>, I tried to warn against the siren song of ecomodernism, specifically in the farming and energy sectors. Ecomodernism has been aptly defined as “a movement that treats green technology as a <em>substitute</em> for political and economic change” and indeed there is a narrative style in the book and policy worlds which involves scaring the hell out of us with terrible future scenarios before pulling a rabbit out of a hat with some high-tech, high-energy new gizmology which supposedly will preserve high-energy urban civilization with little fundamental political and economic change. The touted gizmologies rarely stand up to scrutiny (the fanfares for the manufactured bacterial food that I critiqued in that book have already pretty much faded to black just two years later), but alas people keep falling </p>...</source>
