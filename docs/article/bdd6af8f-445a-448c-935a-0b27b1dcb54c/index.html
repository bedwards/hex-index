          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Hickel explicitly discusses how high-income economies rely on &#039;massive net-appropriation from the global South&#039; and mentions overcoming &#039;unequal exchange and imperialist dynamics&#039; as a key challenge for degrowth theory. Understanding the economic theory behind unequal exchange provides essential context for his argument.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The steady-state economy is the foundational economic concept underlying degrowth theory. While the interview discusses degrowth extensively, readers would benefit from understanding the earlier theoretical framework developed by economists like Herman Daly that degrowth builds upon.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Hickel critiques &#039;left-productivism&#039; as a strain of socialist thought that &#039;ignores imperialism and ignores ecology.&#039; Understanding productivism as an ideology helps readers grasp the specific intellectual tradition degrowth is arguing against within socialist discourse.</p>
