Experiencing a tumultuous childhood after his parents' divorce, he found solace in therapy. Acknowledging the profound impact it had on his life sparked his interest in neuroscience, leading him to earn a master's in neurobiology and behavior at UC Berkeley and a PhD at UC Davis. Now a <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/andrew-huberman">professor in the neurobiology department at Stanford School of Medicine</a>, Huberman has significantly contributed to research in brain development, function, and neural plasticity.</p><p>During his tenure at Stanford, Huberman noticed the mental health crisis exacerbated by COVID, and the failure of health authorities to provide holistic guidance to improve public well-being. It sparked him to start the <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast">Huberman Lab podcast</a> in January 2021, offering a voice of scientific authority in a noisy internet filled with questionable health claims.</p><h4><em><strong>The HubermanLab podcast</strong></em></h4><p>In each of his episode, which often run 2 to 3h long, Huberman meticulously breaks down a single scientific topic, either solo or with a distinguished academic guest with the “Huberman” style: breaking down dense topics, and speaking like a human footnote, rattling off study citations, carefully contextualizing research findings. His discussions, which cover diverse subjects like dopamine, strength training, or anxiety, delve into how science informs our approach to sleep, nutrition, exercise, and mental health.</p><p>3h-long scientific podcasts are not an obvious recipe for success at a time when&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5878780/how-to-focus-covid-19-pandemic/">attention spans </a></p>...</source>
