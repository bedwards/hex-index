        <p>I read Septology by Jon Fosse at the start of this year. I was excited to read it but I saved it as a treat for a while. I have loved the shorter works by Fosse that I have read. I find his writing so distinctive and funny and fresh and real, totally free of what my friend Nicole Flattery calls “emotional contrivances” (“I lay on the floor and I wept and I wept”, “I found out about a traumatic event and I couldn’t get over it”, “he or she was my tormentor”) or overzealous thesaurus usage or humour which signposts itself so heavily it is simply not funny.</p><p>Septology was no different. I don’t need to recommend it, he did just win the Nobel prize. But I thought I would say it is funny and fresh because work like this, which uses a different convention of syntax or grammar, tends to be described as challenging. I don’t agree, I think people adjust to the meaning of a new convention of full stops or commas or whatever after a few pages. Didn’t we all learn to read in the first place because we have the ability to do this?</p><p>It is sometimes said in reviews that Fosse is hard to quote. Septology is told in eight units that each unfold over a single sentence. But obviously when writers do this the comma naturally serves a similar function to a full stop in some or many cases. Likewise there are a lot of young writers working at the minute who don’t really use commas very much at all, and in their work full stops have a comma-like role in some or many cases. I suppose the idea, though, is that the meandering character of his prose is hard to capture over a short quote. I actually don’t agree with this. Here is one which I think works well to show the humour and freshness:</p><blockquote><p>“... the woman who’d lived with a fiddler who eventually just drank all the time and she told him to leave and he did which she’s really regretted since then…”</p></blockquote><p>I think that “challenging” label can put people who would enjoy certain books a great deal off reading them. There is a great scene in Septology which I read as being about this actually. A boy who has been a bad student and a delinquent talks about ...</p>
