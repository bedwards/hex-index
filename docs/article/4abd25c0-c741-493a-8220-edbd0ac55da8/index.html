        <p>By Jen Ellis</p><p><em>With 25 years in global missions leadership and first hand experience of moral injury, Jen Ellis works as a speaker and trainer, equipping healthcare and other frontline professionals to build trustworthy teams, navigate brokenness wisely, and lead with lasting influence.</em></p><p>Hindsight continues to be one of the most effective teachers in my life.
