        <p>For years, IKEA avoided Brazil. High import taxes, complex logistics, and bureaucracy made the country a retail nightmare.</p><p>Two <em>Emerging Markets Today</em> stories — <em>“<a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/no-ikea-in-brazil/">No IKEA in Brazil</a>”</em> and <em>“<a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/why-brazil-still-is-a-no-go-for-ikea/">Why Brazil Still Is a No-Go for IKEA</a>”</em> — explained why the Swedish giant stayed away while expanding across Mexico, Chile, and Colombia.</p><p>That hasn’t changed. There are still no IKEA stores in Brazil. But the company has finally put money into the country — not for furniture, but for forests.</p><p>Inter IKEA Group is investing <strong><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/corporate/inter-ikea-group-announces-forest-investment-in-brazil-251106/">€100 million</a></strong><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/corporate/inter-ikea-group-announces-forest-investment-in-brazil-251106/"> in a </a><strong><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/corporate/inter-ikea-group-announces-forest-investment-in-brazil-251106/">forest-based carbon-removal project</a></strong><a href="https://www.ikea.com/global/en/newsroom/corporate/inter-ikea-group-announces-forest-investment-in-brazil-251106/"> </a>in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest biome. Around <strong>4,000 hectares</strong> of degraded pastureland in Paraná and Santa Catarina will be restored with a mix of native species and FSC-certified pine plantations. The project is developed with <strong>BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group</strong>, one of Latin America’s largest sustainable asset managers.</p><p>The move aligns with new EU climate-reporting rules pushing companies to prove measurable carbon-removal results. Brazil, with vast degraded land and biodiversity potential, offers a natural testing ground for these investments.</p><p>For IKEA, this is a low-risk way to engage with Brazil without facing its costly retail system. For Brazil, it shows how <strong>nature is turning into an economic asset</strong>.</p><p>A growing local ecosystem of banks, asset managers, and verification startups is helping scale forest-restoration projects like this. As Brazil prepares to launch a regulated carbon market, these efforts could become a new export industry — one based on carbon removal rather than commodities.</p><p>IKEA still won’t sell a Billy shelf in São Paulo. But it finally has something growing in Brazilian soil.</p><h2>Meanwhile in Belém, COP30 is happening.</h2><p>The timing of IKEA’s forest investment couldn’t be more symbolic.</p><p>Yesterday, <strong>COP 30</strong> opened in <strong>Belém</strong>, deep in the Amazon—the first climate summit ever hosted in the rainforest region.</p><p><strong>President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong> used the stage to warn that <em>“Earth can no longer sustain the development model based on the intensive use of fossil fuels that has prevailed over the past 200 years.”</em> He called this meeting the <em>“COP of truth”</em> — the moment for the world to decide whether this century will be defined by climate catastrophe or by reconstruction.</p><p>He also urged wealthier nations to deliver the long-promised <strong>US $1.3 trillion</strong> in climate finance, reminding delegates that <em>“we need a roadmap to undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources </em>...</p>
