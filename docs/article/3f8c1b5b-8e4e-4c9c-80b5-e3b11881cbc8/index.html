It wasn’t easy. Our small team worked tirelessly to ensure we didn’t miss a day. Our producers, editors, and fact checkers scoured government websites, officials’ social media, news reports, and court records, to not only document the attacks on democracy that made the front page, but also to highlight the actions that didn’t get the coverage it would have received under any other president.</p><p>Our goal: To ensure there would be a historical record of this dark time; to not normalize Trump and his administration’s extreme rhetoric and actions; and to provide a resource for anyone struggling to keep track of many, many ways the administration is threatening their rights.</p><p>While we wish there was no need for this project, we are incredibly proud of this work. What we produced is unlike any other piece of journalism published by mainstream and independent media alike. If you put the <strong>52 weeks</strong> of ‘This Week in Democracy’ together, it would include more than <strong>3,740 items </strong>totalling over <strong>168,000 words</strong>. Each week averaged more than <strong>73 bullet points.</strong> <strong><a href="https://zeteo.com/p/this-week-in-democracy-week-10-trump-signal-waltz">Week 10</a></strong> – the week of Signalgate and when Rümeysa Öztürk was detained by plainclothes ICE agents over an op-ed – had the longest list, nearly <strong>100 items</strong>.</p><p>Moving forward, ‘This Week in Democracy’ will look different. Starting next week, we will highlight only the single worst attack on democracy for each day. It will hit your inbox on Fridays, not Saturdays. <strong>Zeteo</strong>, however, remains committed to documenting, in detail, the growth of authoritarianism in the US – through the important reporting of our politics team, <strong>Mehdi’s</strong> hard-hitting interviews, the smart analysis of our contributors, and via our new morning newsletter, ‘<a href="https://zeteo.com/s/first-draft">First Draft</a>’ (have you signed up for that yet?). </p><p>If you’re not </p>...</source>
