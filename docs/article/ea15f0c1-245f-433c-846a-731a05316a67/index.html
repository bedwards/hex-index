          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article explores how individual readers construct meaning and taste through their reading experiences. Reader-response criticism is the literary theory framework that explains why the same book can work for one reader but not another, directly relevant to the author&#039;s thesis about learning from books we don&#039;t enjoy.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The author explicitly mentions &#039;resisting FOMO&#039; when it comes to popular books. FOMO is a well-documented psychological phenomenon with interesting research on social media, consumer behavior, and how it drives people to make choices against their actual preferences.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The entire article centers on discerning personal literary taste and what makes certain books work for certain readers. Understanding the history and philosophy of how literary taste has been theorized—from classical aesthetics to modern criticism—provides valuable context for the reader&#039;s self-reflection journey.</p>
