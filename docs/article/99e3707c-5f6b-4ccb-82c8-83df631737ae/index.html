I’m Stephen West. This is <em>Philosophize This!</em></p><p>So there’s a quote from one of the members of the Kyoto School that we’re going to be talking about today.</p><p>He said, <em>“Religion without philosophy is blind, and philosophy without religion is vacuous.”</em></p><p>We’re going to be talking about the relationship between philosophy and religion, something many members of the Kyoto School were always rethinking and developing as they were doing their work.</p><p>I highly recommend reading the two posts we’ve done so far on Keiji Nishitani. Just a heads up, I’ll be using terms like Sunyata and referencing concepts from his work throughout this post.</p><p>But all that said, I don’t even want to start with Nishitani or anyone from the Kyoto School for that matter. Today I want to start with something simple. I want to give some long-deserved attention to a very important cartoon character that’s come to be known as the duck-rabbit.</p><p>Who or what is a duck-rabbit, you may ask.</p><p>You ever seen one of those optical illusion things where half of the people that look at it see a duck and the other half see a rabbit?</p><p>There are tons of these things out there. It can be a sound. It can be a video. But the point is, aside from this just being some fun optical illusion on a kids’ menu at a restaurant, these are things that can show us something important about the way we see the world as human beings.</p><p>Ludwig Wittgenstein used the duck-rabbit in his work to talk about the meaning of words. But the duck-rabbit as a metaphor can actually be useful for all sorts of situations when we want to get out of seeing things in a classic, dualistic, abstract framing of the world, like we’ve been talking about in these posts lately.</p><p>And I’d like to take this moment to empathize with a certain kind of person out there reading this series so far.</p><p>This kind of person may say, “Look, I hear you. You keep talking about these different framings of our reality. One is a rational, utilitarian framing, where we create systems out of abstractions, I get that one.</p><p>But then you start talking about this phenomenological framing, sometimes you even say <em>embodied</em> or <em>religious</em> framing, where apparently in <em>this</em> type of awareness, we’re not breaking things down in this theoretical way anymore. </p>...</source>
