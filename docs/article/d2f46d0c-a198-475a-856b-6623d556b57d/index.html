At the strategic level, this means no longer simply defending China’s borders and passively responding to threats but rather actively building and shaping a military posture around China’s periphery that can adequately respond to China’s perceived threats. The implementation of this guidance can be seen in China’s more assertive military posture in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. <strong><a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Dec/23/2003849070/-1/-1/1/ANNUAL-REPORT-TO-CONGRESS-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA-2025.PDF">Report to Congress on Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2025</a></strong></em></p></div><p>On 29 December, just as the summit between President’s Zelenskyy and Trump was finishing at Mar-a-lago, and hundreds of journalists were filing their initial analyses of the meeting, the Peoples Liberation Army Eastern Theatre Command announced that it had <a href="https://www.twz.com/news-features/china-launches-snap-warning-drills-around-taiwan-simulating-a-total-blockade">commenced exercise "Justice Mission 2025"</a> in the Taiwan Strait. </p><p>Similar to other joint exercises conducted in 2025 and 2024, this was an activity to rehearse future military campaigns to “shield” Taiwan from outside military forces that might come to its aid.  At the same time, the bottom of the shields in the PLA posters for the exercise are shaped like blades. This is intended by the Chinese to “cut off the delusional dream of Taiwan independence.”  Thus, Justice Mission 2025 is intended to project the image of an advanced, capable PLA that can both attack Taiwan while fending off assistance from the military forces of America, Japan and elsewhere.</p><p>The exercise is rehearsing a range of military activities and features live fire drills.</p><p>The exercise is one of President Xi’s ways of demonstrating his <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5666571-china-taiwan-us-arms-sale/">displeasure</a> at the 17 December 2025 announcement by the U.S. government of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-us-has-initiated-111-billion-arms-sale-procedure-2025-12-18/">massive weapons sale to Taiwan</a>. With a value of US$11.1 billion, this is the largest single U.S. sale to Taiwan in history, and includes highly symbolic weapon systems such as the HIMARS long-range precision strike system. </p><p>Finally, we should not discount that Justice Mission 2025 is also designed to message <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/offhand-remark-symbolic-suit-signal-long-winter-japan-china-ties-2025-11-20/">China’s continuing displeasure with Japan</a>.
