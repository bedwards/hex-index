It was a wonderful whirlwind of a journey and had a great time. I received a great deal of ideas for videos and will be working on them over the next few weeks. The trip had many upsides - sorry I didn’t organize any meetups as I was too tired - but the highlight was undoubtedly this trip to ASML. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>I recently had the opportunity to visit ASML's headquarters in the small village of Veldhoven in the Netherlands. </p><p>It was a wonderful experience. I learned a lot about the company's history, culture, and more. </p><p>And I was honored to have the rare opportunity to see the $300 million or whatever High-NA EUV tool. I call it the Beast. </p><p>So in this short video, just a few random thoughts on seeing ASML in the flesh. </p><h2>Eindhoven</h2><p>My hotel was in Eindhoven, which is short ways near Veldhoven. </p><p>The town is quite nice, albeit rather slow-paced. By the way. For what it is worth, I paid my own way including transportation and hotel stay. And ASML did not sponsor this video. </p><p>Eindhoven will forever be known as the home of Philips, the once-massive consumer electronics tech giant. </p><p>They first built the lithography machine technology and later spun off ASML as a joint venture with ASM International. </p><p>They were also TSMC's cornerstone foreign investor, owning 28% of the company at the start and 36% later on. </p><p>Philips later sold off all the shares they got from both those efforts. As of this writing, the two companies have a combined market capitalization of $1 trillion. Would have been nice to have those stakes now. </p><p>But such is life. Investment managers in the mid-1990s were pressuring Philips to sell those stakes to "unlock" shareholder value. </p><h2>ASML in Veldhoven</h2><p>Over the past five years, ASML has grown incredibly fast in almost every possible way. </p><p>For instance, the stock has gone nuts - to the utter surprise of virtually everyone who has ever worked at the company. </p><p>The company has gained a huge and unexpected new following in the popular consciousness. That includes a great deal of people who believe that the company's products make chips right out of the box like a pasta machine. Not the case, by the way. </p><p>And then headcount. Today the company has ...</p>
