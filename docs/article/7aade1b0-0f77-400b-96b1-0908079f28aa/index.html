        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday.

The plan covers the construction of 29 new vessels, with deliveries beginning in April 2027 and extending through late 2028. The ships will feature advanced designs to reduce energy use and emissions, with several vessels equipped to run on alternative fuels such as methanol and ammonia. COSCO’s leadership has long emphasized dual-fuel readiness as a cornerstone of its sustainability roadmap, and this latest move reinforces that message.

With most indicators that define seafarers’ lives in decline, the index shows that the average happiness level has plunged to 7.05 out of 10 in the third quarter of 2025. This is a sharp decline from 7.54 in the previous quarter. Seafarers are also expressing frustration with wages, which they say remain stagnant despite increased responsibilities, inflation, and the demanding nature of seagoing life. On health and exercise, they contend that operational pressures are increasingly compromising their ability to maintain their physical fitness and overall health.

This plan is to open two new distribution centers and expand an existing warehouse that handles specialty drugs over the next five years. Half of the new medicines hitting the global market from 2023 to 2027 are expected to require cold storage, up from 37% of products launched between 2013 and 2017. Cencora today a national distribution center in Lockbourne, Ohio. Drug manufacturers ship truckloads of their products to that warehouse, where shipments are broken down into smaller quantities and sent to other facilities throughout the U.S. that handle final-mile delivery. The company plans to open a second national distribution center about 120 miles southwest in Harrison, Ohio, by ...</p>
