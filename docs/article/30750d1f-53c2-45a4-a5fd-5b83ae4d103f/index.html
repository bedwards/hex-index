        <p><em>I have <a href="https://www.tangledwilderness.org/shop/p/hurrah-anarchy-double-zine">a new zine</a> out as of today, a fancy double-sided, double-zine that collects my essays “Hurrah for Anarchy: A History of May Day, Haymarket, and the Chicago Anarchists” and “Anarchism &amp; Its Misunderstanders: On Supply Chains &amp; Buried History.” It’s one zine on one side, another one when you turn it over. And it’s gorgeous, with an offset printed cover done by Eberhardt Press. This photo doesn’t do the metallic ink justice.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://www.tangledwilderness.org/shop/p/hurrah-anarchy-double-zine" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png" width="916" height="724" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:724,&quot;width&quot;:916,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1160144,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.tangledwilderness.org/shop/p/hurrah-anarchy-double-zine&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://margaretkilljoy.substack.com/i/170108041?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!p0Ow!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa89a94e1-81e2-4703-9b4c-de45cd27bab3_916x724.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>I’ll be at the <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackcatbookfair/">Black Cat Book Fair</a></strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackcatbookfair/"> </a>in <strong>Belfast</strong>, <strong>Maine</strong> on <strong>August 23rd</strong>, tabling for Strangers in a Tangled Wilderness and giving some sort of talk.</em></p><p><em>This week’s Cool People Who Did Cool Stuff episode is about Indymedia, the volunteer media collective who changed the way the internet worked (for better and worse) while developing methods by which to cover protests.</em></p><p><em>I’ve been working on recording audiobooks for the Danielle Cain series, and I’m hoping to have more updates about that for you soon.</em></p><h1>The Witch Who Cured My Nightmares</h1><p>Last night, in the middle of some other, much nicer dreams, I dreamt of being herded into a building by riot police, who then tried to break in, armed and screaming.</p><p>I used to have nightmares about police chasing me, every night, decades ago. It went on for months, and every night I woke up panting with fear or exhaustion, because I’d just been running, and the cops had just caught me.</p><p>I was twenty years old at the time, and I spent most of my days organizing anti-war protests in Portland and most of my nights riding a bike around from dumpster to dumpster looking for food. In my dreams, maybe I was shoplifting, or maybe I was dumpster diving, or maybe I was at a protest, or maybe I was just walking down the street, and a cop or cops would come for me. I would run, or I would bike, and they would run after me, or they would drive after me, and I could never get away.</p><p>I figured, when I was twenty, that I’d be dead or in prison by the time I was thirty.
