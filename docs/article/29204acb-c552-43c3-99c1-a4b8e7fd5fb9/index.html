Will getting another degree help me with my career goals? What should I expect my life to be like during grad school? How will grad studies be different from my undergrad degree? What should I know about grad school before making this decision?</p><p>To answer these questions and to make progress towards demystifying grad studies, it is important that we give a voice not only to those who are asking the questions, but to those who have experienced it already. In this article, I interviewed students from three different levels of familiarity with grad school and compared their expectations and experiences to get a clearer picture of what grad school is all about.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Level 1 – Undergraduate Student</strong></h2><p><em>Clara Argentino </em>is a third year undergraduate Student at McMaster University working towards a BSc.

For example, it’s unclear to me if you apply to a school you’re interested in, and THEN find a supervisor, or is it the other way around?”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“My biggest concern about grad school is probably dealing with “imposter syndrome” which is something I struggle with even now. I hope I can gain confidence in grad school and get over this feeling.”</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>What do you think of the work-life balance of a grad student?
