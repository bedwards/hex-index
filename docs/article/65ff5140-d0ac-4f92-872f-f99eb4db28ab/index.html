        <p>Readers, I hope you had a happy Thanksgiving if you’re in the U.S. or an otherwise wonderful week if not. We had a great time with family on the east coast. Louise is enthralled with her cousins and getting to see her relationships with them deepen over visits is a true delight. </p><p>This year, I’m feeling particularly thankful for this community of readers and the work I get to do. Even though there are frustrating or annoying aspects of my job as there are with any job, I feel lucky every day to get to do this work and spend my time talking about books with all of you. I’ve been mulling over what else I want to bring to this space in the new year, and I’m really excited to start letting you in on that in the coming weeks. <strong>But one small thing I’d like to implement is being more direct about asking you what you read or are reading this week. I’ll be including this question at the end of “This Week in Books” each Sunday, and I do hope you’ll make use of it!</strong> I would love to chat more about books in the comments, get to know all of you better as readers, and get some recommendations for my own TBR!</p><div><hr></div><h3>This week in books.</h3><p><em><strong>This week I read…</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Lost Children Archive </strong></em><strong>by Valeria Luiselli. </strong>One downside of reading so much and working in the book world, is I can start to feel like I’ve read books I haven’t.

It’s a strange mental deception that has kept me from reading some books I’ll surely love and that will surely surprise me, which is exactly what happened with <em>Lost Children Archive</em>. Thank goodness I finally got over my block and selected this for the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/fictionmatters">FictionMatters Book Club</a> because I thought it was exceptional.</p><p>This novel begins with a family—a single mother with a daughter who meets, falls in love with, and marries a single father of a son. For many years, the mother and father have worked together recording and documenting the sounds of New York City, but the father has a growing interest in Apache history and wants to travel to Arizona ...</p>
