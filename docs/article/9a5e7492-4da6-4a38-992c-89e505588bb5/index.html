Commonly mentioned causes of economic growth are institutions (forms of government and laws) and overall knowledge accumulation.</p><p><a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/7312037d-2b2d-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b/content">Aghion and Howitt (1992)</a> (“<strong>AH</strong>”) looked at knowledge accumulation through the lens of technological adoption and obsolescence. Many new technologies often fully replace former technologies – like email replacing the fax machine, or online streaming replacing DVDs.</p><p>This type of technological development leads to economic gains – higher efficiency – but the process itself results in certain losers (fax makers and DVD producers no longer exist). The discovery of new technologies that replace old ones is known as “creative destruction”, a term popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter">Joseph Schumpeter</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“The fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets,... [This process] incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism”</p></blockquote><h4>Creative Destruction</h4><p>To model creative destruction, AH propose the following approach.</p><p>Suppose the final good – for example, a car – is produced using a worker and a machine (a factory robot). The machine, on the other hand, is produced by a single firm that owns the intellectual property (IP) behind it. This “IP </p>...</source>
