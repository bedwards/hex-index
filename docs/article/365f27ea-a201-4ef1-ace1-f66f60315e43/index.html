        <p><strong>Four unusual patterns shape the month ahead</strong></p><p>I remember that I used to be happy to find one or two major aspects between outer planets that I could write about in this monthly forecast section. That was already considered big astrological news! Now it seems like the skies are as addicted to superlatives as Donald Trump: Each month seems ‘historical’ in that it has even more rare configurations on offer than the last one. October has got four of them in this order: another Kite spanning the Aries Point, a T-square, a Grand Water Trine and a Cradle.</p><p>Astrology students will be excited to see that these rare patterns actually do exist, but the sheer number of them in such a short time is a mind-boggler even for experienced astrologers. What makes them interesting in terms of their political significance is that they all clearly interact with the national charts of the US and Israel and the birth charts of their political leaders Trump and Netanyahu, amongst others. Although these configurations blend into one another, let’s take a look at each one separately to get a feel for how they could color the month of October before we take a brief look at the individual weeks.</p><p><strong>Venus in Libra: The Cosmos plays its ace</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg" width="356" height="349.4924731182796" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:913,&quot;width&quot;:930,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:356,&quot;bytes&quot;:89433,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://cosmiccompanion.substack.com/i/175560522?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yQfy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96abe02e-6622-4d2d-bca0-2262c95aa35e_930x913.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><em>The Kite pattern on October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2025 (several faster celestial bodies like the Moon are not shown to make the pattern stand out more clearly).</em></p><p>We have already seen three Kites forming in the last two months, each with a planet entering the sign of Libra: first Mars at the beginning of August, then Mercury and the Sun at the end of September. Each time, steps were taken by the US government to get closer to peace talks, whether this was regarding the war against the Ukraine or Gaza. The first attempt at peacemaking, Trump’s meet-up with Putin, didn’t gain much traction. Traditional astrologers would argue that this was due to Mars being on “foreign territory” in Libra, which prevented Mars from acting as designed. The recent two steps towards a ceasefire in Gaza seem to be more promising, although things are far from being cut and dry while I’m writing this. Fortunately, the cosmos has another ace up its sleeve: Venus will be the last planet to enter Libra, forming the last kite of this sequence on October 14<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Even though </p>...</source>
