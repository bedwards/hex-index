        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis revolves around &#039;crowding in&#039; private investment through deficit reduction - the opposite of crowding out. Understanding this economic concept and the debate around government borrowing&#039;s effect on private investment is essential to grasping the article&#039;s argument about why OBRA 93 worked.</p>

        <h6>Time to fly my left-neoliberal freak flag! For a failure to get the history right may well lead us to inaccurate conclusions about what our government-debt outlook really is, &amp; mistake how resulting economic &amp; political-economic problems should be dealt with:</h6><div><hr></div><p>Credible fiscal anchors crowd in private investment when the central bank leans against demand shortfalls and technology makes capital cheaper. Clinton’s OBRA 93 deficit-reduction Reconciliation package accelerated the economy, because macro reality beats tribal signaling. Fiscal credibility, pro-work redistribution, and a supportive Fed plus falling ICT prices crowded in investment, the 1994 yield-curve shift move reflected growth strength and MBS mechanics, not fears of “austerity gone wrong.” The Clinton 1990s really were a fabulous decade that delivered rising employment, low inflation, and real wage gains, with the EITC expansion the single biggest pro–working-poor social-insurance expansion. Labeling this “austerity” misses how structure + demand + technology produced more capital, higher productivity, and a richer America. </p><p>And taking claims that Clinton’s OBRA 93 would tank the economy as real fears by credible macroeconomic analysts is to mistake political bullshit for real analytical judgements and warranted fears.</p><div><hr></div><p>I write because I think the very sharp Marcus Nunes gets this one wrong here. </p><p>He is reviewing the the fiscal adjustment that was the Clinton 1993 Reconciliation deficit-reduction bill—OBRA 93 &lt;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1993</a>&gt;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png" width="1456" height="537" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:537,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:124417,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://braddelong.substack.com/i/183155028?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!25X8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c2c3a11-8f90-4964-b9d1-9ef75ecfea2b_1956x722.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It crowded-in a truly extraordinary boost to investment in America, which was further amplified by the secular fall in the relative price of information-communications capital goods that was the internet boom. And American economic growth was, thereafter, stronger by perhaps 0.5%-points per year. Figure that America today is 15% richer because of Bill Clinton and those of us who worked for and supported him.</p><p>OBRA 93 was viewed by us left-neoliberals—us Rubin Democrats—who pushed this in 1993 as very much a second installment of what had been OBRA 90: the George H.W. Bush-Mitchell-Foley deficit-reduction package of three years before. OBRA 93 did have more tax increases and fewer spending cuts in the mix, but by a narrow margin. OBRA 93 was more progressive than OBRA 90, but again by a narrow margin. But both combined revenue increases with spending restraint rather than relying on one side of the ledger alone, both raised top‑bracket income tax liabilities and closed loopholes/preferences to broaden the base and increase progressivity, both tightened discretionary spending caps and enforced them with sequestration/PayGo‑style budget rules to deter backsliding, </p>...</source>
