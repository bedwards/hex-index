        <p>Last month, I asked all the readers here at <em>Strength In Numbers</em> to <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/what-do-you-want-to-ask-in-our-2026">propose a question</a> to add to our monthly surveys in 2026. Over 200 people pitched in, mostly with good and usable questions. Thanks to everyone who participated!</p><p>We (Elliott + Verasight, my survey partner!) just went into the field with our January poll, and part of the process for that survey was compiling all the questions y’all sent in so we could pick a few to run. For transparency (and fun!), I figured I’d share the complete list of your questions below. I have done a very rough edit of the question text and response options for clarity. Not all of these questions will be used this year, and most are not in the final form we would use in a poll; I’m just sharing them for fun.</p><p>Happy reading. If these spark any additional questions or comments, drop ‘em below!</p><div><hr></div><h2>Energy &amp; Infrastructure</h2><p><strong>If a candidate proposed to require large technology companies to pay for energy grid upgrades needed to power their data centers, would that make you more or less likely to vote for them?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Much more likely</p></li><li><p>Somewhat more likely</p></li><li><p>No difference</p></li><li><p>Somewhat less likely</p></li><li><p>Much less likely</p></li></ul><p><strong>Who do you think should primarily pay for the additional infrastructure required to power large data centers?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The technology companies building and operating the data centers</p></li><li><p>Electric utility companies</p></li><li><p>Federal government (taxpayers)</p></li><li><p>State and local governments</p></li><li><p>Shared among all of the above</p></li><li><p>Not sure</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Party &amp; Voting Behavior</h2><p><strong>Which party do you think cares more about people like you?</strong></p><ul><li><p>The Democratic Party</p></li><li><p>The Republican Party</p></li><li><p>Both about equally</p></li><li><p>Neither party</p></li><li><p>Not sure</p></li></ul><p><strong>Do you think there is a need for a new major political party in the United States?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Yes, definitely</p></li><li><p>Yes, probably</p></li><li><p>No, probably not</p></li><li><p>No, definitely not</p></li><li><p>Not sure</p></li></ul><p><strong>Which statement best describes your view?</strong><br><em>I would be more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate if they...</em></p><ul><li><p>Represented the moderate or centrist wing of the party more</p></li><li><p>Represented the progressive wing of the party more</p></li><li><p>Neither - I would not be more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate regardless</p></li><li><p>Not sure</p></li></ul><p><strong>Do the actions of the [Democratic Party / Republican Party] make you:</strong> [SPLIT SAMPLE - ask about one party per respondent]</p><ul><li><p>More likely to vote for them</p></li><li><p>Less likely to vote for them</p></li><li><p>Neither more nor less likely to vote for </p></li>...</ul>
