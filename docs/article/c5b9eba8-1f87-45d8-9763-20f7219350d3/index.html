        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how &#039;Molon Labe&#039; from this battle appeared on flags at the January 6th Capitol riot, and how Spartan imagery is central to white nationalist appropriation of classical history. Understanding the actual historical battle provides crucial context for how it&#039;s been mythologized.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Renaud Camus&#039;s Great Replacement theory, its connection to classical texts, and how it spread from French intellectual circles to Tucker Carlson&#039;s audience. This conspiracy theory was identified as the top predictor of January 6th participation.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article names Plutarch as one of the ancient writers who promoted the &#039;fantasy version of Sparta&#039; that white nationalists now draw upon. Understanding who Plutarch was and his enormous influence on Western education explains how these classical narratives became embedded in culture.</p>

        <p>Why do so many men “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/09/21/tiktoks-roman-empire-meme-explained/">think about the Roman Empire</a>”? And why does that meme matter more than we realize?</p><p>In this live conversation, I sat down with Professor Curtis Dozier, a classicist at Vassar College and author of the forthcoming book <em><a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300272734/the-white-pedestal/">The White Pedestal: How White Nationalists Use Ancient Greece and Rome to Justify Hate</a></em> (Yale University Press, January 6, 2026). What started as Professor Dozier’s attempt to debunk historical distortions by extremists became a much more uncomfortable discovery: <strong>there is plenty of material within ancient texts that genuinely supports white nationalist talking points.</strong> </p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p><em>I’m fighting to document these racist strategies before they’re normalized as just another mode of white supremacist indoctrination.</em></p><p><em>With no corporate backing or wealthy sponsors, this work depends entirely on readers like you.</em></p><p><em>If everyone reading this became a paid subscriber, I could investigate these warning signs full-time, but <strong>right now less than 4% of my followers are paid subscribers.</strong></em></p><p><em>If you believe in journalism that questions military action when others wave flags, please consider a paid subscription today!</em></p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>Table of Contents</h2><h3>1.
