          <strong>Battle of Thermopylae</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how &#039;Molon Labe&#039; from this battle appeared on flags at the January 6th Capitol riot, and how Spartan imagery is central to white nationalist appropriation of classical history. Understanding the actual historical battle provides crucial context for how it&#039;s been mythologized.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively discusses Renaud Camus&#039;s Great Replacement theory, its connection to classical texts, and how it spread from French intellectual circles to Tucker Carlson&#039;s audience.

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article names Plutarch as one of the ancient writers who promoted the &#039;fantasy version of Sparta&#039; that white nationalists now draw upon. Understanding who Plutarch was and his enormous influence on Western education explains how these classical narratives became embedded in culture.</p>
