        <p>Hi there! It’s Tivadar from The Palindrome.</p><p>Today was the first official live stream, and I’m going to be honest with you, I have enjoyed this like nothing else in a long time.</p><p>Even though I have been writing online for five years now, sometimes I feel that maybe I’m sitting on top of an ivory tower, writing endless arcane tomes.</p><p>This changed three weeks ago when I launched the first live session.</p><p>I was with you: teaching, discussing, occasionally stumbling my way through mathematics and machine learning. I have found the missing link. The ivory tower has been knocked over for good.</p><p>Here’s the bottom line. In addition to the usual content, we’ll do at least one live stream per week.</p><p>Content-wise, this is what I have in mind.</p><ol><li><p>Office hours (such as today’s one), where we interactively work on the next post of The Palindrome, answering any of your questions and discussing the topic in the meantime.</p></li><li><p>Unscripted discussions with industry leaders, educators, and other smart and interesting people. I don’t want to name-drop just yet, but such a livestream is currently being organized.</p></li><li><p>Live lectures. More focused, less improvisative lectures on technical topics. Think of it as the online version of a university lecture.</p></li><li><p>Reading club. We pick a paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167">like this one</a>) and go through it together, unpacking all the subtle technical details.</p></li></ol><p>With the addition of live streams, I also want to improve the paid tier offering of The Palindrome.</p><p>So, the upcoming live streams will be available for all subscribers, but the recordings will be available only for the paid tier. (Except for the streams where I have a guest. In those cases, I want to keep the recordings available for everyone.)</p><p>As usual, if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to DM me right here on Substack. I always love to hear your thoughts!</p><p>See you soon!</p><p>Cheers,<br>Tivadar</p>
