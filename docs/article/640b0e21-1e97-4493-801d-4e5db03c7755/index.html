This was highly unexpected as California was in the middle of a three-year drought and there was no rain in the forecast that afternoon. As far as I can tell, this was a total weather anomaly. She was the sort of person that would have seen the rain as a spiritual sign, and likely as a good omen. And we celebrated it as such. It was a difficult funeral because she died too young. Something didn’t feel right about the whole thing, not necessarily because of the specific dynamics and events that led to her death but because I began to see her death as part of a far wider social breakdown. Once you experience half a dozen people that die too young, too unexpectedly and too untimely, the social dimension of their deaths start to come into focus.  </p><p>The thing about social deterioration is that it is not understood as a <em>social </em>phenomenon to those most acutely affected by it. Nowhere is this more evident than in the deaths of despair. I’ve come to see these deaths of despair, or deaths from alcohol and drug overdoses and suicide up close. I want to get a few things off my chest about them. Those who are dying from these deaths of despair tend to lead lives that have a hidden dimension of struggle and toil. It is as if the social existence of their subjectivity has become invisible to others. We seem to have lost the basic common sense to link these deaths to something that is locatable in a common social cause. We don’t die <em>social </em>deaths anymore. </p><p>The deaths of despair are a class and economic phenomenon primarily but they are not reducible to that precisely because the immensity of these deaths produce a deeper spiritual, moral and cultural crisis. From 2015 - 2025 it is estimated that over 1.5 million people have died in America from drug and alcohol overdoses and suicide. Social scientists will tend to posit ‘multi-causal’ factors for what drives these deaths of despair, and they eschew ‘poverty’ as the primary cause. However, empirical studies have shown that income inequality and lower rates of social mobility are directly associated with higher death rates from suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol-related liver disease among workers.
