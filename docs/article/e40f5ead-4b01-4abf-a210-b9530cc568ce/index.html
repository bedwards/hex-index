I’ve been visiting Mexico for 20 years, and more often for the last 10 years since I married a Mexican. I’ve mainly driven around Yucatan and Quintana Roo and visited Mexico City and Queretaro, plus other tidbits. That’s a pretty narrow aperture given how big and diverse Mexico is. So the below observations are limited accordingly.</p><ol><li><p>Mexico is culturally, economically, and ethnically hierarchical. This has deep cultural roots going back to both native and Spanish social structures.</p></li><li><p>You would expect low socio-economic mobility given the high stratification. And there is — class is super sticky. But new-ish immigrant groups have done very well over the last century, such as the Lebanese and Jewish communities. (I am a Maronite appreciator.) What does that say about the opportunity available in such a society?</p></li><li><p>To answer my own question, perhaps Mexico rewards tight in-group capital (family, trust, ethnic networks) more than abstract merit. Diaspora ethnic groups succeeded because they arrived with merchant traditions, internal credit, intra-marriage, and distance from indigenous caste logic.</p></li><li><p>(Bit tangential but ‘distance from indigenous caste logic’ is underrated in other ways. You can ‘arb’ status cross-culturally, ie. find a mate that would be out of your league in your own country offshore, because your status is illegible to him/her in theirs. For example, I know a few upper class Mexicans that married Joe Blow Aussies, but would have never dreamed of doing that in Mexico. I have also seen the other way — a strapping Aussie lad finds a Mexican or Asian girl that would be of middling social status in her home country, but is fine for Australia where such things are illegible. It’s a bit funny in the case of (white) upper-class Mexicans, who implicitly misread all Aussies as ‘upper class’ based on ethnicity. This applies to many cross-cultural matches.) </p></li><li><p>It’s very difficult to make good money as an employee. Equity is ~the only path to wealth. The opportunity to build businesses is real. A Spanish woman who started a business in Mexico </p></li>...</ol>
