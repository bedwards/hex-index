        <p><strong>Once upon a time in the Ukraine</strong></p><p>Imagine the following scene: It’s prom night sometime at the end of the 1990-ies and a short but slender young man is led from the dance floor by his dance partner. They both slump into the plush sofa nearby.</p><p>“So, what do you wanna do after school?” the young woman asks, mustering his good looks.</p><p>“Become the greatest comedian on planet Earth, of course”, the young man with the boyish charm replies jokingly, putting on a fake air of importance and a flirtatious smile, which quickly vanishes when his thoughts turn to reality. “Well, my parents want me to go to law school.”</p><p>“They want you to study something so boring? You’re the greatest dancer I’ve ever met!”</p><p>“I guess they want me to do something decent in life, like all parents. My dad is a computer scientist and my mother an engineer, you know.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. But if you want to be successful, you’ve got to follow your heart.

People will adore you! And I’ll be your greatest fan tonight …!”</p><p>We do not know whether a conversation like this has ever happened in Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s life or in one of the many romcoms that he played in as an actor. What we do know, though, is that Zelenskyy has indeed the agility of a phenomenal dancer,´and that he did become a well-known comedian and entertainer in Eastern Europe in the post-Soviet countries (and, yes, he did go to law school, too). Here in the West, we know about his past in the entertainment industry because he starred as the president of the Ukraine in the TV-comedy “Servant of the people” just before he started his career in politics and ran for president in real life.</p><p>The astrological details mentioned above are also correct: Zelenskyy has an Aquarius Sun and a Gemini ascendant, suggesting that he’s got quite some sense of humor, which is ...</p>
