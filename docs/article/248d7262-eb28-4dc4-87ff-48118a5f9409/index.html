        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references a &#039;Nixon–Reagan sequence&#039; as a historical parallel to Trump&#039;s strategic retrenchment. Understanding the Nixon Doctrine—where the US shifted burden-sharing to allies while maintaining strategic commitments—provides essential context for interpreting Chinese analysts&#039; views on whether current US policy represents genuine withdrawal or strategic repositioning.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Chinese commentators reference &#039;Yalta 2.0&#039; as a framework for understanding potential great-power sphere-of-influence arrangements. The original 1945 conference where Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin divided post-war Europe provides crucial historical context for understanding how analysts conceptualize potential US-China territorial accommodations.</p>
