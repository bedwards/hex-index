        <p><em>Issue #206</em></p><p>Every season there are at least <em>some</em> individual and franchise records that are tied or broken. 2024 was no different, with new hallmarks driven in part from current trends in the game, and others from some truly standout individual achievements.</p><p><a href="https://nowtakingthefield.substack.com/p/individual-and-team-level-franchise">As I did for the 2023 season</a>, this article is my round-up of most of these new franchise records from 2024. In 2023 there were 10 teams that didn’t have any new records set for the statistics I considered. This year, there were 8 such teams:</p><ul><li><p>Philadelphia Phillies - Kyle Schwarber’s 197 strikeouts is fifth all-time, behind his 2022 and 2023 seasons and Ryan Howard in 2007 and 2008.</p></li><li><p>Miami Marlins</p></li><li><p>New York Mets - Pete Alonso came close, as his 172 strikeouts trail only 183 from 2019.</p></li><li><p>Washington Nationals</p></li><li><p>New York Yankees - Aaron Judge’s AL MVP season in 2024 appears in many of the Yankees all-time top-ten lists… but didn’t set any records for the stats I considered.</p></li><li><p>Baltimore Orioles</p></li><li><p>Minnesota Twins</p></li><li><p>Houston Astros</p></li></ul><p>What follows is a division-by-division look at the other teams, starting with National League.</p><h4>Braves</h4><p>In 2023 the Braves had several new franchise records set, such as Matt Olson’s 54 HR and 139 RBI, and Spencer Strider’s modern-era 281 strikeout record. In 2024, not so much:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fewest errors in a full season.</strong> Leaving aside the shortened 2020 campaign, the Braves this year set a new franchise record with only 68 errors—yes, even fewer than other shortened seasons like 1981, 1994, and 1995, and fewer than years before the schedule expanded to 162 games. As a result, they also tied their franchise record for highest overall fielding percentage at .988 (also achieved in 2021.)</p></li></ul><h4>Brewers</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Stolen base percentage. </strong>Although he only played in 73 games, Christian Yelich swiped 21 bases in 2024—and was caught only once. That equates to a 95.46% success rate, higher than his 93.75% in 2019 (though that year he had 30 SB with only 2 CS in 130 games played.) For his career Yelich has 205 SB vs. only 36 CS, which is a 85.06% success rate—good for 14th all-time, and 3rd all-time for players with 200 or more attempts (behind only Carlos Beltrán and Trea Turner.)</p></li></ul><h4>Reds</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Strikeouts by a batter.</strong> Elly De La Cruz is an exciting player, but in 2024 he did set the all-time Reds franchise record with 218 strikeouts. That far exceeded Drew </p></li>...</ul>
