        <p>Hello and welcome to London Centric. Thanks to all the readers who entered our competition to <a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/i/177443108/its-reader-competition-time">win the TROWEL OF TRUTH</a> off the back of this week’s story about <a href="https://www.londoncentric.media/p/london-phone-thieves-bury-devices-in-flowerbeds-phoenix-garden">phone thieves burying stolen devices</a> in flowerbeds. </p><p>Readers have also flooded our inbox with the locations of other phone stashes across the capital. Given we’re able to rapidly assemble a crowdsourced map of device drop points, you don’t have to be one of those online influencers who make a living out of talking down London to think that it would be helpful if the police were doing something similar.</p><p><strong>Today we’ve got a story about why the service charge on your restaurant bill might be replaced with an ‘admin charge’ — scroll down to read it.</strong></p><div><hr></div><p><em>London Centric’s journalism is supported by paying readers. Thank you so much to everyone who makes it possible!</em> </p><div><hr></div><h1>The “admin charge” coming to London restaurants that circumvents the new law on tipping</h1><p><strong>By Polly Smythe</strong><br><br>If you go for a meal at L’Antica Pizzeria, an Italian restaurant with branches in Hampstead and High Barnet, you might find a 12.5% “admin charge” added to your bill. It looks a lot like a service charge and it is the same percentage cut as many service charges. But there’s one key difference — the different name means it doesn’t have to go to staff.</p><p>When one London Centric reader dined there recently, the fee took their meal from £69.20 to £77.85. When the diner asked the waiter what it was for, they were told it was to “cover the cost of the card machine and general restaurant costs.” </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg" width="431" height="818.0308422301305" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1600,&quot;width&quot;:843,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:431,&quot;bytes&quot;:141333,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.londoncentric.media/i/177651330?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XbLU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b0bf123-54be-45e6-b8aa-764920a1f1e1_843x1600.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is just one of the more brazen attempts to sidestep a new law requiring restaurants to pass tips to their staff in full, as restaurant owners try to remain financially viable in the face of rapidly-increasing costs. When London Centric paid a visit to L’Antica, the restaurant manager told us she wasn’t authorised to talk to us about the admin charge. Our follow-up emails went unanswered.</p><p>“No matter what senior management call it, customers will assume that this charge is a tip that should go to workers but it won’t,” said Bryan Simpson, who leads on hospitality for the Unite union. “That is completely disingenuous and almost certainly a breach of the Fair Tips Act, at least in spirit if not the letter of the law.”</p><p>Whether it’s “admin </p>...</source>
