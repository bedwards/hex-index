And what does civilian oversight of APD actually mean? </p><p>Let's look at a recent deadly incident that somehow has not garnered any coverage in local media or attention from activists. </p><p>According to an <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Office%20of%20Police%20Oversight/Disciplinary%20Recommendations/OPO-Discipline-Recommendation---Ofc.-Zucchi---Case-2025-0204.pdf?ref=austinpolitics.net" rel="noreferrer">Aug. 15 letter</a> to APD Chief Lisa Davis from Police Oversight Director Gail McCant, in March of this year Officer Avery Zucchi was driving 51 mph over the speed limit while responding to a call about a "disturbance involving a subject armed with a gun."

Exceed the speed limit but must regulate their speed so as not to endanger life or property," and GO 804.2, which states, "vehicles will be operated in such a manner and at a rate of speed that the driver, by use of ordinary care, can avoid colliding with another vehicle, object, or person."</blockquote><p>She further recommended APD revise department policies to specify maximum speeds for responding to high priority calls. </p><p>McCant concluded her report by requesting that Chief Lisa Davis provide a "detailed, public ...</p>
