Both alike in dignity. </p><p>In fair Europe, where we set our scene. </p><p>From ancient roots break to new silicon. </p><p>In 1987, Italy's SGS Microelettronica and France's Thomson Semiconducteurs decided to join forces. It was a historic alliance that created a European semiconductor giant - a globally competitive one at that. </p><p>The stories of these two star-cross'd silicon lovers are fascinating. In today's video, we talk about the merger that created SGS-Thomson, now STMicroelectronics.  </p><p>Oh, and I do want to sincerely apologize for totally mangling these European pronunciations. Feel free to make fun of me in the comments. </p><h2>An Urgent Need </h2><p>Let us start in Italy. Because the history of SGS is far simpler. And also because I like pasta. </p><p>SGS begins with the iconic Italian industrialist Adriano Olivetti. Adriano was the son of the founder of an iconic Italian typewriter company. A visionary leader with immense drive and energy, he pushed his company into the computer space in the mid-1950s. </p><p>Their first prototype - the Elea 9001 - had been built with vacuum tubes. It worked fine, but Adriano and the brilliant Chinese-Italian leading his computer team Dr. Mario Tchou decided to redesign and rebuild the computer using solid-state transistors. </p><div id="youtube2-vfMxcrN90PE" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;vfMxcrN90PE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vfMxcrN90PE?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>The resulting success convinced Olivetti and Tchou that transistors were the future. But Adriano did not want to import these critical items from the United States - where they were first invented - or West Germany or the Netherlands. They wanted to make them here in Italy. </p><p>However, the Olivetti Company had its hands full with the work of producing computers. Fundamentally, they saw themselves as a mechanical company ill-equipped to handle the challenges of solid-state device mass-manufacture. </p><p>While debating the merits of starting a full research laboratory themselves, the two hear about another Italian company working on transistors. </p><h2>Starting SGS </h2><p>Born in 1906, Virgilio Floriani grew up believing in the value of technology and innovation. </p><p>During the war, he worked as a designer and engineer for a military radio factory. After the war ended, he founded the Italian telecommunications company Telettra in 1946. The name is an amalgamation of "Telephony, Electronics, Radio". </p><p>Telettra introduced a series of new technologies to post-war Italy. So when Floriani realized that nobody else in the European telephone industry thought these transistor things were important, he saw a chance to seize the high ground. </p><p>So Telettra bought a license from Bell, ...</p>
