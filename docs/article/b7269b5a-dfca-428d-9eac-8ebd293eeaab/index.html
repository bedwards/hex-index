Yet, even 80 years after the guns fell silent, new chapters of that vast conflict continue to emerge, reminding us that the war was fought not just on the beaches of Normandy or the islands of the Pacific, but in the shadows.</p><p>Bruce Henderson’s captivating new book,<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Midnight-Flyboys/Bruce-Henderson/9781668051412"> </a><em><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Midnight-Flyboys/Bruce-Henderson/9781668051412">Midnight Flyboys</a></em>, takes us back to those days of danger and glory, illuminating a specific, harrowing campaign that has long remained a footnote in the broader history of the air war. It centers on the operations of the code-named “carpetbaggers”—U.S. Army Air Force pilots who flew modified B-24 bombers on low-altitude, nighttime missions to drop supplies and allied agents behind enemy lines. Central to this story are not just the aviators, but the intrepid spies—many of them women, by the way—who volunteered to hitch rides on these treetop missions, parachuting into the peril of Nazi-occupied Europe.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Henderson is no stranger to these themes; he<a href="https://brucehendersonbooks.com/"> has written frequently</a>, and always engagingly, about the human element in war. His previous book,<a href="https://brucehendersonbooks.com/books/sons-and-soldiers/"> </a><em><a href="https://brucehendersonbooks.com/books/sons-and-soldiers/">Sons and Soldiers</a></em>, chronicled the German-Jewish emigres who escaped Europe only to return as U.S. soldiers. The “Ritchie Boys,” as they were called, after the name of the Maryland camp where they trained,  interrogated German POWs and provided key intelligence that aided the allied victory. In <em>Midnight Flyboys</em>, Henderson turns his gaze from the interrogation rooms to the cockpits and the drop zones, focusing on a moment when the air war over Europe shifted into high gear.</p><p>It is inspiring, and sobering, to read these accounts of such selfless warriors today. Most of the fighters were barely old enough to vote. My father was a 22-year-old Navy officer when he was assigned to a ship in the South Pacific. My friend, the late Col. Robert Z. Grimes was just 21 when he began piloting B-17 bombers over Nazi territory.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut, himself a veteran and POW in a Nazi prison camp, captured this reality perfectly in<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/184345/slaughterhouse-five-by-kurt-vonnegut/"> </a><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/184345/slaughterhouse-five-by-kurt-vonnegut/">Slaughterhouse-Five</a></em>, which he struggled to write for 20-plus years after the war ended.
