        <p>When I was younger, I loved science-fiction short stories. And my biggest dream for myself was to be a successful story writer—someone like Robert Reed or Michael Swanwick, who appeared regularly in the sci-fi journals and was a routine contender for the Hugo and Nebula Awards.</p><p>During this time of my life, from ages 17 to about 22, I read every major sci-fi writer and most of the minor ones. At some point I bought a lot of fifty sci-fi anthologies from eBay, and I’d spend my afternoons and evenings reading through<em> Full Spectrum</em> or <em>The World of If</em>. Later when I had access to a university library, I read all of the twenty plus volumes of the Gardner Dozois <em>Year’s Best Science Fiction </em>anthology, and many volumes of the Hartwell / Cramer Year’s Best as well. One of my bucket-list items was to eventually be reprinted in that Dozois Year’s Best—I loved it so much, and when Dozois died I was sad the dream would never come true.</p><p>I sometimes subscribed to sci-fi journals, but didn’t read them religiously. However, I followed the blogs and forums fairly closely, and if a story writer started getting a lot of buzz, I’d read their stuff. If I enjoyed an author’s stories, I also tried to track down whatever collections they’d released.</p><p>Then when I was about 23, I started thinking, “What about everything else?” That’s when I started reading the classics, and stopped paying such close attention to science fiction.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png" width="1456" height="150" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:150,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:37150,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.woman-of-letters.com/i/180457623?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tCes!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87a2c4cc-b703-4c99-82fe-627e4bf8808c_1456x150.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><h4>Literary fiction didn’t interest me as much</h4><p>A few years later, I entered an MFA program, and I drifted more into the literary fiction world.</p><p>But I never really paid as much attention to American literary fiction as I’d paid to science fiction.
