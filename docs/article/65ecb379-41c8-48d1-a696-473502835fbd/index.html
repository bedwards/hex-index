        <p>In ‘<a href="https://www.thesubtext.io/the-chicken-or-the-exit">The Chicken or The Exit</a>’ co-authored with Osarumen Osamuyi, I wrote this:</p><blockquote><p>However, even the most optimistic estimates would put Africa firmly in the experimentation stage or the beginnings of the scaling stage. The continent only just had its&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/11/nigerias-interswitch-confirms-1b-valuation-after-visa-investment/">first unicorn</a>. China had its first unicorn in 2010, and it took five years for it to get to five unicorns; the year after that, it had twenty. Ecosystems develop very slowly, and then all at once.  </p></blockquote><p>When I wrote this earlier in the year, Africa had one unicorn - Interswitch<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. Today, we have 3 unicorns, with <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ci/blog/flutterwave-series-c">Flutterwave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/african-fintech-opay-reportedly-raising-400m-at-a-1-5b-valuation/">Opay</a> joining the stables<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>.</p><p>I was recently a guest on the Africa Tech Round Up podcast’s <a href="https://www.africantechroundup.com/unajua-1-derin-adebayo/">Unajua series</a> where I tried to answer the question <a href="https://www.africantechroundup.com/unajua-1-derin-adebayo/">‘Is the African technology ecosystem at an inflection point?’</a> (spoiler alert: it is). </p><p>In the first episode, embedded below, I talk about how looking at the number of unicorns always undersold the opportunity for digital financial services in Africa. There are four billion-dollar financial services businesses in Africa hidden inside telcos. MTN MoMo, Airtel Money, Mpesa, and Orange Money all generate between $1B-$400M in yearly revenues. Even the most conservative multiple would value all of them at more than $1B.</p><div class="soundcloud-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1055179807&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UNAJUA S1 EP1: How significant is the opportunity for tech companies in Africa? feat. Derin Adebayo by African Tech Roundup&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Welcome to the first episode of African Tech Roundup's new learning podcast series called Unajua. The word 'unajua' is a word in KiSwahili that means \&quot;do you know?\&quot;\n\nHere's how the Unajua Series will work... First, we'll crowdsource pertinent questions from you, The Village, and break them down into 3 to 6 bite-sized sub-questions. Then, we'll invite a revolving door of Villagers who know a little more than a thing or two about how things work in our ecosystem to offer what we're calling 'minimum actionable responses' to these sub-questions—in 15 minutes or less. From here on in, Unajua Episodes will drop every Monday.\n\nTo launch the series, we've sourced answers to the question: Is the African technology ecosystem at an inflection point?\n\nFactoring in on this question in a three-part response is Nigerian analyst and researcher Derin Adebayo. Derin covers technology, entrepreneurship, and venture capital across emerging markets in his monthly Substack newsletter called Unevenly Distributed.\n\nHe formerly worked at the hotel booking platform Hotels.ng and the VC firm, Ingressive Capital. He now works for Endeavor— the global community of 2,000 odd high-impact entrepreneurs spread across something like 40 emerging and underserved markets.\n\nIn this episode, Derin tackles the central theme question by answering two sub-questions for the price of one. First, \&quot;How large is the opportunity for a tech company in Africa?\&quot; Then, \&quot;Should we be worried about a lack of exits?\&quot;\n\nImage credit: Nupo Deyon Daniel&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-1qrrzRCRkezVxjB5-Q46NYQ-t500x500.jpg&quot;,&quot;author_name&quot;:&quot;African Tech Roundup&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://soundcloud.com/african-tech-round-up&quot;,&quot;targetUrl&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-component-name="SoundcloudToDOM"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?auto_play=false&amp;buying=false&amp;liking=false&amp;download=false&amp;sharing=false&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_playcount=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;hide_related=true&amp;visual=false&amp;start_track=0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F1055179807" frameborder="0" gesture="media" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>The mobile money revolution that has taken over the continent has largely skipped Nigeria.

Bank penetration is not as high as in South Africa or Namibia. While mobile money penetration is not as high as in places like Kenya or Tanzania. This leaves Nigeria stuck in the middle of nowhere, with ~50% of the country excluded from formal financial services.</p><p>This is starting to change. The CBN <a href="https://businessday.ng/banking-finance/article/cbn-issues-licence-to-glo-9mobile-up-subsidiaries-for-psb-services/">finally granted telcos the license</a> to independently operate in financial services about a year ago. Banks are increasingly investing in their agency networks. Pure play agency banking players are also experiencing rapid growth.
