        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to m</em>e.</p><h3>30% cheaper than nationals</h3><p>OnTrac will launch two national services in early 2026: OnTrac Express (2–3 days coast-to-coast via ClearJet air) and Ground Essentials (1–2 days slower than standard ground, up to 30% cheaper than national services, with no residential surcharge). Early access is available, and pilots are underway. It’s also debuting “7-Day Play” with Fenix Commerce to show precise delivery dates at checkout, and reports domestic shipper volume up 40% YoY. These services will provide a stronger alternative to FedEx/UPS — especially for non-urgent DTC parcels — pressuring rates while improving landed costs and checkout conversion.

And it’s only July. But, it turns out, our eyes are not deceiving us — retailers may be moving up the peak shopping season. Or, maybe creating a new one. A report by Vertex suggests that we may now be able to consider summer a peak shopping season that rivals (or will soon) the traditional November-December peak season. The survey found that 76% of consumers buy summer clothing and accessories, 71% pick up hobby items, 65% stock up on sunscreen, 41% purchase beach gear, and 34% grab water toys during the summer months. And now we have Amazon Prime Days and special sales from the likes of Walmart and Target as well to rival Amazon. The result is that more shopping is taking place in the summer months, and demand planners may need to rethink their sourcing strategies to accommodate this growing shift.

The European Parliament will adopt a new law requiring textile makers to manage waste from clothing to blankets to curtains. The European Parliament is looking to reduce the environmental impact of the fast-fashion industry. Some 12.6 million metric tons of textile waste are generated in the EU each year, according to the European Commission. ...</p>
