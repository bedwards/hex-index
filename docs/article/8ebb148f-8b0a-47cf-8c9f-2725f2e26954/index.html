The word “unprecedented” begins to feel redundant.</p><p>It can feel similarly redundant to reiterate how off track progress on climate remains, or how steep a hill we have left to climb.</p><p>Breaking out of this grim redundancy means celebrating the wins we get and, most importantly, understanding them—how they happened, which strategies can be leveraged in other areas, and how we can build momentum off the back of them toward the future we want to see.</p><p>That’s why in this week’s newsletter, we are highlighting the landmark Advisory Opinion on climate by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) from 23rd July.</p><p>Specifically, we are honoured to have had the opportunity to interview Harj Narulla, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers specialising in climate law and litigation. He’s been in the news recently as the counsel for Solomon Islands, a small Pacific island nation, in this case—the outcome of which could fundamentally shape climate action in the years to come.</p><p>As Narulla says: “The stakes have changed fundamentally. The developing world now has essentially a credible alternative where they can say: if you don't provide us with what we want, we can go to the ICJ to pursue a legal remedy.”</p><p>The interview is wide-ranging, but one of the most interesting parts is the story of how this case began: with a group of law students at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji. As Narulla says, “one of the most remarkable and inspiring aspects of this process [has been] the leadership from those Pacific students.” If you want to read more about how it came to the ICJ, then I’d recommend this piece on the students published on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/future/article/20250721-how-a-bold-student-plan-swept-to-un-world-court">BBC website</a>. It’s a fascinating story.</p><p>I’ll leave the rest to Narulla.</p><p>Now, if you think this will all be interviews, you’d be very wrong. Our next newsletter will </p>...</source>
