        <p>Dear readers,</p><p>First, I want to express my<strong> deep thanks to everyone who reads and supports </strong><em><strong>Strength In Numbers</strong></em>. This week, several <a href="https://x.com/jbarro/status/1988762670938349945?s=42">high-profile analysts</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gelliottmorris.com/post/3m5nf2z6bws27">partisan pollsters</a> engaged in extensive ad hominem attacks against me and even <a href="https://x.com/lxeagle17/status/1989042134780112957?s=20">questioned my motivation</a> for publishing this newsletter. This is all because I am <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/data-over-dogma-a-reply-to-matt-yglesias?utm_source=publication-search">coming to data-driven conclusions</a> that <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/the-new-york-times-makes-several">expose errors in their theories</a> of <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/the-strategists-fallacy">how politics works</a>, or that otherwise <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trumps-winning-2024-coalition-has">conflict with their own narratives</a> about politics and elections today.</p><p>Critics can say whatever they want. I say: Let’s stick to an <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/articles/do-moderates-win-more-elections">empirical discussion</a> of the data and the merits of various methods (ours are <a href="https://github.com/markjrieke/2026-war">open-source</a>, nobody else’s are) we can use to understand numbers and the world around us. I have <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/you-should-quit-social-media-for">no interest</a> in getting involved in pointless schoolyard fights on social media.</p><p>My <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/about">mission</a> with this publication is to produce independent, empirical analysis of politics and voting behavior — and I will continue to do that job regardless of who it pisses off or the hit my reputation takes among the elite-contrarian-consultant industrial complex. The loudest critics of my work are the people who have the most to lose from there being a popular, independent alternative on the market. The pushback I’m getting is proof that there is a need for high-quality empirical political analysis that is independent of the monetary and groupthink incentives that drive so much of the media’s analysis today.</p><p>So, <strong>thank you for supporting me and this publication</strong>. My work is funded by you, my readers, and accountable to the facts, not billionaire donors or Super PACs paying me for my conclusions. A diverse group of paying subscribers — devoted to the idea that rigorous analysis of data can uncover more truths about the world than punditry and partisan spin — makes factual independent journalism and analysis possible. You can continue to rely on <em>Strength In Numbers</em> for high-quality journalism regardless of what the bullies, partisans, and wealthy and well-connected say about me.</p><p>Now, for this week’s data roundup: The lead story is <strong>Trump’s rising unpopularity with swing voters, nationally and in key states</strong>. New YouGov polling shows an all-time low for the president among political independents. Should Republican Senators in purple seats be worried?</p><p>On deck here at <em>Strength In Numbers</em>: This week, I’ll share the results of our post-election survey with Verasight — including the normal poll write-up, plus ...</p>
