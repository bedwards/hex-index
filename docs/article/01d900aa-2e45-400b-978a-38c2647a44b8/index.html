        <h2>Dear Audrey,</h2><p>I’m writing this open letter to you far into the future, I don’t think you’d have envisioned being 27 - above all I don’t think you’d have envisioned writing this 6,686 miles away from home. What probably shocks you most is that you’re drinking red wine and you’re kinda enjoying it. It’s from California and I have to say, it’s going down quite well and definitely helping you with the Sunday Scaries… that’s adult talk for perpetually hating the fact that the weekend is coming to an end and work starts tomorrow. But damn girl, we’ve come so far. I can tell you that, that feeling you have of being stuck in a country so far removed from everything, where you think things matter, will disappear. You’re determined to make a life outside of that bubble and you do, in London of all places.&nbsp;</p><p>On things like love, you find it, and it’s not really what you thought it would be. Let’s face it Audz, you are an overly optimistic romantic but I cherish that because when the world is bleak you find ways to see better days. I needed that, we needed that, and you don’t understand how much that gets us through a lot of pain and days when we just want to give up. P.s. London isn’t filled with guys that look like Robbie from Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging. You’re better off giving up on those expectations and eventually you realise, love and guys kinda suck. No one’s going to write you poems or sing you love songs and that’s okay because finding someone who is present and consistent is all that matters.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg" width="472" height="752" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:752,&quot;width&quot;:472,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:47536,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OtIm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7596d7b-855b-47e4-bed9-1377515d50f1_472x752.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I think you’ll be disappointed by the fact that we, or well I, started to fear failure. Somehow, it has paralysed us from doing the things we love, it’s a killer but I’m gonna tell you that you didn’t become a writer. I mean you’re a marketer and you still technically tell stories but I suppose that’s not really the point and I’m sorry for that. No more excuses. Somehow, I’d like to think that this is an ode to that fighting spirit we had. So here’s to the times we were 5 and wrote fake news articles of the 4 dingos that escaped the zoo or to our book on the rotten rabbit and the time we tried to write </p>...</source>
