      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I got interviewed by Ben Thompson of Stratechery. The interview is below. But first, a few updates to write about. </p><p>I am moving the Asianometry Newsletter to Passport and adding it to the Stratechery Plus bundle. Released video scripts and the audio feed will be accessible to Stratechery Plus subscribers (and we have a trial offer for you below). YouTube videos will remain free, as they always have been. </p><p>As you know, video transcripts were posted somewhat sporadically. Moving forward transcripts and podcasts will be first class citizens: they will be available the same day as my public YouTube videos for Stratechery Plus subscribers. </p><p>To manage your account, including adding the podcast feed to your podcast player, and to manage your email settings, go <a href="https://asianometry.passport.online/member">here</a> (link). You can use the same email that you used to subscribe to this Substack. </p><p>To be clear, this is in addition to my YouTube channel. That is the core of my work, and if you want early access you can still subscribe to my Patreon. Nothing will change in that regard, other than the fact this is officially now my full-time job.</p><p>I have also been working with Ben to make YouTube videos for his public Articles. You can see those videos here.</p><p>I am a big fan of Ben Thompson and Stratechery and have long wanted to work with him. We’ve also arranged a <a href="https://stratechery.passport.online/member/plan/4ycW4SE71Cy6ryrijywbTG?trial=ASIANOMETRY&amp;price=YSr21tFbq4KY2tGJaA2KD3">one month trial to Stratechery Plus</a> for all of you:</p><ul><li><p>You can opt in to receive Stratechery emails or add the Stratechery podcast here </p></li><li><p>You also have access to Sharp Tech, Sharp China, Dithering, and Greatest of All Talk; click any of those links to add the podcasts to your podcast player</p></li></ul><p>This one month trial is completely free, and you don’t need a credit card, but if you do decide to join the entire bundle is $15/month (including the Asianometry podcast and transcripts). You can of course cancel at any time. </p><p>This Substack and its URL will remain open, but it’ll be mostly just for directing you guys to <a href="https://asianometry.passport.online/member">the new Asianometry site</a>. Go there for the latest work. </p><p>This is a big transition and there will be some bumps along the way. Hope you guys can bear with us as we make this update, but I think it’s going to be great. And, to be clear, if you just want to watch the videos, those are ...</p>
