        <p>Warner Bros., the storied American media conglomerate, is currently up for sale, but the company has been on an intriguing mergers and acquisitions journey for years now. </p><p>After re-emerging in the mid-aughts from the fiasco of the AOL-Time Warner merger<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> and various divestments, it had a good run as a smaller conglomerate. This corporate entity paired one of Hollywood’s premier movie studios with a number of cable channels, notably including HBO (a creative powerhouse) and CNN (a major news brand). </p><p>Then in 2016, AT&amp;T (a telecommunications infrastructure company) announced that it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Time_Warner_by_AT%26T">wanted to buy them</a>. The Trump administration sued in court to block the merger, which I think was a lowkey fascinating story of recent American politics. On the one hand, a good amount of evidence indicated this was Donald Trump abusing his power to try to punish CNN for negative coverage. But on the other, you had people like <a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1998781001149923823">obsessive Obama-hater Matt Stoller</a> who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/11/13/trumps-administration-is-right-to-block-the-att-and-time-warner-merger/">hailed Trump’s actions</a> as part of a bold and bipartisan new aggressive approach to antitrust policy that would free us from the shackles of neoliberalism. </p><p><a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/10/23/13368802/att-time-warner-merger">At the time, I said</a> that the deal was a business mistake. </p><p>There’s a long tradition of American business leaders deciding it would be fun to be the CEO of a movie studio. That’s how the oil company Gulf+Western came to own Paramount at one point and why Columbia Pictures (now part of Sony) was owned by Coca-Cola. AT&amp;T’s ownership of Warner ended badly, and they spun the entertainment conglomerate out via a new purchase that created a new larger conglomerate called Warner Bros. Discovery. </p><p>This company has had some success recently as a movie studio,<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> but I would say it’s failing at its main strategic objective, which was to compete head-to-head with Netflix. </p><p>Way back in 2012, around the time Netflix started investing in original shows, Ted Sarandos, who is now the co-CEO of the company, said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/29/3930560/netflix-wants-at-least-five-new-shows-a-year-the-goal-is-to-become">“the goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.”</a> For Netflix, that meant learning to produce quality original content. For HBO’s owners, it meant they needed to leverage the HBO brand into a full-service “our app could be your life” streaming service full of content from Warner’s extensive library of films <em>plus</em> Discovery’s big pile of basic cable staples. </p><p>I watch a lot more HBO Max than Netflix and feel, on a personal level, that their ...</p>
