        <p>Hi there, sapiens. How was your weekend? We spent ours packing for an upcoming move, which mostly meant digging grumpily through long-forgotten piles of children’s toys. This resulted in only one "accidental” discarding of a book that resulted in tears, so I’d say it was a success!<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>   </p><p>Speaking of feeling guilty, for this month’s Q&amp;A we’ve got a reader question that will be familiar to many parents, about screen time guilt and setting limits. </p><p>I’ll also be sharing some of the guiding principles I use for managing tech in my own house.</p><p>Remember to submit your questions for future posts by replying directly to this email or <a href="https://substack.com/chat/534060">posting in the chat</a>!</p><div><hr></div><h6><em><strong>9 min read</strong></em></h6><p><em><strong>Everything I read about parenting and screens talks about the importance of “setting limits.” But sometimes I just need a break, or to get stuff done! I’m constantly torn between feeling like I *should* be limiting my kids’ screen time and also feeling like it’s actually impossible to do that all the time. And feeling guilty about it all! Help!</strong></em></p><p>When people find out what I do for a living, an interesting thing happens.</p><p>I’ll be making small talk with a fellow parent, <a href="https://technosapiens.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-better-conversations">cycling through topics</a>, when I happen to share that my work focuses on kids and technology. Suddenly, there’s a shift. My once confident conversation partners are now cautious, unsure, guilt-ridden.</p><p><em>I usually put on a movie for the kids in the afternoon, </em>they’ll say, followed quickly by, <em>I know that’s probably so bad.</em></p><p>Or: <em>Oh god, you do NOT want to know what’s happening at our house with screen time. I really should be limiting it more.</em></p><p>Or: <em>I let my kid watch so much Peppa Pig that they started speaking in a British accent. It’s concerning (but also adorable).</em></p><p>All to say: I can imagine there are many parents out there who feel this question was plucked from their very brains.</p><h2>Do *good parents* allow screen time?</h2><p>In recent years, there has been a shift in our cultural understanding of screen time. Screens have become simultaneously ubiquitous and vilified. Surely, <em>good </em>parents<em> </em>limit their kids’ screen time, and the<em> best </em>parents? No screen time at all.</p><p>Screens have become yet another emblem of the march toward intensive parenting. We must constantly be doing the <em>most</em> as parents—optimizing each moment of our children’s lives, maximizing opportunities for growth and development. ...</p>
