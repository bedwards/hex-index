      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Over the summer, I published my friend Robert Cherry’s essay <a href="https://glennloury.substack.com/p/locking-them-up-for-their-own-good?utm_source=publication-search">“More, not Less, Prison May Improve the Life Chances for Youthful Offenders.”</a> I thought it was an incisive and rather alarming intervention in debates about crime reduction and recidivism. Robert is a distinguished economist, a professor emeritus at Brooklyn College and an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and I’ve long known him to be sincerely committed to coming up with practical solutions to problems affecting black communities. So I take his argument very seriously. </p><p>Youth diversion programs targeting at-risk boys and young men, Robert argues, have largely failed. So have “Raise the Age” laws that keep even those youthful offenders convicted of serious crimes out of prison. Youth offending, recidivism, and long-term unemployment remain tenacious problems. Rather than reducing or eliminating prison sentences for young offenders, Robert says, we should look to prisons as effective vehicles for rehabilitation. He argues that prison often provides youthful offenders with skills and discipline they can use after release, as well as services to help them reenter society. It’s a forceful case for remedies that the author himself recommends only “reluctantly,” amid what he sees as an absence of better solutions.</p><p>Since I published the essay, I’ve been casting around for responses to this provocative take on youth offending. I finally found some takers: Vincent Schiraldi and Lael Chester, who have decades of experience between them working with young offenders. They provide a vigorous rebuttal to Cherry’s recommendations, arguing that prison produces dismal outcome for incarcerated youths. Cherry’s reply to their rebuttal is below their essay. </p><div><hr></div><p><em>The Glenn Show is almost entirely subscriber supported.
