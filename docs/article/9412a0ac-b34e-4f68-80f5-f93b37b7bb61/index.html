        <p><em>(This story first appeared in the science fiction fanzine </em>Pulsar<em> years ago; long before, in fact, anyone on </em>30 Rock<em>, said “fellow kids.” I mention this lest you think I was making some kind of reference. Also, two of my books are 99¢ this week!)</em></p><p>My name is Muknik, which means Little Mouse, and I am being paid forty bucks to kill the last twelve surviving Lutherans on earth. Muknik is not my real name; William the Bastard gave it to me. Muknik means Little Mouse in Lutheran.</p><p>I don’t know who put up the money. I do not know who would pay forty dollars for twelve dead Lutherans.</p><p>“It doesn’t work that way, Muknik,” William the Bastard will tell me. “Ten bucks a head, times twelve, divided by the five of us.

And also long ago was when I got shanghaied, through clever machinations.</p><p>“Keep your mind on your work, Little Mouse,” William the Bastard will tell me. “You’re dreaming bitter thoughts again.” He’s right. And I am important today. That is why I will get a double share. That is why the math is right, although it looked wrong. I, Little Mouse, will get a double share. I knock on the door of the movie theater. They are holed up in a movie theater, old and abandoned. They know there is danger. They are the last twelve. They are Lutherans.</p><p>“I am Little Mouse,” I say. “You absolutely must let me in.” I act serious.</p><p>“Go away, Little Mouse.” They say, “There will be no movies showing today.”</p><p>They are ...</p>
