        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions the author watching a documentary about the spice trade and working with Burlap &amp; Barrel spices. Understanding the historical spice trade provides rich context about how global food systems developed and why certain spices became valuable commodities.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article repeatedly discusses heirloom bean varieties like Mayacoba, Ayocote Pinto, and Gigante Beans. Understanding what makes a plant variety &#039;heirloom&#039; and why these varieties are preserved provides important context for the sustainable food discussion.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">As a newsletter centered on beans as sustainable food, readers would benefit from understanding the biology, history, and global significance of Phaseolus vulgaris - the species that includes most beans mentioned in the article. This provides scientific and agricultural context beyond recipes.</p>

        <p>Every time I return to this newsletter, I remember why I do it: to write honestly about the food system, share bean recipes, and connect with people who care about the food they eat and where it comes from. </p><p>But over the past year, something else has become clear: <strong>Many of you are also trying to reach people with </strong><em><strong>your</strong></em><strong> work, and you’re trying to figure out how to do it well.</strong></p><p>Some of you are long-form writers trying to translate your voice onto social media.<br>Some of you run small businesses and want more visibility.<br>Some of you have a mission, message, or story you want to share, but aren’t sure where to start.<br>And some of you are just here to learn about the food system + recipes (which, honestly, is also perfect).</p><p>While I’ve been growing my own presence on Instagram to spread the message of eating more sustainably, I’ve also been working behind the scenes as a freelance content creator, including creating content for Burlap &amp; Barrel. That work has given me a front-row seat to what makes content resonate, how to shape a message, and how to reach the right people online without burning out or watering down your message.</p><p>All of that learning has made me want to make this newsletter more useful for <em>you</em> — whether that means more stories about the food system, more bean recipes, or guidance for anyone who wants to show up online with clarity and purpose.</p><p>Before I decide what direction to grow into (including the possibility of adding a separate newsletter just for content strategy), I’d love to hear from you.</p><h2>Please vote! 🙏 </h2><div class="poll-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:412636}" data-component-name="PollToDOM"></div><div><hr></div><h2>Iluminate’s Gift Guide (not all beans) 🎁</h2><ol><li><p><a href="https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/pages/about-us">Burlap &amp; Barrel spices.</a> Yes, I work for them, but they also have incredible spices, and the variety is unmatched. Playing with flavor has become my new favorite thing. No piece of toast is without Black Urfa Chili or Silk Chili now, and every pot of beans gets Shallot Powder, Purple Striped Garlic, and Bay Leaf Powder as a base. My family was fighting over who got to take home the Pepita Pumpkin Spice over Thanksgiving! Their bundles are a great place to start for yourself, or as a gift, like the <a href="https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/products/fundamentals-collection">Fundamentals Collection</a>, <a href="https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/products/chefs-collection">the Chef’s Collection</a>, or you can <a href="https://www.burlapandbarrel.com/apps/bundles/bundle/144768">build your own</a>. <strong>They also have a Black Friday sale happening right now, </strong></p></li>...</ol>
