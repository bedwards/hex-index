Last time we did this, we talked about the <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ubers-bastards">(im)moral economy of on-demand labor platforms and their transformation of care work</a> via A Roosevelt Institute report by Katie J. Wells and Funda Ustek Spilda. Today, we’ll look at another report from Wells, Spilda, Veena Dubal and Mark Graham—this time at Fairwork US, investigating the <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/03/Fairwork-US-2025-Report_Web-2.pdf">industries corrupted by algorithmic management tools (and the firms deploying them)</a>.</p><p><em>As always, if you enjoy my writing then consider a free subscription.
