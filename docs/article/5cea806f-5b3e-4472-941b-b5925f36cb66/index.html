      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>     Dr. Ronald Nash defines a worldview as “a set of beliefs about the most important issues in life.” He also states that a worldview must have a “conceptual scheme,” whereby a truly consistent worldview has a system of beliefs that hold the worldview together so that issues can be consistently processed and prioritized accordingly. Nash uses the example of how the right prescription eyeglasses allows their wearer to be able to see things clearly, but the wrong prescription will in no way help the wearer despite the fact that both are eyeglasses. In other words, only a faithful, consistent worldview, rooted in truth and wisdom, will be able to help people see the events of the day and the issues of life in the right light that is based in reality. </p><p>     This is why the Christian Worldview is superior in every way to all other worldviews, and truly why it is the only way in which reality can be rightly understood. Yes, elements of other worldviews (worldviews can range from other religions to philosophical to simply emotional) can posses elements of truth when considering or looking at certain issues, but where they do recognize truth they are borrowing from a Christian worldview in order to see that truth, and simultaneously they are violating the consistency in their own worldview because reality cannot be ignored. For instance, when the atheist makes claims about an issue being either morally right or morally wrong, they are using a Christian worldview to make such claims, because in a consistent atheistic worldview such claims on morality cannot be made. Without a belief in God who established a moral order in keeping with His Holy character, morality simply becomes a construct of the people and whatever the people decide in the moment to be moral is what is seen as moral. Therefore, morality is always shifting and the standards of society are always in flux, because there is no standard of truth. </p><p>     To understand how all these different worldviews came about, and why so many people hate the Biblical Worldview (I will use “Christian” and “Biblical” interchangeably because the two terms should be synonymous), all one has to do is go to the beginning when Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden and took of the fruit from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and plunged themselves and their descendants ...</p>
