        <p>OpenAI recently launched <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/">ChatGPT Search</a>, where users can “get fast, timely answers with links to relevant web sources.” It works similarly to Perplexity, allowing you to enter a search query and receive a synthesized response that cites the exact sources used to generate the answer. Now, instead of having to sift through every link on Google to get the answer to your burning question, ChatGPT Search can go through these links and output the response for you in a matter of seconds. ChatGPT Search is currently only available to Plus and Team users, but will be available to the broader public in the coming months. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!saGm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp" width="652" height="366.75" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff117318-e229-4767-ba39-f151475ac51f_3840x2160.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:652,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Screenshot of backyard improvement suggestions, including cozy seating, outdoor lighting, and fire pits, with images of stylish backyard setups.
