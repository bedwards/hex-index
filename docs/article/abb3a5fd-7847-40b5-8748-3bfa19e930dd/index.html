        <p>Welcome to Issue 13 of the London Longevity Newsletter <strong>🗞️</strong></p><p><em>As we wrap up 2025, we want to express our gratitude to everyone in the community for showing up and building the Longevity ecosystem along with us here in London. There’s still a lot left to be done, but we’re proud of the momentum we’ve been able to create this year. We’ve had some incredible gatherings this year, and hope to be back with even more exciting ones in the New Year! We’re only just getting started. </em></p><p><em>Also, hope you enjoyed reading the newsletter and derived some value from it over the last few months. We’ve really enjoyed curating it for you. Some exciting new things are in the works for the newsletter as well moving forward. Thank you once again, and Happy Holidays!  </em></p><p>Christmassy-LLN Drinks TBA soon, too. Stay tuned! 🎄👀</p><p>Now let’s dive in:</p><h2><strong>RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT</strong> 🧬</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Can plasma proteins reveal how fast each organ in your body is aging?</strong><br>Using a proteomic dataset of 43,616 UK Biobank participants plus external validation in cohorts from China and the U.S., this study builds organ-specific proteomic aging clocks for ten major organs. These clocks accurately estimate biological age across populations and show that different organs age at different rates within the same person. Accelerated organ aging strongly predicts future disease, multimorbidity and mortality, often years before clinical diagnosis. Among all tissues, the brain aging clock is the most powerful, forecasting dementia risk, cognitive decline and even all-cause mortality more strongly than organismal aging or genetic risk factors like APOE4. Key proteins driving these clocks map to biologically interpretable pathways like synaptic loss, vascular dysfunction, glial activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, revealing shared mechanisms between organ aging and neurodegenerative or metabolic disease. Importantly, the team derives parsimonious protein panels that retain predictive power, opening the door for clinically deployable blood tests. Together, the work provides a high-resolution, organ-by-organ map of biological aging with implications for early risk detection, personalised prevention and precision geroscience. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-01016-8">Read More</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can targeted estrogen rejuvenate aging bones without systemic side effects?</strong><br>This study presents a bone-targeted estrogen delivery system that reverses osteoporosis in mice by restoring mitochondrial function in osteoblasts, without exposing the rest of the body to hormone levels associated with cancer or cardiovascular risk. The team engineered a coacervate core loaded with low-dose estrogen and wrapped it in a metal–phenolic network (MPN) shell, which naturally </p></li>...</ul>
