        <h4>The idea of the personal computer</h4><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovators_%28book%29">The Innovators</a>, his wide-ranging history of the development of computer technology, Walter Isaacson starts the chapter ‘The Personal Computer’ with a discussion of Vannevar Bush’s Memex:</p><blockquote><p><em>The idea of a personal computer, one that ordinary individuals could get their hands on and take home, was envisioned in 1945 by Vannevar Bush. After building his big analog computer at MIT and helping to create the military-industrial-academic triangle, he wrote an essay for the July 1945 issue of the Atlantic titled "As We May Think.” In it he conjured up the possibility of a personal machine, which he dubbed a memex, that would store and retrieve a person's words, pictures, and other information: "Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library.... A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory." The word intimate was important. Bush and his followers focused on ways to make close, personal connections between man and machine.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Atlantic article appeared a few months before ENIAC, the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, ran it’s first practical program, one designed to help understand the feasibility of creating a hydrogen bomb. Bush led the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) which co-ordinated war related scientific research, including early work on atomic weapons. But with the war almost over, his thoughts were moving to his earlier interests in computers as tools for civilian research. In the 1920s and 1930s he had helped develop a mechanical analog computer - known as a ‘differential analyser’ - to solve differential equations. It’s perhaps not surprising then that he included a reference in his Atlantic article to Charles Babbage’s attempts to create a mechanical computer a century earlier:</p><blockquote><p><em>Babbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not produce his great arithmetical machine. His idea was sound enough, but construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy. Had a Pharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and had he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources of his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single car, and that car would have broken down on </em></p>...</blockquote>
