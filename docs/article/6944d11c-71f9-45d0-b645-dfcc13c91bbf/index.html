        <p class="topic-summary">The entire article centers on the &#039;missing heritability&#039; debate - understanding the technical definition of heritability (narrow-sense vs broad-sense, h² calculations) and how it differs from common misconceptions would deeply enrich comprehension of why the 88% vs 41% numbers matter</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Twin studies are the foundational methodology that produced the 50-80% heritability estimates being debated. Understanding their assumptions, limitations, and why they might overestimate genetic effects is crucial to evaluating both sides&#039; arguments</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how traditional molecular genetic studies only found 10-20% heritability by examining common variants (0.1% of genome). GWAS methodology and its limitations explain why rare variants were &#039;missing&#039; and why GREML-WGS represents a methodological advance</p>
