        <p>Taylor Swift may be the most popular artist in America but globally the top spot this year goes to Bad Bunny. With more than 19.8 billion streams, he is Spotify’s most-played artist of 2025, ahead of Taylor, The Weeknd, Drake and Billie Eilish. His album, <em>Debí Tirar Más Fotos</em>, was also the year’s biggest – paving the way for him to perform at next year’s Super Bowl.</p><p>For a bettor who goes by the name <a href="https://x.com/Domahhhh">Domer</a> on the internet, this was good news. Earlier this year, he bet just over $100,000 that Bad Bunny would reign supreme and, with the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-12-03/wrapped-bad-bunny-top-artist-album/">release</a> of the Spotify rankings this week, he booked a profit of $96,000. A side bet that Taylor Swift <em>wouldn’t</em> be the top Spotify artist of 2025 netted him a further $6,000. Several smaller, lower conviction bets lost him money but, overall, Domer cleared $87,000 wagering on people’s Spotify streaming habits.</p><p>Domer doesn’t just bet on music. He’s interested in politics and economics and culture. As one of the biggest users of prediction platform Polymarket, he’s placed over $420 million of bets since becoming a customer in 2022. One of his biggest wins was on JD Vance being nominated as Donald Trump’s running mate in 2024. His insight that Trump would choose a candidate with a monosyllabic surname persuaded him to put close to $120,000 down on an outcome initially priced as a 2% longshot.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> Elsewhere, he correctly predicted that the Federal Reserve would cut rates by half a percentage point in September 2024 – a trade which earned him $150,000.</p><p>Since registering with Polymarket, Domer <a href="https://polymarket.com/@ImJustKen">has made</a> $2.4 million in profit. “I don’t think of myself as a gambler,” he <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/polymarket-ceo-shayne-coplan-online-betting-platform-60-minutes-transcript/">told</a> CBS News’ 60 Minutes this week. “I’m taking very, very well-researched views on things. I feel like it’s much more akin to investing.” Current exposures span Time magazine’s person of the year (he doesn’t think it will be the Pope), the next Federal Reserve chair (no announcement until next year), and box office receipts on the new Avatar movie (not as big as Wicked).</p><p>Domer is one of a growing band of people using prediction markets to express views across a range of events. Polymarket, founded in 2020, now has around 500,000 <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/decentralized-finance/prediction-markets-and-betting/polymarket-active-traders-monthly">monthly active users</a>, though until recently it was banned in the US.
