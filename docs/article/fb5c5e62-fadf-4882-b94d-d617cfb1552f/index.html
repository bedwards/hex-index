You have lived infinitely many lives in the past and will live infinitely many more in the future. While alive, you are embodied; in between lives, you exist as a disembodied soul.</p><p>[ *Based on: “Disembodied Souls Are People Too,” pp. 138-153 in <em>Extreme Philosophy</em>, ed. Stephen Hetherington (Routledge, 2024). ]</p><h1>1. People Have Souls</h1><h3>1.1. Minds are non-physical</h3><p>These are controversial views, and I can’t fully discuss any of these debates here; here, I will just very briefly summarize my views. I think the mind has three features that are hard to explain in physical terms:</p><ul><li><p>a. Qualia (the particular way experiences feel from the inside).</p></li><li><p>b. Intrinsic intentionality (the feature of representing things or being “about” things).</p></li><li><p>c. Free will (the ability to control which of a set of genuinely open alternatives is realized).</p></li></ul><p>These make it seem that the mind must be something over and above the physical phenomena of the body and the brain.</p><h3>1.2. Properties or substances?</h3><p>Is there a non-physical entity, “the mind”, wherein the above properties reside, or is it merely that a certain physical entity (the brain) has certain non-physical properties?</p><p>I favor the former view (“substance dualism”) because I think it best accommodates very strong and widespread intuitions about personal identity. Roughly, I think there are objective, intrinsic facts about personal identity (e.g., whether a particular future person <em>is you</em> or is instead someone else); also, personal identity is a one-one relation (it is metaphysically impossible for more than one person existing at a given time to both “be you”). </p><p>I think the soul theory of personal identity (you are wherever your soul is) accommodates these intuitions, and I think no theory that relies only on physical entities, even supplemented with non-physical <em>qualities</em>, can accommodate these intuitions. </p><p>Ex.: spatiotemporal and psychological continuity don’t account for identity because of “fission” cases (hypothetical cases in which a person divides into two qualitatively indistinguishable persons). The continuity theory would violate the principle that identity is one-one.</p><p>You can rule out such cases by stipulating that identity requires continuity <em>plus</em> no branching, but then you have to give up the principle that personal identity is intrinsic (the identity of a person should not be dependent on the existence or qualities of <em>other</em> beings).</p><p>The “soul”, then, is understood as the immaterial </p>...</source>
