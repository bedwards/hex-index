        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions UE as an exemplary rank-and-file union model. Learning about this union&#039;s unique democratic structure, its history of being expelled from the CIO during McCarthyism for alleged communist ties, and its survival as an independent union provides valuable context for alternative labor organizing models.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;the neoliberal project&#039; and &#039;the new neoliberal project&#039; as forces reshaping education into markets with families as customers. Understanding neoliberalism&#039;s economic philosophy, its historical development from the 1970s onward, and its impact on public institutions helps readers grasp the ideological framework the authors are critiquing.</p>
