He is the author of a new book — <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/59723">Capitalizing on College: How Higher Education Went From Mission Driven to Margin Obsessed</a> — published by Oxford University Press. I met Josh at a workshop a few months ago on the current state of U.S. universities. As part of THB’s continuing focus on the many dimensions of the challenges and opportunities facing U.S. universities (see the recent <a href="https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/fixing-universities">five-part THB series</a>), I invited Josh to publish a guest post here at THB, drawing upon his new book focusing on how tuition-driven univesities balance budgets while trying to keep true to their mission.

A board member at another school framed the tension as an impossible battle:</p><p>Those two things fight each other. If all we wanted to do was to be deeply mission-conscious and make sure our students have wonderful experiences things would spiral out of control rapidly and we would be out of business.
