Hoffman II in his book, ‘Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare.”</em></p><p>-Doug Moench, <em>Big Book of Conspiracies</em></p><p>I hope you’re not butthurt by the title, I’m right in this with you. Even for an initiate of conspiratorial literature and revisionist history, <em>Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare</em> is hard to stomach and process. The events of history detailed in the book are nothing new: The JFK assassination, NASA conspiracies, Oklahoma City Bombing etc. These are all very familiar topics to this brand of writing but you’ve never read anything about them that took this angle, unless you’re a reader of James Shelby Downer or Hoffman himself you will be enlightened on each page you absorb. Like Dave McGowan’s <em>Programmed to Kill </em>that was covered previously in another article of mine, you will find what’s being presented here hard to believe but also hard to argue with.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </p><p>Possibly the most important aspect of <em>Secret </em>is that much of the conspiratorial culture; in all of its aspects is actually designed to cause despair and helplessness or in modern parlance “blackpilling”. It is also truly remarkable that Hoffman wrote the original addition of the book in 1995 with it being updated in 2001, the book could have been written in 2025 and it would be as relevant, prescient and fresh as it was 30 years ago. Since the books publication, Hoffman has only been proven more correct. Harvard Law professor Cass Sunstein was given a role in the Obama administration as Administrator of The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs based on his article <em>“Conspiracy Theories: Cause and Cures”</em>. Which not only advocates for censorship and “fact-checkers” but the intentional creation of false conspiracies to induce the very mental state Hoffman describes.  <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p><em>“Modern people are fascinated with exposes of sex, violence and Satanism and fascination is itself a form of mind control if we recognize that often times obsessive treatments of these themes under the guise of “exposing them” are the very means of inducing interest and involvement in the occult. People who never hear about Satanism, extreme violence and extreme pornography are unlikely to become involved with Satanism, violence and pornography.”</em> (pg.34) </p><p>Topics like the JFK Assassination or 9/11 can be studied daily for decades or even a lifetime and the “final answer” or resolution will never be found, </p>...</source>
