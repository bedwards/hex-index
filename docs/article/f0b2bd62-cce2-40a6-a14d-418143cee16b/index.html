Since then, the Trump administration has launched at least 20 more lawless strikes – as the United States lurches closer to a full-on invasion of Venezuela.</p><p>With the Trump administration’s rapid escalation, it has become easy for Americans to lose sight of how radical and dangerous the administration’s attacks have been. While the administration has posted partial footage of the attacks, accompanied by gloats, officials have not publicly acknowledged all the strikes; some have remained entirely unannounced. But we won’t allow the Trump regime to overwhelm Americans and normalize its <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/second-strike-all-of-the-us-strikes">illegal strikes</a>. </p><p>Take a look at our tracker of the administration’s <a href="https://zeteo.com/p/second-strike-all-of-the-us-strikes">lawless military strikes</a> on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific:</p><p><strong>September 2, 2025</strong> – US strikes killed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-kills-11-people-strike-alleged-drug-boat-venezuela-trump-says-2025-09-03/">11</a> people allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela. This first boat attack has since been revealed to have involved a double-tap strike. The military launched a second attack killing two shipwrecked men who had survived the initial strike. The administration <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115136798909755892">posted</a> <em>some </em>footage of the attack.</p><p>A small group of lawmakers, though, have been shown video of the second attack, which experts have called a potential war crime. Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-briefing-congress-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats/">told</a> reporters that what he saw in that footage “was one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in my time in public service,” adding: “You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States.”</p><p>The boat was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/politics/suriname-boat-strike-bradley">revealed</a> to be heading to Suriname – not to the United States as Trump had claimed. </p><p><strong>September 15, 2025 – </strong>A US strike killed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-struck-another-alleged-venezuelan-drug-vessel-killing-three-2025-09-15/">three</a> people on a boat that Trump also described as a Venezuelan drug vessel heading towards the US. The White House <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1967684810106868197?s=20">posted</a> footage of this attack. The family of one of the victims, a Colombian man, has filed the first formal legal challenge against the US strikes. Filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human </p>...</source>
