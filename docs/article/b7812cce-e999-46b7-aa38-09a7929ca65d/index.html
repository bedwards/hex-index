        <p>Brazil is a dream market for global ride-sharing companies. Massive population. High urban mobility demand. A transport system built around cars.</p><p>But it’s also a market that’s chewed up and spat out some of the world’s biggest players. <a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/walmart-journey-brazil-rise-decline-acquisition/">Walmart tried for decades</a>. Starbucks nearly left. And in ride-sharing, the story is no different.</p><p>Today, Brazil’s ride-sharing landscape is essentially a <strong>duopoly</strong>. Uber holds roughly 50% of the market, and 99 — backed by Didi Chuxing — runs neck and neck. Smaller players like Bolt and InDrive have a presence but remain on the margins.</p><p>As <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Luiz Fittipaldi&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:19827353,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/554c07e3-452f-4a86-bfbf-10ebe4cef970_800x800.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;bfbacc59-d812-4df2-82e9-8fd23a018338&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>, former global strategist at Bolt, put it during our conversation:</p><blockquote><p>“Ride-hailing in Brazil is a zero-sum game. If you’re not first or second, it’s very hard to build a sustainable business.”</p></blockquote><p>The country’s <strong>infrastructure gap</strong> is one reason the market is so attractive — and so tough. Most trips are made by private cars and taxis, not public transport. </p><p>Add São Paulo’s infamous traffic (among the worst in the world), and you have a population that relies heavily on ride-sharing to move around.</p><p>Then comes the <strong>regulatory and payment puzzle</strong>. Luiz explained how in Latin America, global players expanded with what he called “cowboy style” — moving fast with little pushback. But entering a market like Brazil today isn’t as simple. </p><p>Regulations are stricter. Payments are fragmented. And while Sweden has gone almost fully cashless, Brazil remains a mixed economy of cash, cards, and Pix — the instant payment system launched by the central bank.</p><blockquote><p>“You can’t just drop the same product in Brazil and expect it to work,” Luiz said. “You have to adapt to how people actually pay, move, and live.”</p></blockquote><p>Despite the hurdles, the market is massive. And where big cities are saturated, smaller <strong>tier-2 and tier-3 cities</strong> are opening new doors for challengers. Companies like InDrive are leaning on transparency and lower commissions to win over drivers in places the incumbents overlook.</p><blockquote><p>“If you want to compete in Brazil’s biggest cities, you’re looking at hundreds of millions,” Luiz added. “If you can’t, then you need to find the cracks — and build from there.”</p></blockquote><p>This conversation is about more than Brazil. It’s about what happens when global strategies meet local realities — and why frontier markets are rewriting the playbook.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>You can also watch the episode on Spotify </p><p><a href="https://spotifycreators-web.app.link/e/vgLUPpHvsXb">https://spotifycreators-web.app.link/e/vgLUPpHvsXb</a></p></div><p>Main photo: By Núcleo Editorial - Uber e ...</p>
