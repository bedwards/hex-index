        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article identifies Carney&#039;s 2015 speech as the pivotal moment that &#039;launched the climate-risk industrial complex.&#039; Understanding his background as Governor of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, and his role in shaping global financial policy on climate, provides essential context for the article&#039;s argument.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Cited as one of three significant events in developing the notion of &#039;climate risk,&#039; this 2006 UK government report on the economics of climate change was foundational to the financial framing of climate as an economic threat. Understanding its methodology and reception illuminates the intellectual origins of the climate-risk framework the article critiques.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how the BIS hosts the Financial Stability Board and issued the &#039;green swan&#039; report. This institution, often called the &#039;central bank of central banks,&#039; plays a little-understood but crucial role in global financial regulation. Readers would benefit from understanding its unique position in the international financial system.</p>
