We know that enclosure enables monopolists to raise prices and maximize their profits (consider the rental market, the US healthcare system, or the British rail system). But it also has another effect. When essential goods are privatized and expensive, people need more income than they would otherwise require to access them. To get it they are compelled to increase their labour in capitalist markets, working to produce new things that may <em>not</em> be needed (with increased energy use, resource use, and ecological pressure) simply to access things that clearly <em>are </em>needed, and which are quite often <em>already there</em>.</p><p>Take housing, for example. If your rent goes up, you suddenly have to work more just to keep the same roof over your head. At an economy-wide level, this dynamic means we need more aggregate production — more growth — in order to meet basic needs. From the perspective of capital, this ensures a steady flow of labour for private firms, and maintains downward pressure on wages to facilitate capital accumulation. For the rest of us it means needless exploitation, insecurity, and ecological damage. Artificial scarcity also creates growth dependencies: because survival is mediated by prices and wages, when productivity improvements and recessions lead to unemployment people suffer loss of access to essential goods — even when the output of those goods is not affected — and growth is needed to create new jobs and resolve the social crisis.</p><p>There is a way out of this trap: by decommodifying<em> </em>essential goods and services, we can eliminate artificial scarcity and ensure public abundance, de-link human well-being from growth, and reduce growthist pressures.</p><p>This approach also has several other direct social and ecological benefits. For one, it can have a strong positive impact on human welfare. We know from empirical studies that public services are a powerful driver of improvements in life expectancy, well-being, and other key social indicators (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25150379/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616305858?ref=pdf_download&amp;fr=RR-2&amp;rr=7205e6398be411b7">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953606000621">here</a>).
