        <p>Hi all,</p><p>One of the most difficult tasks that European states and the EU institutionally have is learning to think on their own. They have over decades of inactivity, mostly lost the ability to think strategically on their own behalf; to judge what they need to do with their own resources to defend their own interests. You might think of it as European strategic muscles having atrophied from lack of use.</p><p>As Europe’s strategic muscles have atrophied, what replaced it was reliance on the USA to do much of Europe’s strategic thinking. Europeans could sit back, enjoy their welfare states, early retirement ages and social benefits, snug in the knowledge that if anything truly dangerous happened, big daddy USA would be there to keep the bad guys at bay. Yes, Europeans might chafe at this inferiority, might even comfort themselves by saying that they were very clever and had outsourced their security for little cost, but ultimately they were happy to accept this strategic infantilization.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png" width="769" height="497" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:497,&quot;width&quot;:769,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:432869,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://phillipspobrien.substack.com/i/181125050?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FWSD!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69070e26-1592-44d3-ac9d-a612fc6188d4_769x497.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Until now that  is, when the enormous danger of that infantilization is staring Europe squarely in the face.
