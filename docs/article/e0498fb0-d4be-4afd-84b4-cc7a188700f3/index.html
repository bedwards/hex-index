This phenomenon of extreme work culture in China, formalized as &#039;996&#039;, provides essential context for understanding the systemic pressures discussed</p>

        <p><em>Zilan Qian is a program associate (research) at the Oxford China Policy Lab and holds a Master’s degree in Social Science of the Internet from the University of Oxford.</em></p><p><em>Trigger warning: the second half of this article explores suicide.</em></p><p>“The US-China AI race is a race between Chinese — those in the US vs. those in China.”</p><p>This joke has real-world references. It is no secret that Chinese engineers and researchers make up a meaningful percentage of the AI workforce in the US. According to the Paulson Institute’s <a href="https://archivemacropolo.org/interactive/digital-projects/the-global-ai-talent-tracker/">Global AI Talent Tracker 2.0</a>, by 2022, US institutions relied more on Chinese AI researchers (38%) compared to US AI researchers (37%). Yet, this tracker still underestimates the Chinese AI talents in the US, because researchers are only counted as Chinese if their undergraduate degree is from a Chinese institution. That excludes a massive number of China-born AI researchers who did their undergraduate degrees in the US.</p><p>Meanwhile, China’s own AI progress, almost 100% powered by China-born Chinese, has grown at an unmatched pace. Besides the industry performance that can compete with the US, in 2024, <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Deepseek_and_the_New_Geopolitics_of_AI/29336588">China’s AI research publication</a> output matched the combined output of the US, UK, and European Union, and now commands more than 40% of global citation attention.</p><p>People often cite China’s talent pipeline as one of its most valuable strategic resources — a system to admire or even emulate. Unfortunately, this view is fundamentally wrong. The system is highly inefficient, with a low cost-return rate: the top STEM genius everyone sees at the summit is built upon the bodies of massive numbers of talented students who failed to reach the top.</p><p>This piece is not about the life stories of successful Chinese AI or STEM talents. It is not about how the talent system works — but about how it does not. It explores the price paid to create this talent pool and the untold mental health stories behind it, as experienced and witnessed by me.</p><h1>How to Build an “AI Talent Pipeline”</h1><p>I grew up in Hangzhou, which is known today as one of <a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/how-hangzhou-spawned-deepseek-and">China’s booming AI and robotics hubs</a>. I went to some of the city’s top middle and high schools, the kinds of places that sit at the center of the country’s STEM pipeline. A middle school senior several years ahead of me became the co-founder of xAI, and another high school ...</p>
