        <p class="topic-summary">The article is a deep meditation on Scott Adams and his comic strip Dilbert, analyzing its cultural significance, the &#039;nerd experience&#039; it captured, and how it reflected workplace dynamics of the 80s-90s. The Wikipedia article on Dilbert itself would provide valuable context about the strip&#039;s history, characters, publication run, and cultural impact that complements this personal reflection.</p>

      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Thanks to everyone who sent in condolences on my recent death from prostate cancer at age 68, but that was Scott Adams. I (Scott Alexander) am still alive<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>. </p><p>Still, the condolences are appreciated. Scott Adams was a surprisingly big part of my life. I may be the only person to have read every <em>Dilbert </em>book before graduating elementary school<em>. </em>For some reason, 10-year-old-Scott found Adams’ stories of time-wasting meetings and pointy-haired bosses hilarious. No doubt some of the attraction came from a more-than-passing resemblance between Dilbert’s nameless corporation and the California public school system. We’re all inmates in prisons with different names.</p><p>But it would be insufficiently ambitious to stop there. Adams’ comics were about the nerd experience. About being cleverer than everyone else, not just in the sense of being high IQ, but in the sense of being the only sane man in a crazy world where everyone else spends their days listening to overpaid consultants drone on about mission statements instead of doing anything useful. There’s an arc in Dilbert where the boss disappears for a few weeks and the engineers get to manage their own time. Productivity shoots up. Morale soars. They invent warp drives and time machines. Then the boss returns, and they’re back to being chronically behind schedule and over budget. This is the nerd outlook in a nutshell: if <em>I</em> ran the circus, there’d be some changes around here.</p><p>Yet the other half of the nerd experience is: for some reason this never works. Dilbert and his brilliant co-workers are stuck watching from their cubicles while their idiot boss racks in bonuses and accolades. If humor, like religion, is an opiate of the masses, then Adams is masterfully unsubtle about what type of wound his art is trying to numb. </p><p>This is the basic engine of <em>Dilbert</em>: everyone is rewarded in exact inverse proportion to their virtue. Dilbert and Alice are brilliant and hard-working, so they get crumbs. Wally is brilliant but lazy, so he at least enjoys a fool’s paradise of endless coffee and donuts while his co-workers clean up his messes. The P.H.B. is neither smart nor industrious, so he is forever on top, reaping the rewards of everyone else’s toil. Dogbert, an inveterate scammer with a passing resemblance to various trickster deities, makes out best of all. </p><p>The repressed object at the bottom of the nerd subconscious, ...</p>
