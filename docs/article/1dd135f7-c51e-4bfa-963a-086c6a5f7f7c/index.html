      <p><span>I reflected on my best reading experiences of the year earlier this week, and I had a lot to share. Honestly, I needed to cut myself off because this has been a really great year of reading, particularly when it comes to </span><em>how</em><span> I’m approaching my books. But there were a few less than great bookish endeavors I took on this year, and those taught me a lot as well. Today I’m sharing a few of the things that just didn’t work in my reading life in 2025 and how I’m taking what I’ve learned into the new year.</span></p><h4 class="header-anchor-post">Four less-than-stellar reading experiences in 2025<div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-alignItems-center pc-position-absolute pc-reset header-anchor-parent"><div class="pencraft pc-display-contents pc-reset pubTheme-yiXxQA"><div id="§four-less-than-stellar-reading-experiences-in" class="pencraft pc-reset header-anchor offset-top"></div></div></div></h4><ol><li><p><strong>Feeling betrayed by blurbs and marketing copy.</strong><span> I’m not new to how the book marketing world works so I know not to rely too much on what I find in the publisher’s pitch copy or author blurbs.

But sometimes, the description is so heinously wrong or the blurbs so incandescently positive that it is impossible not to be affected. </span></p></li></ol>
