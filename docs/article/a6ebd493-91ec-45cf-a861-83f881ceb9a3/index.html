        <p>On the first morning of autumn, on the first morning it really <em>felt</em> like autumn, with the sun low in the crisp air and the leaves scattered across the ground, I woke up to find a dying bird in my living room.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons there shouldn’t be a dying bird in my living room, and one of those reasons is that I’m bad at bird ID so I can’t even write about the damn thing in a satisfying way.
