        <p>How committed is the Trump administration to erasing the history of slavery? Last month, the National Park Service removed exhibits about slavery from the Philadelphia site where George Washington—and some of the people he enslaved—and John Adams lived before the capital moved to D.C. A judge ordered them to restore the exhibits. And now the administration has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/slavery-exhibits-presidents-house-site-philadelphia-orders/">appealed the ruling</a>.</p><p>“The National Park Service routinely updates exhibits across the park system to ensure historical accuracy and completeness,” the Department of the Interior said in a statement. “Completeness” is doing some interesting work there.</p><p>Programming note: Our shows tonight and tomorrow at the Pantages Theatre in Minneapolis are pretty much sold out, but there’s a <a href="https://hennepinarts.org/events/the-bulwark-live-minneapolis-2026">smattering</a> of tickets left if you’re in the neighborhood and want to squeak in under the wire. It’s been an amazing couple of few months in Minnesota—we look forward to seeing some of you there tonight. <em><strong>Happy Wednesday.</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg" width="1456" height="965" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:965,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6782813,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/i/188376581?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OXJS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7e3bf62-c9c5-4849-8e49-f2165a87e7c1_3600x2386.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Federal immigration agents and St. Paul Police officers stand at the scene after a multiple-vehicle accident involving an apparent pursuit by federal officers in St. Paul on Wednesday, February 11, 2026.

As you’ve perhaps guessed, I was firmly in the latter group. And so I was pleased when the Minnesota Twins won the American League pennant in 1965, deposing the mighty Yankees, who’d been AL champs for fifteen of the preceding eighteen seasons.</p><p>My affection for the Twins only increased when they lost a dramatic seven-game World Series to the Dodgers and Sandy Koufax, who pitched complete-game shutouts in the fifth and seventh games, the latter on two days’ rest. So I was grateful to the Minnesotans both for winning the regular season and losing in the Series.</p><p>Three years later, in 1968, Minnesotans reappeared on my horizon. I spent part of my summer between tenth and eleventh grade as a volunteer for Hubert Humphrey’s presidential campaign.
