That was a few weeks ago! There is of course very very very little good about Donald Trump, but it’s convenient that he just says the quiet parts out loud, and what he has said, <em>explicitly</em>, is that we have no intention of allowing democracy in Venezuela and that we’re there to exploit its oil reserves. Look up his quotes and see! Trump is a sublimely evil person, just a complete moral failure in every respect, but it’s ultimately good that we can be adults and discuss what’s happening in Venezuela honestly. We don’t care about Venezuelan democracy, we’re going to run the country as long as we want, we’ll never allow a government hostile to the United States or its monetary interests to rule no matter how popular, and we’re doing it for the oil. At least we can have honesty, for once, about why this country does what it does. We don’t care about democracy and human rights, we never have, and we’re not about to start now.</p><p>And what fries my noodle, what I find just gobsmacking, is the number of people from all across the political spectrum who believe mere weeks after the Venezuela intervention that the United States is going to intervene in Iran in a way that leads to authentic and real Iranian democracy. My friends, what part of American history, including extremely recent history, do you not understand?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png" width="359" height="429.03339191564146" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:680,&quot;width&quot;:569,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:359,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7b4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb96cd24f-4007-4b09-b557-d6c479a6b148_569x680.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>What’s happening in Iran?
