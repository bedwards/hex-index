        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Czech-Sinology programs steeped in history.

        <p>In this episode, Jared sits down with <strong>Renata Mirkova</strong>, a Chinese language educator from the Czech Republic whose journey into Mandarin began not with a grand plan, but almost by accident. What started as a university entrance decision led her to master Chinese, live in China, and now teach both Czech and Chinese across cultural boundaries.</p><p>Renata shares the <strong>unique challenges of learning Chinese in a non-English-speaking environment</strong>, including outdated textbooks from the 60s, Czech-Sinology programs steeped in history, and a lack of direct Chinese-to-Czech resources. But through her perseverance and multiple immersive experiences in China, Renata carved out her own path to fluency.</p><p>From surviving the linguistic chaos of Sichuan dialects to interpreting for Czech officials on business trips in China, she offers candid reflections on what works for her, what didn’t, and how learning Chinese changed her life. She also gives insight into her current work creating Chinese learning materials specifically for Czech speakers and what it’s like teaching Czech to Chinese speakers in return.</p><p><strong>Links from the episode:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.renatamirkova.com/">⁠Learn Chinese with Renata Mirkova⁠</a> | Website</p></li><li><p><a href="https://mandarincompanion.com/products/">⁠Mandarin Companion Graded Readers</a></p></li></ul>
