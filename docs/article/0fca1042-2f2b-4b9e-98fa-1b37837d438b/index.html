          <strong>Novichok</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions this military-grade nerve agent as the poison used in the Skripal assassination attempt. Understanding its development by the Soviet Union, its chemical properties, and why it&#039;s considered one of the deadliest nerve agents ever created provides crucial context for the severity of Russia&#039;s actions.</p>

          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">While mentioned in the article, readers would benefit from understanding Skripal&#039;s full background as a Russian military intelligence officer who became a double agent for Britain&#039;s MI6, the circumstances of his exposure and prisoner exchange, and why Russia would target him years after his release.</p>

          <strong>Illegals Program</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references &#039;The Americans&#039; TV show and mentions a real spy resurfacing. The Illegals Program was the actual FBI operation that inspired the show, involving Russian sleeper agents living as Americans for decades. This provides fascinating context for both the TV reference and Russia&#039;s ongoing espionage operations discussed in the article.</p>
