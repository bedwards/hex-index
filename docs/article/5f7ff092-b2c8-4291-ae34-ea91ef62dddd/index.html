        <p>In the last few days there have been a number of very worrying story for US democracy that received hardly any attention. It seems that <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/big-changes-agency-charged-securing-125007698.html">the US government agency that advises states on how to thwart cybersecurity threats intended to undermine the integrity of American elections and which helps states to cope with foreign interference in elections, has basically ceased to function</a>. It no longer is showing up for meetings, working with, or even advising state governments in the run-up to the vital 2026 mid-term elections. This is leaving those states wondering if they will receive any support to combat attempts to subvert the vote or whether the Federal government even cares.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg" width="1456" height="992" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:992,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8_HY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28f3e237-700b-47e5-880f-fcd95cbb6b7b_3072x2094.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Why Do People Try To Protect Trump?</figcaption></figure></div><p>At the same time, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/23/us/politics/trump-florida-cannon-grand-jury.html">US Attorney in Miami seems to have opted for an entirely biased system to go after Trump’s supposed enemies</a>.

While accusing political opponents of sedition (and threatening them with death or long-term imprisonment) he also showed his support for the <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/document/fact-sheet-save-act-threatens-all-voters">GOP SAVE act, which is aimed at disenfranchising millions of legal voters by mandating detailed documentation to prove citizenship at the polling places</a>.</p><p>While Trump was gearing up his campaign to try and pervert the 2026 election, his government was in the midst of trying to foist a “peace” deal on Ukraine that was written at least partly by Vladimir Putin’s government. This deal, which involved negotiations and approval from Trump’s son in law (Kushner), his close business partner (Witkoff) his Vice-President (Vance) and which the President himself sanctioned, is one of the most sordid deals in US foreign policy history. It would defenestrate Ukraine as a sovereign state, provide Ukraine no real security going forward, reward Russia for its aggression, and protect Putin from any repercussions in the future.</p><p>And yet, what we hear is not outright condemnation of Trump and his frankly malevolent plans but, disconcertingly, a chorus of excuses on his behalf; attempts to say that he did not know and, ultimately was not responsible for </p></source>...</source>
