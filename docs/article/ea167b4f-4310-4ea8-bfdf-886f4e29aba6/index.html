        <p>For years, rideshare drivers with Uber have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/04/uber-drivers-tell-senate-inquiry-of-abuse-false-complaints-and-suspensions-during-covid">complained</a> about wrongful deactivations of their account, which essentially force these workers to take unpaid time off with the potential risk of termination. There are attorneys who <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=a72afbd4bc67f031JmltdHM9MTY1OTEzOTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wODQyZGNhZC01ODRjLTYyYTEtMzk2NC1jZDg5NTk2NTYzOTAmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMg&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0842dcad-584c-62a1-3964-cd8959656390&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG9zYW5nZWxlc2VtcGxveW1lbnRhdHRvcm5leS5vcmcvdWJlci13cm9uZ2Z1bC1kZWFjdGl2YXRpb24tbGF3eWVyLw&amp;ntb=1">advertise </a>seeking clients for this specific issue. </p><p>Robert Eaton has worked as an Uber driver full-time in Reno, Nevada for three years. He recently just invested in an electric vehicle to try to increase his income as a rideshare driver, as he’s worked 60 hours a week or more for the past three years trying to support his family, which include four children, ages 18, 13, 12, and 9, three of whom have special needs. </p><p>Earlier this month, Uber sent him an email that his driving account was to be deactivated over a false accusation from a rider that he was driving under the influence, even though he has dashcam footage from the periods where the allegation was made. Riders will often make a complaint about a driver falsely, as Uber often reimburses them in some way for the ride, or retaliation for a driver pushing back on poor behavior. In 2020, CNET <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/uber-drivers-are-losing-their-jobs-over-fake-dui-complaints/">reported</a> on the issue of Uber deactivating drivers over false DUI complaints. It appears Uber hasn’t bothered to resolve the issue, among several facing workers in the rideshare industry who are classified as independent contractors yet bound to the policies and varying rates unilaterally implemented by these companies. </p><p>Eaton speculated the complaint came from an intoxicated passenger who he asked not to vomit in his car as he experienced an incident where a passenger did so a week prior. He’s made over 15,000 trips for Uber and 3,000 deliveries with Uber Eats in his three years working for Uber. </p><p>“I am the only worker in our family. I would never think of jeopardizing my family and the safety of my passengers with drugs or Alcohol,” said Eaton. “It has scared me and my family so much. I had no idea that we would lose my job and we are close to losing everything if I cannot get my job back. I am scared to death, there has never been a place in my life where I had the rug pulled out from under me so hard.”</p><p>Eaton is currently appealing the deactivation where he could finally submit video footage from his driver facing dashcam, but the appeal process takes several days.
