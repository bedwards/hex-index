As I went to log the movie on Letterboxd, I noticed something rather unfortunate among my last five reviews:</p><ul><li><p>I awarded <em>One Battle After Another</em>—a virtuosic masterpiece and presumptive Best Picture winner—four and a half stars (out of five).</p></li><li><p>Two weeks earlier, I gave <em>Scary Movie 3</em> a perfect five-star rating.</p></li></ul><p>You can probably tell from context clues that <em>Scary Movie 3</em> neither qualifies as a virtuosic masterpiece nor was it a Best Picture contender. There is, however, a running gag in this film where aliens urinate out of their index fingers.</p><p>My apologies to the film bros who’ve seen <em>One Battle After Another</em> four times and are pathologically compelled to describe their Blu-ray collection to strangers. That said, I stand by my five-star rating of a horror spoof sequel from the mid-2000s. Sure, some may write off <em>Scary Movie 3 </em>as “bad” or “dumb”—and they wouldn’t be wrong—but I love the film anyway. In fact, the stupidity heightens my enjoyment, which is why it was my favorite movie when I was 11 years old.</p><p>To consciously appreciate something “bad”—like an entry from the <em>Scary Movie</em> franchise—you have to hold two competing ideas in your mind. The first is that a film falls well short of cinematic greatness, sometimes intentionally but mostly by accident. The second is that the movie is eminently enjoyable, often as a result of these flaws. But not every lackluster film strikes the rare alchemical balance of being “so bad that it’s good.”</p><p>So today, we’ll explore the films that managed to achieve lasting cultural relevance, commercial success, and devoted fanbases—despite being widely dismissed as mediocre (or worse). We’ll then combine these criteria to create <em>a definitive ranking</em> of cinema’s best “bad” movies.</p><h1>Bad Films with Lasting Cultural Relevance</h1><p>Most subpar movies are either little-seen or widely panned before subsequently getting memory-holed. No one discusses the cultural implications of <em>Yes Day</em> and <em>Ghosted</em>, or whether <em>Central Intelligence</em> and <em>The Internship</em> reshaped commercial appetites. Odds are, you read that last sentence and were unsure whether those movies actually exist (like the film equivalent of “two truths and a lie”). Well, surprise—they’re all real and they’re all less-than-stellar.</p><p>But </p>...</source>
