I’ve been moving, then immediately after unpacking, packing up again for a temporary move for a temporary out-of-town job, while trying to finish the articles I did my research for this summer about the Chesapeake Bay and the lie of green growth, while going through a really intensive but oh-so-healpful cycle of therapy, and on the side, preparing for a big huge trip to Brazil to work with some comrades there – anarchists, organized workers, communities belonging to the Landless Workers Movement, and (to be clear all of these categories overlap) members of the Ka’apor and other Amazonian indigenous peoples.
