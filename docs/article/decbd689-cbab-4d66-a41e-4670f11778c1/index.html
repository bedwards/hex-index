        <p class="topic-summary">HOME reforms typically aim to legalize &#039;missing middle&#039; housing types like duplexes, triplexes, and small apartment buildings that were common before mid-20th century zoning but have since been prohibited in most American neighborhoods. This concept is central to understanding what the Austin reforms are trying to achieve.</p>
