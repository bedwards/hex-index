        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses HOME zoning reforms in Austin. Understanding Euclidean zoning—the traditional American zoning system that separates residential, commercial, and industrial uses—provides essential context for why cities like Austin are now reforming their zoning codes to allow more housing types.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">HOME reforms typically aim to legalize &#039;missing middle&#039; housing types like duplexes, triplexes, and small apartment buildings that were common before mid-20th century zoning but have since been prohibited in most American neighborhoods. This concept is central to understanding what the Austin reforms are trying to achieve.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The historical and social context of why American cities adopted restrictive single-family zoning—often to exclude lower-income residents and minorities—helps readers understand the equity arguments driving modern zoning reform movements like Austin&#039;s HOME initiative.</p>

The show, "Neighborhood Matters," will focus on urban public policy as well as broader cultural conversations about community-building. If you have ideas for guests (yourself included!) let me know! I'm not looking for credentials as much as interesting conversations with people <strong><u>who are not afraid to</u><u> speak frankly</u></strong>. </em></p><p>Right before Thanksgiving the Department of Development Services <a href="https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=463145&amp;ref=austinpolitics.net" rel="noreferrer">published a report</a> on the HOME zoning reforms approved by City Council at the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024. </p><p>I originally intended to just write something yesterday highlighting the findings of the report, but when I looked closely at the figures, they didn't seem right to me. So I ended up making a bunch of calls and the whole thing took more time than expected. Hence the unusual Friday newsletter. </p>
