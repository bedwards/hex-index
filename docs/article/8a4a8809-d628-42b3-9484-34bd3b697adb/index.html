          <strong>Sagas of Icelanders</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author explicitly cites reading Icelandic sagas as the inspiration for their new writing style, describing it as &#039;a form much older than the short story.&#039; Understanding the literary tradition of these medieval prose narratives illuminates what the author means by writing &#039;tales&#039; rather than modern short stories.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the author&#039;s 22-year relationship with literary journals like Ploughshares, McSweeney&#039;s, and The Kenyon Review. Understanding the history and ecosystem of little magazines—small-circulation literary periodicals that have historically launched major authors—provides essential context for the gatekeeping system the author is critiquing.</p>

          <span class="read-time">9 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author makes a significant philosophical distinction between being a &#039;professional&#039; writer seeking income and becoming an &#039;amateur&#039;—&#039;a person who wrote just for love.&#039; The etymology and history of amateurism, from Latin &#039;amare&#039; (to love), illuminates this identity shift central to the essay&#039;s argument.</p>
