        <p>(The following was originally released as podcast episode #211 on September 22, 2024. Minor edits for clarity. Hope you enjoy! &lt;3)</p><p>Hello everyone! I’m Stephen West. This is <em>Philosophize This!</em><br><br></p><p>So we live in a time where people will do some pretty moronic stuff in the name of their political beliefs.</p><p>We also live in a time where it’s common for people to look at the moronic behavior going on and say, you know, the only reason that person is doing any of that stuff is because they’re a follower of the philosophy of Karl Marx, or Ayn Rand, or Hobbes, or Machiavelli– whoever it is.</p><p>Well, another thinker whose work gets this very same kind of treatment in the modern world is the work of <strong>Friedrich Nietzsche</strong>.</p><p>No shortage of people out there who will cite Friedrich Nietzsche as the inspiration behind their behavior, and there are even more people out there that blame Nietzsche for the behavior of other people that they see as problematic.</p><p>So as the resident guy that has read way too much philosophy in his life and then passes those savings on to you, I want to offer some context to Nietzsche’s work today that we’ve never gone into before.
