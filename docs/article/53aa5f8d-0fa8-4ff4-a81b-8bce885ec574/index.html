        <p>Welcome, valued Consumer, to the Tech Bubble Dispatch #4! This week’s roundup is a short one as I’m trying to focus on finishing up the second half of my <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and">Silicon Valley Consensus essay</a>. </p><p><em>If you like my work and want to support me, consider becoming a paid subscriber for <strong>$7 a month</strong> (the price of a dozen eggs if you’re lucky) or <strong>$70 a year</strong> (the price of a few hardcover books you won’t read)! If you are a bit more well-off, take inspiration from Engels and become a <strong>Tech Bubble financier</strong>. Share this newsletter with someone who you think might like it (or hate it)—and feel free to leave comments here or shoot me an email with further questions!</em></p><ul><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/158855474/song-of-the-week">Song of the week</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/158855474/bookseller-of-the-week">Book(seller) of the week</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/158855474/reading-recommendations">Reading recommendations</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/i/158855474/listening-recommendations">Listening recommendations</a></p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>Song of the week</h2><p>Huge spoiler if you haven’t seen ALL THAT JAZZ considering this is the final dance number. SKIP AHEAD.</p><p>This is a top 5 movie ending for me and if I ever made a film, it would end similar to this though a little bloodier. The movie follows Joe Gideon, a choreographer, theater director, film director, and editor whose life disintegrates as he tries to balance his commitment to work, booze, sex, and family. This builds and builds until heart attacks put him in the hospital, spurring end-of-life dream sequences that culminate in this musical number featuring everyone in his life:</p><div id="youtube2-4XAQ4vFQEJo" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;4XAQ4vFQEJo&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4XAQ4vFQEJo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h2>Book(seller) of the week</h2><p>This is a two for one. Over the past two years, one of the biggest influences on the literature I've been reading has been Stephen E Andrews, a fiction writer who runs the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0HYhM4ijo8&amp;t=127s&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">Outlaw Bookseller Youtube channel</a>. Andrews is a bookseller with an encyclopedic knowledge of science fiction, fantasy, horror, crime fiction, and much more. I can count on one hand how many books in the last two genres I read before finding his channel. Check him out, he’s introduced me to some of my favorite authors and books as well as given new appreciation for genres and the various schools of writers within them and historical contexts for certain stories or turns. </p><p>Here are some videos of his I recommend starting with:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyb8UB1qxoM&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">The WORST of PHILIP K. DICK? Which books to avoid?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDeGSeJ4QO4&amp;ab_channel=OutlawBookseller">William S.
