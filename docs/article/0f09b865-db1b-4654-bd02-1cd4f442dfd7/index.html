We knew Trump was bad; his first term had been a calamity. But few of us were prepared for the catastrophe that awaited us in the second. </p><p>Part of it came because Republicans gained control of both chambers of Congress, and Trump was able to intimidate and browbeat them into submitting to whatever he wanted to do. </p><p>Now, finally, the ground is shifting. </p><p>Some congressional Republicans are turning hawkish on the budget and reject Trump’s zany notion of  $2,000 “tariff dividend” checks, as well as his stated desire to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years.</p><p>Russian hawks dislike Trump’s love fest with Putin on Ukraine. </p><p>Nor did they appreciate his happy meeting with Zohran Mamdani. </p><p>Or his refusal to release the Jeffrey Epstein files. </p><p>Some are demanding to know more about Trump’s and Hegseth’s bombing (and re-bombing) of boats in the Caribbean. </p><p>When Marjorie Taylor Greene decided to pick up her bigotry and leave Congress, I assumed it was because she had picked a fight with Trump and lost. But other Republican members are threatening to depart too — potentially leaving Trump and his puppet Speaker Mike Johnson without enough votes to stop the Democrats. </p><p>Could it be — is it really possible? — that a few congressional Republicans are now feeling their backbones? </p><p>Yes — which is enough for other congressional Republicans to realize they, too, have vertebrae. </p><p>Why<em> now</em>?</p><p>Because the MAGA base that every congressional Republican is so afraid of and solicitous toward is falling apart. </p><p>They’re finally seeing Trump for what he is: a man without principle except getting richer and more powerful and engraving his name on buildings. </p><p>A lame-duck president who said he’d make life better for MAGA starting on “day one” but has made life worse for MAGA by month 10. </p><p>He doesn’t even believe in lowering prices. He calls the affordability crisis a “con” job. </p><p>Democrats swept last month’s off-year elections and performed better than usual in Tuesday’s House race in a bright-red Tennessee district. </p><p>If you’re taking some satisfaction from the MAGA crackup, don’t let your guard down.</p><p>It’s when Trump feels he’s in trouble that he does the biggest and craziest things to deflect attention.  </p><p>So, my friends, beware. </p></source>
