        <p>Hi, friends. I’m writing this on a flight to Houston to attend former Secretary of Education Rod Paige’s funeral. It’s been so heartwarming to see the outpouring of affection for Dr. Paige on social media, and I’m looking forward to visiting with some old friends at the service.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have a jam-packed SCHOOLED for you today—the last of 2025. I’m heading down to Hilton Head, South Carolina, for the holiday to be with my 83-year-old father, his newlywed wife (no kidding!), and the rest of our extended family. I’ll be back in your in-boxes on January 6. I hope you have a restful and rejuvenating break.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox on Tuesday and Friday mornings.

Most of y’all were not convinced. Let’s hear some responses:</p><p><strong>Tim Daly</strong></p><blockquote><p>The measure of any year is whether it was good or bad for kids. It’s very difficult to call 2025 successful given the <a href="https://www.nagb.gov/content/dam/nagb/en/documents/newsroom/press-releases/2025/naep2024-pressrelease-final.pdf">NAEP results released in late January</a>. While some folks had long expected them, I think they were shocking and far from inevitable, given the financial resources available to schools and the return to normal post-Covid school operations by fall 2022. A collective acknowledgement—<a href="https://schooledbymikepetrilli.substack.com/p/was-2025-a-good-year-for-education">most evident among opinion leaders</a>—that our problems starter earlier than 2020 and require a real national response is positive. But when are we going to put actual wins on the board? That’s what I would call a good year.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Van Schoales</strong></p><blockquote><p>Seems far darker than brighter to me, given the following list:</p><ol><li><p>There seems to be no effort or vision for how to better support most low-income kids in the biggest school districts.</p></li><li><p>No major national foundations are seriously investing in improving schools in urban areas, and there are fewer now than the last two decades.</p></li><li><p>Tax credits, vouchers, and ESAs will help some but at best will be a marginal improvement and likely do nothing for those large public systems.</p></li><li><p>Research on impact is less fashionable these days, and the federal chaos will make it super hard to improve the research ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>AI, while great for those with privilege and for </p></li></ol></blockquote>...</source>
