        <p class="topic-summary">Central to the Court&#039;s ruling - this 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws is the key legal framework the majority used to interpret the National Guard statute. Understanding its history and exceptions is essential to grasping why the deployment was blocked.</p>

        <p>Welcome back to “One First,” a weekly newsletter that aims to make the U.S. Supreme Court and related legal topics more accessible to lawyers and non-lawyers alike. I’m grateful to all of you for your continued support—and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:</p><p>Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“<strong>On the Docket</strong>”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“<strong>The </strong><em><strong>One First </strong></em><strong>‘Long Read’”</strong>); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, please consider becoming one. And given that it’s the holiday season, you might also consider whether <a href="https://www.stevevladeck.com/subscribe?gift=true">a gift subscription</a> would be a welcome present (or, at least, an amusing gag) for a friend or family member:</p><p>I wanted to use today’s “Long Read” to take a deep dive into <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a443_ba7d.pdf">the Court’s ruling last Tuesday in </a><em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a443_ba7d.pdf">Trump </a></em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a443_ba7d.pdf">v. </a><em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/25a443_ba7d.pdf">Illinois</a></em>, in which a majority of the justices left in place lower-court rulings barring President Trump from deploying federalized National Guard troops into and around Chicago in response to anti-ICE protests. The decision is, without question, the most significant setback for the Trump administration at the Supreme Court at least since the justices repudiated its effort to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for summary, mass removals back in April. It also features an enigmatic concurrence by Justice Kavanaugh and dissents from Justices Alito and Gorsuch that have been the basis for significant criticism of the Court from the right—critiques that, in my view, are remarkably overblown and/or hypocritical. To make a long story short(er), although I still think the majority could (and should) have explained its ruling in a bit more detail, the Court got a very big one right—in ways that will almost certainly make it more difficult, as it should be, for the Trump administration to attempt to militarize domestic law enforcement based on dubious factual predicates.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png" width="960" height="540" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:540,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1191511,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.stevevladeck.com/i/182848773?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QedB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd6b4639a-0bd2-45bd-8497-a4d35738e467_960x540.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>More on all of this below.
