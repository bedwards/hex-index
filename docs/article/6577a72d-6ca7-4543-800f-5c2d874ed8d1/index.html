Starbucks has denied all allegations of misconduct, while their union avoidance lawyers at Littler Mendelson recently accused the National Labor Relations Board, which has been slow in processing unfair labor practice charges, of favoring the union.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/11/starbucks-union-drive-strikes">Starbucks workers hold strikes in at least 17 states amid union drive | US unions | The Guardian</a></p></source>
