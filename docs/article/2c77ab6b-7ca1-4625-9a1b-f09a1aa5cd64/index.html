        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis is that Way to Win produced a self-serving report that confirms their priors rather than objectively analyzing why Democrats lost. Understanding motivated reasoning - the cognitive bias where people process information in ways that support their existing beliefs - directly illuminates why advocacy groups might produce research that flatters their donors and methods.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens with a quote from Silvio Dante to Tony Soprano about taking responsibility while denying wrongdoing - a perfect metaphor for the report&#039;s stance. Understanding this iconic HBO series and its themes of denial, self-deception, and organized corruption provides rich context for the author&#039;s framing.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references the Supreme Court&#039;s &#039;you know it when you see it&#039; approach when discussing the report&#039;s vague definition of &#039;strength.&#039; This phrase comes from Justice Potter Stewart&#039;s 1964 concurrence on obscenity - understanding its origin and legal context illuminates why the author finds the report&#039;s definitional vagueness problematic.</p>

If so, you might be curious about a new report from a group called <a href="https://waytowin.us/">Way to Win</a>, which bills itself as “a donor collaborative that invests in data-driven strategies to fund new media and grassroots efforts to win long-term political change.” “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8fN1MChC13OYzRni9VZQeOiIwETMW4U/view?usp=sharing">Towards Strength: Way to Win Post-2024 Research Summary</a>” contains some supposedly important news for Democrats and those who want them to win elections in the future: <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/204271/why-democrats-lost-2024-election-trump-way-to-win-report">According to </a><em><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/204271/why-democrats-lost-2024-election-trump-way-to-win-report">The New Republic</a></em> (which got exclusive access to an early copy), the report reveals “the Real Reason Democrats Lost in 2024.”</p><p>Let me go ahead and spoil that part immediately. Most of the report’s arguments about why Harris lost consist of what is now the conventional wisdom: Kamala Harris didn’t have a clear message, she didn’t present herself as a “change” candidate during a “change” election, and so on. (As the authors note, she <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/harris-2024-campaign-biden">couldn’t name a single thing she’d have done differently from Joe Biden</a>, the flailing and unpopular incumbent to whom she was tethered.) All true, but all well-trod terrain. Even the document’s working definition of “strength,” a word that appears in its very title, doesn’t really say much that’s new: “What exactly is strength? As the Supreme Court’s famous approach would suggest: ‘you know it when you see it.’ But as a working definition: political strength is making decisions based on core values and principles, explaining choices with clear and persuasive arguments, drawing a contrast with one’s opponents, and making it clear why your approach is the better one.”</p><p>What are those core values and principles? What are those arguments? This is where things go off the rails. This document is useful less as a strategy blueprint and more as an example of a delusional — and condescending — mindset that has unfortunately taken hold among a subset of professional progressives.</p><h3>Let’s Get Inclusive and Populist</h3><p>According to Way to Win, there’s no need for Democrats to moderate on any hot-button issue, and in fact doing so could only help Trump. There’s a better way: “inclusive populism,” a messaging strategy that focuses on the <em>true</em> causes of voters’ ills — parasitic rich people and </p>...</source>
