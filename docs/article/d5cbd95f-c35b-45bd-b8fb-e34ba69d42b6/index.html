        <p>Rahm Emanuel <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/chinatalk/p/rahm-on-china-colorful-diplomacy?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">returns</a> to ChinaTalk with a characteristically blunt assessment of U.S.-China relations and verdict on year one of Trump 2.0.</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The “Fear Factor” in Asia:</strong> Why Japan and South Korea are ramping up defense spending not because of Trump’s strength, but because his unpredictability and isolationism have forced them to buy “insurance policies” against a U.S. exit,</p></li><li><p><strong>Corruption and “Own Goals”:</strong> How “draining the swamp” has turned into institutional degradation — and why the Trump family’s entanglement of personal business interests with foreign policy damages U.S. credibility and strategic leverage,</p></li><li><p><strong>Adversary, Not Competitor:</strong> Why the U.S. needs to stop viewing China as a strategic competitor and start treating it as a strategic adversary — one whose win-lose economic model is designed to hollow out global industrial bases,</p></li><li><p><strong>Education as National Security:</strong> Why tariffs are a distraction and the only real way to beat China is a massive domestic push for workforce training,</p></li><li><p><strong>AI and Inequality:</strong> Rahm’s evolving thinking on artificial intelligence — why he’s still learning and why a technology that boosts productivity but widens inequality is a political and social risk.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Plus:</strong>  why Ari Emanuel’s UFC US-China robot rumble is sound policy, Rahm’s case that he’s now the real free-market capitalist in the room, and rapid-fire takes on J.D. Vance, Marco Rubio, and the 2028 Republican field.</p><p>Have a listen in <a href="https://pod.link/1289062927/episode/NGJhYmUzZDYtZGJiNy0xMWYwLWI3YjYtZGY2NTVjN2FhYjk1">your favorite podcast app</a>.</p><h1>On Playing Into China’s Hands</h1><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> Rahm Emanuel, welcome back to ChinaTalk. What a year for US-Asia policy it has been.</p><p><strong>Rahm Emanuel:</strong> That is the understatement of the year.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> <a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/rahm-on-china-colorful-diplomacy">In our 2024 show</a> we started out with me asking you questions about, “Oh, look at all this nice stuff you guys did. Rebuilding alliances. Japan and South Korea are friends again.” And now we’ve got all this.</p><p><strong>Rahm Emanuel: </strong>How did we go downhill so quickly? Is that what you’re asking?</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider</strong>: We now have a year-long sample size of “Trump II” taking a very different take from both Biden and Trump I. Really, it’s a departure from the past 70-plus years of US foreign policy when it comes to relations with our treaty allies. What has it been like watching this, Rahm?</p><p><strong>Rahm Emanuel:</strong> It’s depressing. It’s infuriating. There are a lot of other emotions. Look, it starts from a premise. China’s view is that they are the rising power. America is receding. ...</p>
