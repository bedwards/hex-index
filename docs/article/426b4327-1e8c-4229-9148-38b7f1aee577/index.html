        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how Iraq&#039;s strong Ba&#039;athist state was dismantled after US intervention. De-Ba&#039;athification was the controversial policy that removed regime supporters from power, creating the exact problem Fukuyama warns about in Venezuela—what to do with generals and officials who have no future in a new regime.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Fukuyama references the Maduro regime&#039;s &#039;militias&#039; organized from poor neighborhoods. These are the colectivos—armed civilian groups that form a crucial pillar of regime power. Understanding their structure and role illuminates why regime change in Venezuela faces unique challenges beyond the formal military.</p>
