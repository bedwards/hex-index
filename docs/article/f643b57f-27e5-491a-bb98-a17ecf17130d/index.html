        <p><em>This post is adapted from last week’s Frankly video titled “<a href="https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/frankly-original/111-the-three-most-important-words">The Three Most Important Words We’re Taught Not to Say</a>.” In the future, we’ll be adapting more Frankly videos to written versions and continuing to post them on Substack, so stay tuned for more.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>As a podcast host, there’s one answer that I love to hear when I ask my guests a question – but I rarely ever do:</p><p><em><strong>I don’t know.</strong></em></p><p>To me, this answer is a signal of maturity, nuance, and honesty. It’s not trying to give an answer to all the world’s problems.</p><p>So, why is hearing “I don’t know” so rare?</p><p>We are all members of a social species embedded in a modern culture that’s been turbocharged by energy surplus and social technology. But in this modern setting we still seek status and respect as a product of our evolutionary wiring. Because of this, in most public settings, especially in the media, we overvalue confidence, bravado, and certainty. Today, saying “I don’t know” is seen as a sign of weakness, not of wisdom.</p><p>But in a world increasingly defined by ideological debates, when you hear these words today, they act as a sort of antidote to our cultural consensus trance. Admitting uncertainty makes room for discourse and the possibility of different answers.</p><p>In fact, I’m beginning to think that the reluctance to express “I don’t know” (or its equivalent) out loud is a fatal flaw in our culture as we begin to discuss our vastly complex, risky, and rapidly approaching future – which is chock full of uncertainties.</p><h2>The Right Answer on Wall Street</h2><p>So back in the day, over 30 years ago, I started working at Salomon Brothers, which at the time was one of the coolest places on Wall Street. Their highly respected training program kicked our asses, and one of the key things I remember is that they would ask a series of questions, starting with something simple that you learn in business school like, “What’s the duration of a 30 year note?” Next, they would ask a slightly harder question: “What’s the ticker symbol of Yahoo?” Easy!: YHOO.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg" width="689" height="692" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:692,&quot;width&quot;:689,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wn1d!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d5e9c18-2914-4669-a1d0-99e55ebc0d77_689x692.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Nate in training at Salomon Brothers</figcaption></figure></div><p>And then, after you answered the first two questions, they would ask you a really hard question that you weren’t supposed to be able to answer.
