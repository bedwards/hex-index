        <p>I am writing this post in response to the <a href="https://supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0042">Judgement</a>, For Women Scotland Ltd (Appellant) <em>v </em>The Scottish Ministers (Respondent), published on April 16,<sup> </sup>2025. Five judges from the UK supreme court ruled unanimously that the legal definition of a woman in the Equality Act (2010) did not include transgender women who hold gender recognition certificates (GRCs). In allowing the appeal, the judgement claimed that, at least for the purposes of interpreting the Equality Act, <em>sex</em> refers only to biological sex and that <em>women</em> and <em>men</em> should be treated as distinct groups with a shared biology. I would argue that this claim is not only unjust and ahistorical, based as it is on <em>assertions</em> about common use rather than examples of common use, but also profoundly anti-feminist. As <a href="https://www.wearequeeraf.com/uk-supreme-court-rules-that-trans-women-arent-women-under-the-equality-act-2010/">Jess O’Thomson</a> has argued, “We’re yet to see how all of this will play out in practice, but it seems clear that this won’t just hurt the trans community. The reasoning adopted, and the relentless desire to police ‘what is a woman’ can only hurt our wider communities.”</p><p><em>It is only because “gender critical feminists” have so dominated the British media that this judgement could be referred to as a “<a href="https://feministkilljoys.substack.com/publish/post/161608720#:~:text=Double%20click%20to%20interact%20with%20video">victory for women’s rights.</a>”</em></p><p><strong>I call the judgement a patriarchal hammer. </strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg" width="1456" height="1263" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1263,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1647957,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://feministkilljoys.substack.com/i/161608720?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4KE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4e46898-e4d4-4565-a1ad-c5460875f89e_5218x4526.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>I have written this post as someone without legal expertise (as anyone with such expertise will no doubt be able to tell!).

This small group of so-called “gender critical” feminists have been able to influence policy (and public debate) in the UK in a way that has been disastrous not only for LGBTQIA+ communities but for feminism.</p><p>Yes, defining <em>women</em> as a biological group is a disaster for feminism. </p><p>The many feminists who have argued <em>against</em> the biologisation of <em>sex</em> have been so routinely ignored that if you picked up a mainstream paper in the </p>...</source>
