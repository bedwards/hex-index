      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>The radical pro-life position — “Abortion is as immoral as murdering a baby” — is easily refuted with a simple thought experiment. Namely: If you could either save one human baby from a fire, or a dozen human embryos, what are you morally obliged to do? Almost no one even <em>claims </em>they should choose the embryos over the baby — and virtually no one would in fact do so. </p><p>Why not? Because almost everyone recognizes that an embryo has far less moral worth than an actually-existing baby.</p><p>Yet on reflection, the radical pro-choice position — “Abortion is morally neutral” — is also easily refuted with a parallel thought experiment. Namely: If you could either save one human embryo from a fire, or just let it burn, what are you morally obliged to do? Again, only a small minority even <em>claims </em>they would shrug and walk away. Why not? Because a large majority recognizes that a fertilized egg has <em>intermediate </em>moral value. Abortion is not murder, but neither is it the same as removing a wart.</p><p>Another way to grasp the same point: The death of a child is objectively much worse than a miscarriage. But telling a couple that has experienced a miscarriage, “Sure, this is sad for <em>you</em>. But your embryo wasn’t sufficiently developed to have any <em>independent </em>moral value” isn’t merely rude. It is absurd. When a miscarriage occurs, a reasonable person recognizes the tragedy — not just for the parents, but for the fetus who will never be born.</p><p>My friend Richard Hanania is <a href="https://x.com/RichardHanania/status/1722383111529619818">deeply dismissive of the pro-life position</a>: “Somehow pro-lifers have convinced themselves there’s a non-religious basis to their beliefs.” But the aforementioned moral intuitions about the <em>intermediate </em>moral value of an embryo are hardly sectarian. I’m an atheist of the highest order, and the aforementioned moral intuitions make perfect sense to me.</p><p>What are the implications? To start, abortion is definitely morally justified in extreme scenarios. If a woman will die unless she gets an abortion, she should get an abortion, because the embryo matters far less than her actual human life. The same holds if a pregnant woman is so poor that one of her existing children will starve to death if she doesn’t get an abortion. </p><p>The same plausibly holds if having her baby would cause zero fatalities, but truly <em>ruin </em>the life of the pregnant woman. Preventing the lifelong ...</p>
