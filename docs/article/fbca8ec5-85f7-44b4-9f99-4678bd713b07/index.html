I’m referring to a place where all the reasons behind the different choices that you make, all the lessons you need to learn, all those different experiences have accrued their true value and meaning. I want to be at that point where I’ve earned the sense of clarity of who I’m meant to be and what all this fluff and noise means to my life - whether it means anything at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I know that what I’m asking for is basically a sneak peek at the final page of a book. A book I’m hoping contains personal fulfilment, finding my purpose and a lasting love.I know it’s in part due to an unnerved feeling that I need to have some semblance of reassurance — there’s some happy ending coming my way.

The outcome itself usually arrives quietly, just slipping past you unnoticed. Or, if it has a more definitive entrance it is definitely then anticlimactic but through our ‘esthetic flirtation with the result’, the ‘distress’ or ‘drama’ we wanted to avoid has paradoxically occurred. We damage ourselves worrying about what the answer might be, the infinite outcomes influenced by an infinite number of factors.&nbsp;</p><p>In some ways, our trajectory is set and what we can control is mostly how we influence the quality of the outcome through the effort we put into our actions. So all the worry and anxiety only does one thing&nbsp; — diminish your ability to be thoughtful, intentional, focused and driven. Without </p>...</source>
