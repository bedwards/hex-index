In almost a year of searching for the next thing, I have shed many tears and experienced days of hopelessness. </p><p>Describing job searching as a roller coaster is <em>so</em> accurate because every time you interview, you start inching up and up, your hope increases with each round, and when the rejection letter comes, it’s a plummet back into disappointment and despair. </p><p>What made this search even more difficult was that I didn't know what I wanted to do. I realize no career path is linear, but ever since I started working, I haven’t stayed in one lane. From tax advisory to starting a fam box to sustainability consulting to mushroom meat sales, my jobs have been a little all over the place.</p><p>If you’ve ever worked for yourself, I call it the curse of entrepreneurship. Even though stability and benefits are wildly appealing, I have struggled to find the right fit ever since starting my own business. </p><p>I knew I wanted to go freelance this whole time, but I felt it was impossible because of health insurance. I told myself that if I could get a part-time anchor gig that could provide the stability I needed, I would go freelance, and that’s exactly what happened. </p><p>I am now a Producer for the <a href="https://www.ceresfilmfest.org/">Ceres Food Film Fest</a>, a festival based in NYC that uses film to explore the complex role food plays in our lives and our impact on the broader food system. This is a dream job. </p><p>So, to anyone out there looking for a job or thinking about what to do next, here is what worked for me: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Join things: </strong>Last year, I joined a group called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.peoplein.food/">People in Food</a>&nbsp;with Jo Gryfe, who ultimately introduced me to the film festival's founder. I am also in many Slack channels and <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rachel Karten&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:8247620,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30fa2bd5-b556-4e66-b6f0-26c1004aedb0_746x686.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;4215668c-479e-4378-883c-1df1afeda66f&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>’s Link in Bio Discord channel, all of which provide support and resources.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use LinkedIn: </strong>My friends laugh at me, but this platform can be fun. Post things you are reading and comment on people’s posts, engage with your peers authentically, and find your place in your industry. When I made my creative portfolio,  I shared it on LinkedIn and let my network know about my new skill set.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do it for low cost and try on the title: </strong>I started working with Farm to People on the Know Your Food event </p></li>...</ul>
