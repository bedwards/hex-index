      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I did competitive debate all throughout high school.  But now, I am regarded in debate as a uniquely sinister figure—my friends who remain in the activity tell me that I’m seen as a mix of Hitler, Ted Bundy, and, I was going to say Mao, but debaters actually tend to like him.  So maybe Mitt Romney.  When a debate tournament happened at my college, and I was casually walking through, a loose friend of mine—in high school at the time—was told to “stay away from that guy,” (me), as if I was planning to take his wallet or detonate a bomb.  </p><p>In fact, purportedly there is only one figure more reviled in high school debate than me.  That guy is Michael Moreno, and he is hated because he recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjvmIFrX1xQ">a video</a> of a coach arguing that space is not real, but is instead a projection of white fantasy.  What a monster!  The coach also claimed, in response to the point that black astronauts can verify that space is real because they’ve been there, that <em>he </em>could verify that space wasn’t real because he hadn’t been there.  He likewise denied the existence of Paris! </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png" width="888" height="499" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/da2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:499,&quot;width&quot;:888,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3fOM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fda2b629c-902f-4119-b1c4-c7cc62e4e6f8_888x499.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The story of how I came to be canceled is very funny and quite insane at every level.  Some background about policy debate—the kind I did—is that it’s a completely insane left-wing echo-chamber.  For debate, it is a century of 2020.  Some common features of debate: </p><ul><li><p>Instead of arguing for the topic, debaters say that it’s problematic to expect them to argue for the topic, and instead perform some unrelated speech act, like reading a poem about being Latina.  This is the strategy of about a third of teams. </p></li><li><p>One of the most common responses to the above is claiming that it somehow undermines anti-capitalist revolutions.  </p></li><li><p>Debaters often argue that the way black people are treated in America is indistinguishable from slavery, and if anything, perhaps somewhat worse.  </p></li><li><p>They also argue we should give back <em>all the land in America</em> to indigenous people. They then claim that it’s problematic to ask where the 350 million people currently living in America would go.  </p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVEkHJLOFjk&amp;t=1669s">second most competitive national tournament</a> was won in 2025 by a team claiming that pretending to be magic mermaids is a good strategy for black liberation.  Their last speech began “hoodoo voodoo power, the power by which my magic come, has made this living </p></li></ul>...</source>
