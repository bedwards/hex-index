        <p>Welcome to the FictionMatters Podcast; this is Books That Matter. In this series, I’ll speak with writers I admire to learn about their lives as readers and deep dive into the books that matters to them.</p><p>Today, I’m joined by Rickey Fayne. Rickey’s debut novel <em>The Devil Three Times</em> is currently shortlisted for the <a href="https://centerforfiction.org/grants-awards/the-first-novel-prize/">Center for Fiction’s First Novel Prize</a> and one of my personal favorite debut novels of the year. In this episode, Rickey and I talk about the value of reading classic literature, the books he returned to when he started thinking he wanted to write, and why <em>Song of Solomon</em> by Toni Morrison is the book that matters to him. Then we get into his novel <em>The Devil Three Times</em>. Rickey shares where he began with his expansive project, why he isn’t a short story writer, and how a planned dissertation influenced the novel he eventually wrote.</p><p>You can listen to today’s episode without having read either book. There is one moment where Rickey worries he’s giving away the end of Song of Solomon, but I promise it’s too vague to be a real spoiler! This episode is overflowing with books so be sure to check out the book list and links in the show notes and then pick up your copy of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780316575171">The Devil Three Times</a></em> at your favorite bookshop. </p><p><strong>Books Mentioned</strong></p><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9781668050460">Loca</a></em> by Alejandro Heredia</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780802158741">Small Things Like These</a></em> by Claire Keegan</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780802164209">Wild Houses</a></em> by Colin Barrett</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780061120060">Their Eyes Were Watching God</a></em> by Zora Neale Hurston</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780140187298">House of Mirth</a></em> by Edith Wharton</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780140189704">Age of Innocence</a></em> by Edith Wharton</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780143137214">Custom of the Country</a></em> by Edith Wharton</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780241630815">Summer</a></em> by Edith Wharton</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780142437803">Ethan Frome</a></em> by Edith Wharton</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780804170123">Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</a></em> by Haruki Marukami</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780374530631">Wise Blood</a></em> by Flannery O’Connor</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780358139560">A Good Man is Hard to Find</a></em> by Flannery O’Connor</p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/1173/9780060557577">All of Hagar’s Children</a></em> by Edward P.
