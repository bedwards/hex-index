        <h6>A pushback from two-and-a-half years ago about one of the weirdest emanations of neofascism I have seen in this past truly weird decade: no, Aleksander III Argeados of Makedon was not “Great” in any senes carrying strong connotations of being in some way worthy of admiration; superbly skilled at the deeply unfortunate and disturbing human social practice of war yes, with very large amounts of the virtues useful in that social practice, yes; but a murderous psychopath too, as a very large part of the package… </h6><p>Why am I cross-posting this today? Because I was whipsawed by first seeing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: &lt;<a href="https://x.com/g_shullenberger/status/2005644591060656193">https://x.com/g_shullenberger/status/2005644591060656193</a>&gt; &lt;<a href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/why-im-leaving-harvard/">https://www.compactmag.com/article/why-im-leaving-harvard/</a>&gt;: ‘Whether through hostility or neglect, Western history is being phased out or allowed to die on the vine at Harvard...</p></blockquote><p>Followed by a, “no, my colleagues are just teaching it differently” backpedal:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: ‘People teaching in Western fields… almost all of these people regard the language of “western civilization” as minimally outmoded and maximally “white supremacist”. I am an outlier because I think that the civilizations of the West should be taught as a tradition, and preferentially at the undergrad level. Most of my colleagues disagree and make some sort of obeisance to global history and assume the equality of all “cultures”…</p></blockquote><p>And then by what I can only read as a frantic attempt at full clawback, as his colleagues are all of a sudden not deluded fools making “obeisance to global history and… the equality of all ‘cultures’”, but are rather truly outstanding learned scholars:</p><blockquote><p><strong>James W. Hankins</strong>: ‘I keep reading people who say that no one is teaching Western civilization any more at Harvard, citing my <em>Compact</em> article. It’s not what I said. Harvard (where I’m still on the faculty till 30 June) has 17 outstanding people teaching in Western fields, ancient, medieval and modern…</p></blockquote><p>So I began chasing links.
