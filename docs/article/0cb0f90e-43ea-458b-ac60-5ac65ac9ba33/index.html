        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the Weathermen radical group and a film reimagining their activities. Understanding the actual Weather Underground organization—their ideology, tactics, bombings, and eventual dissolution—provides essential historical context for the cultural critique Žižek is developing.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s title directly references this Bob Dylan song, and it explains how the Weathermen took their name from its lyrics. The song itself is a significant cultural artifact of 1960s counterculture and protest movements.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article grapples with the ethics and legacy of violent leftist action, comparing sympathetic portrayals of &#039;terrorists who looked like us&#039; versus modern perceptions. This broader historical context illuminates the ideological debates Žižek is engaging with.</p>

While breaking detained immigrants out of a detention center in California, Perfidia humiliates the corrupt commanding officer, Steven J. Lockjaw, who develops a sexual fascination with her. Pat and Perfidia become lovers as the French 75 carry out attacks on politicians’ offices, banks, and the power grid. Steven catches Perfidia planting a bomb, but lets her go after she agrees to have sex with him at a motel. Perfidia gives birth to a baby girl, Charlene, but Pat is unable to persuade her to settle down and live as a family. She abandons them to continue her revolutionary activities. After Perfidia is captured at a botched bank robbery, Steven arranges for her to avoid prison in exchange for information about the French 75. She enters witness protection as Steven hunts down her comrades and shoots many of them on sight, forcing the others to go on the run. As Pat and Charlene are forced to live in hiding as Bob and Willa Ferguson, Perfidia escapes Steven’s custody and flees to Mexico.</p><p>Sixteen years later, living in the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, Bob has become a paranoid drug addict who’s living off the grid. He is protective of Willa, who has grown into a self-reliant and spirited teenager. Through his vehement anti-immigration efforts, Steven has become a Colonel and a prominent figure in the US security agencies. He is </p>...</source>
