          <strong>Mixture of experts</strong>
          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses scaling large MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models and Kimi Linear&#039;s hybrid architecture. Understanding the foundational concept of mixture of experts - how multiple specialized neural networks are combined with a gating mechanism - provides essential context for grasping why this architectural approach enables efficient scaling and why expert parallelism matters.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The Kimi Linear paper describes using &#039;finite-state RNN memory&#039; and the classical delta rule in its attention architecture. Readers would benefit from understanding RNN fundamentals to appreciate how linear attention mechanisms draw from and improve upon recurrent approaches while maintaining computational efficiency.</p>

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Emu3.5 being &#039;post-trained with large-scale reinforcement learning&#039; and discusses RL scaling regimes for Kimi Linear. RLHF is the dominant technique for aligning language models, and understanding this specific methodology provides crucial context for how modern models are trained beyond initial pretraining.</p>
