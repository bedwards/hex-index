        <p>From the Pastor:</p><p><strong>Psalm 23:5-6</strong></p><p>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;</p><p>You anoint my head with oil;</p><p>My cup runs over.</p><p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me</p><p>All the days of my life;</p><p>And I will dwell in the house of the LORD</p><p>Forever.</p><p>So far in this Psalm David has taken us from green pastures with still waters to deep, dark, and deadly valleys to now a banquet table overflowing with goodness and mercy from the Lord.

Whether it was the encounter with the giant of the Philistines or one of the many others, but undoubtedly, he has come through and is enjoying a celebration even in the presence of those who had doubted, despised, and rejected David.
