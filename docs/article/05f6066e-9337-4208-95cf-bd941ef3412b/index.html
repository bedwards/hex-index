        <p><em>Hi, this is Gergely with a bonus, free issue of the Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter. In every issue, I cover Big Tech and startups through the lens of senior engineers and engineering leaders. If you’ve been forwarded this email, you can <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/about?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com">subscribe here</a>.</em></p><p>Begin researching developer productivity, and you’re likely to soon encounter the work of Nicole Forsgren, as lead author of the best-selling book <em><a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/">Accelerate</a></em>, and creator of the widely-adopted <a href="https://dora.dev/">DORA</a> and <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124">SPACE</a> developer productivity frameworks. And, beyond SPACE is the <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/developer-productivity-a-new-framework">DevEx framework</a> for productivity measurement, created by Abi Noda in collaboration with Nicole.</p><p>When I heard that the pair’s work together has continued in a new book about developer experience, I wanted to know more, and had the chance to sit down for a conversation about this big project of theirs.</p><p><em><a href="https://developerexperiencebook.com/">Frictionless</a></em> was released two weeks ago, and Nicole and Noda have been nice enough to share an excerpt from their new title with readers of the Pragmatic Engineer, below.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NYjO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F833e5a4f-29ac-4c27-8a3a-e4a82bdf03ea_1600x1200.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><em>My copy of <a href="https://developerexperiencebook.com/">Frictionless</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The back cover of <em>Frictionless</em> reads:</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>AI can generate code in minutes — so why does shipping software still take forever?</strong></p><p>The answer is friction: the invisible barriers that turn quick wins into endless delays. While your competitors ship daily updates, your developers burn out fighting broken tools instead of solving real problems”.</p></blockquote><p>Personally, the lack of impact by AI coding tools to date upon the speed of development and quality of software, is amusing to me. If I take the apps I use, websites I visit, and services I access via software, I don’t see signs of faster iteration, higher quality, and fewer bugs since AI started shaking up the tech industry. An exception might<em> </em>be AI labs that release new features at eye-catching speed, often faster than much nimbler startups, but it could be argued those begin as experimental features.</p><p>What I like about <em>Frictionless</em> is that it gives a step-by-step approach for <em>developers </em>to smooth their own workflows and be more productive. If it helps teams and companies to move faster and produce more and better software – this is a win for everyone!</p><p>This article begins with our conversation, followed by two excerpts from the new book.
