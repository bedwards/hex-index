        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly compares the current AI boom to the &#039;pre-millennium Dotcom Boom&#039; and questions whether AI is a wave, bubble, or both. Understanding the mechanics of the dot-com bubble—the speculative frenzy, rapid growth, and eventual crash—provides essential historical context for evaluating whether current AI investment patterns mirror that era.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s central thesis is about why geographic concentration matters for tech innovation—SF startups getting more traction, easier networking, talent density, and knowledge spillovers. Agglomeration economies is the economic concept that explains exactly why clustering provides these advantages, giving readers the theoretical framework behind the &#039;location, location, location&#039; phenomenon described.</p>

        <p>Starting in 2020, the pandemic emptied offices and changed the ways tech companies operate, and how us techies work and collaborate, by making remote and hybrid work patterns the norm. San Francisco (SF) on the US West Coast became emblematic of a major shift: we saw <a href="https://sfciti.org/news/press-release/new-data-on-the-san-francisco-tech-exodus/">an exodus</a> of tech companies from the city as Pinterest, Stripe, PayPal, and others <a href="https://therealdeal.com/san-francisco/2022/12/12/pinterest-to-bail-out-of-sf-offices-in-soma/">downsized</a>, Tesla and Oracle <a href="https://buildremote.co/companies/businesses-leaving-san-francisco/">moved</a> to Texas, and many VCs, founders, and startups <a href="https://x.com/rabois/status/1387807609470820357">quit</a> for other locations, or simply went fully remote.</p><p>But today, things are changing again. I’ve just returned from San Francisco, where I visited the headquarters of several leading AI companies and up-and-coming startups. Based on my conversations and observations, SF is most definitely back – and it’s more important than ever.</p><p>A new wave of AI startups has been the catalyst to make SF into a buzzing tech hub once more: there are ever more startups launching in the city, the AI meetup scene is energetic, and it’s easy for people to collaborate with one another in person. The tech hub model is proving its value all over again in SF, and might even be one reason for the incredible growth and adoption of AI products and services. <em>Of course, Silicon Valley has no shortage of innovation, VC funding – and a substantial Big Tech presence – but SF stands out for the number of high-growth startups headquartered there.</em></p><p>The city looks like a trailblazer for the re-emergence of the tech hub model, reverting back from the remote work surge of 2020-2023. For companies and professionals, this seems relevant – wherever they’re based.</p><p>Today, we cover:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cursor: push for release 2.0</strong>. A cozy office and a focus on shipping.</p></li><li><p><strong>AI dev tools startups ahead of the curve.</strong> Wispr Flow wants devs to code more by talking, Continue is the “CI/CD infra for AI agents”, and Factory builds AI agents for engineering teams.</p></li><li><p><strong>OpenAI.</strong> Scaling faster than any company ever. 10x infra growth for two years straight, with no signs of that slowing down. Refreshingly, OpenAI also hires junior engineers as well as seniors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anthropic.</strong> Self-organization at scale. Cofounder and former CTO Sam McCandlish shared what helps the company grow, and we discussed their tech stack and engineering challenges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buzzing meetups. </strong>The local chapter of <a href="https://aitinkerers.org/">AI Tinkerers</a> was brimming with “builder energy”, and more than the usual amount of insider knowledge about models, maybe because </p></li>...</ol>
