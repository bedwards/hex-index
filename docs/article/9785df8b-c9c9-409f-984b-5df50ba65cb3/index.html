There was way more to do than there was time, but every morning all 100 engineers would gather in a big conference room, stand in a circle, &amp; report status.</p><p>“What a waste of time!” thought young me, “why are we yapping when we’re so far behind?” Ah, youth.</p><p>Now that launching is cheaper than ever, I’ve been talking to a slew of teams launching new products. I’ve been reminded of that long-ago launch &amp; the wisdom embedded in the practices I participated in without appreciating.</p><p>Pre-launch is its own game of engineering, with its own constraints, its own incentives, &amp; its own tradeoffs. Here’s what I know about the engineering of launching well.</p><h2>Count Down</h2><p>How many calendar days to launch? Everybody should know this number without being told.</p><p>Don’t start the countdown too soon. You aren’t going to be working sustainably pre-launch. Start at 30? Too soon. Start at 5? Too late. You want to capture the pre-launch energy &amp; direct it profitably.</p><h2>You’re Fine</h2><p>If you had to launch with what you have today, you’d be fine. (If you really wouldn’t be fine, then you’re launching too soon.) By the time you start the countdown the product should be usable. Bugs are fine, expected. Some slowness is fine, expected. (Know how you scale though &amp; have a plan to throttle usage.)</p><p>It’s so easy to panic &amp; say, “If we don’t have <em>this</em> ambitious feature, the launch will fail.” Nah. It’s not <em>that</em> important. Know that everyone will be thinking this about everything they do. And they will all be exaggerating. That’s just what a launch countdown does to engineers.</p><h2>Less Upside, More Downside</h2><p>The fundamental change of constraints during launch countdown is that there is way more downside from mistakes than there is upside from new features. You’ll have many new stresses on the system, less time to validate changes, &amp; greater cost from errors than ever before.</p><p>The rest of the advice here supports avoiding costly errors while still getting the most important changes made.</p><h2>You’ll ...</h2>
