        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references Minsky as an example of brilliant scientists in Epstein&#039;s circle. Minsky was a pioneering AI researcher and cognitive scientist whose association with Epstein became controversial. Understanding his scientific contributions and the allegations provides crucial context for the article&#039;s discussion of why intelligent people remained close to Epstein.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Victoria&#039;s Secret and shows a photo from a VS event with Epstein. Wexner, the founder of L Brands (Victoria&#039;s Secret&#039;s parent company), had one of the most significant and mysterious financial relationships with Epstein, giving him power of attorney and transferring his Manhattan mansion to him. This connection is essential context for understanding Epstein&#039;s wealth and influence.</p>
