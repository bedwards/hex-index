        <p>In this week’s Supply Chain in Numbers newsletter, I covered Swisslog’s addition of pallet transport AMR. Here is what I wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>3,000 kg pallet transport AMR</strong></em></p><p>Swisslog, a provider of warehouse automation and software, expanded its portfolio by introducing the IntraMove series of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). IntraMove AMRs provide a versatile, horizontal transportation for payloads up to 3,000 kg (6,613 lb). IntraMove is connected to the AI-based fleet management software via the VDA 5050 standard communication interface. These robots are available in different payload versions — 600 kg, 1,500 kg, and 3,000 kg. It can be directly linked to a WCS or WMS, such as the company’s SynQ software, which manages the transport orders. [<a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/swisslog_introduces_intramove_amr_series_for_dynamic_flexible_horizontal_pallet_transport">Robotics 24x7</a>]</p></blockquote><p>Automating material movement is as old as the concept of the warehouse itself. Let us imagine that you are a Warehouse Manager or someone with ‘warehouse cost’ in your performance measures. I am sure you have explored many automation options within the four walls of your warehouse. [If you haven’t yet, please let me know how you are still employed]</p><p>There are multiple types of pallet movement automation form factors (forktrucks: horizontal &amp; vertical, Mouse: horizontal, and Tugger: horizontal to pull a load; these form factors have blurred lines). This post is restricted to solutions that primarily involve horizontal transportation. Also, we will confine to ‘four walls of the warehouse’ operations. (e.g., pallets transported within factories are not covered here; Though most concepts will apply)</p><p>Now that we have defined our scope, here are some aspects to consider as you evaluate whether this automation makes sense.</p><p>The first step is to answer “Should I spend more time checking this automation option?”. The answer to your question is YES if at least one of the following statements is true:</p><ol><li><p>75%+ of pallet movement happens between predefined origin-destination paths</p></li><li><p>Pallet movement involves 5+ mostly dedicated people, or forklift driver availability (including chronic absentism) is a significant daily problem, reducing warehouse throughput by 10%+</p></li><li><p>Pallets move long distances and contain materials to which you want to minimize any human contact; this might be for safety (e.g, DG / Hazmat), or for better working conditions (e.g., constant movement between refrigerated and ambient sections)</p></li></ol><p>Let us assume the answer is yes, and you want to know more details. Here are some key considerations for each area within the warehouse where pallet movement occurs.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Inbound to Storage</strong>: </p></li>...</ol>
