Something in my heart feels wrong, like everything else around me. I wrap my head in three blankets, making sure my ears are covered, but before I can even hear myself breathe, the epic morning noise begins. From beyond the blankets: the sound of my younger siblings quarrelling over half a piece of pita bread.</p><p>My mother begins to rebuke them, “You want to embarrass us in the eyes of the neighbours? Everyone’s flour is running out; you’re the only ones shouting about it.”</p><p>My head is filled with the desire to leave: to escape this cosmic hell by any means necessary, even if leaving means death. My body is tied down, my joints knotted by fear. I remember my grandmother, who used to relieve my fear after every Israeli aggression with a little olive oil and many prayers. Today, my joints are bound tighter than ever, and my grandmother is not here to comfort me.</p><p>The funniest thing of all, and I don’t know if it’s really funny, is that the fear I’m experiencing isn’t a fear of death or annihilation, but rather a fear of life. It’s a fear of the phonetics exam I’m taking in the coming days, of my haphazard Italian learning, of my inability to complete anything, of missing opportunities, of falling behind my classmates at university, of the possibility of gaining or losing weight.</p><p>Death has never frightened me; it has only restricted me, casting black, petrified sadness on my heart. But this morning, my fear of life grows and grows, and, with it, a great anger at my inability to overcome fear. I cry under the covers and wish for the return of my grandmother with her tin of olive oil.</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>You can’t share stories from </strong><em><strong>thewalrus.ca</strong></em><strong> on Facebook or Instagram because of Meta’s response to the <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/why-you-might-stop-seeing-canadian-news/">Online News Act</a>, but you can share this Substack article there</strong></h4><div><hr></div><p>We are displaced: my mother, myself, and my four younger siblings (Hadi, Taqwa, Raghad, and Maryam), living in a tent in Deir al-Balah, in the centre of the Gaza Strip.
