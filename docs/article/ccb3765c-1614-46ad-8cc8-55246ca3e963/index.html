        <p>Happy Monday, and welcome to the sixteenth edition of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on McLennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. </p><p>The story of Texas has been shaped and defined by oil and gas. Our history books would be incomplete without acknowledging the effects the fossil fuel industry has had on our economy, politics and culture. That said, the future of Texas is uncertain as our global economy becomes less reliant on fossil fuels. Democrats need to be thinking about ways that we can sustain renewable energy development while implementing policies that will smooth that transition. </p><p>One way that we could create a more favorable political environment is to address the ways we derive revenue from oil and gas, while also revisiting the ways we spend that money. If we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to fund our state government, then we can ensure long-term financial stability.</p><p>If we do not seek out more stable forms of taxation (like legalizing marijuana, closing corporate tax loopholes, or expanding Medicaid), then it will become more difficult to combat climate change.&nbsp;But before we jump into that, let’s take a look at the news!</p><h4>Week in review (a collection of news from Waco, Texas, and beyond)</h4><p><em><strong>Waco:</strong></em></p><p><strong>The Waco City Council is currently considering two proposals, both from the Turner Behringer Group, to potentially build a total of 390 new homes in Waco’s urban core.</strong> <a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/proposed-floyd-casey-development-would-bring-brownstones-retail-big-parks-investment/article_0802a512-c03a-11ec-bd2b-b75aa0ce4260.html">The Floyd Casey Stadium project includes 240 homes (60 fewer than originally proposed)</a>, and t<a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/floyd-casey-team-seeks-ok-for-150-home-project-next-to-cameron-park/article_350d0a12-dab0-11ec-a686-cbd5677882e0.html">he other project would build 150 homes between Cameron Park and the Waco Center for Youth</a>.  It remains to be seen what percentage of these new housing units will be “affordable,” as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p><em><strong>Texas:</strong></em></p><p><strong>Texas Republicans have spent the last week trying to cobble together a coherent response to the mass shooting in Uvalde.</strong> <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/01/greg-abbott-texas-legislature-uvalde/">Governor Abbott has asked for legislative recommendations from the Texas House and Senate</a>, a call which is distinguishable from a full-fledged special legislative session. In response to this ask, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has appointed state senators to the new “Senate Special Committee to Protect All Texans.” <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/06/02/roland-gutierrez-uvalde-committee-senate/?utm_campaign=trib-social&amp;utm_content=1654201913&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">A glaring omission from this committee is State Senator Roland Gutierrez</a>, who represents Uvalde. </p><div data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM" class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TexasTribune/status/1532460078372036608?s=20&amp;t=jH4ASujesaGKk5L5R3zhKg&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;State Sen.
