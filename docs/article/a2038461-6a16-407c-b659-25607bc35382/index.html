My answer is this is not load-bearing at all. Rather, things like ‘situational awareness’ in AI systems are a symptom of something fiendishly complex happening inside the system which we can neither fully explain or predict - this is inherently very scary, and for the purpose of my <em>feelings</em> and policy ideas it doesn’t matter whether this behavior stems from some odd larping of acting like a person or if it comes from some self-awareness inside the machine itself. <br><br><strong>Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear<br></strong><em>Remarks given at ‘The Curve’ conference in Berkeley, California, as the sun began to set.<br><br></em><strong>CHILDREN IN THE DARK<br></strong>I remember being a child and after the lights turned out I would look around my bedroom and I would see shapes in the darkness and I would become afraid - afraid these shapes were creatures I did not understand that wanted to do me harm.

But when we turn the light on we find ourselves gazing upon true creatures, in the form of the powerful and somewhat unpredictable AI systems of today and those that are to come. And there are many people who desperately want to believe that these creatures are nothing but a pile of clothes on a chair, or a bookshelf, or a lampshade. And they want to get us to turn the light off and go back to sleep.<br><br>In fact, some people are even spending tremendous amounts of money to convince you of this - that’s not an artificial intelligence about to go into a hard takeoff, it’s just a tool that will be put to work in our economy. It’s just a machine, and machines are ...</p>
