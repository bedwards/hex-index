        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Doris Santoro&#039;s concept of &#039;demoralization&#039; where teachers are forced to act against their values. Moral injury - originally studied in military contexts - describes the psychological damage from being forced to violate one&#039;s moral code, directly paralleling the author&#039;s discussion of teachers&#039; eroded &#039;moral centers&#039;.</p>
