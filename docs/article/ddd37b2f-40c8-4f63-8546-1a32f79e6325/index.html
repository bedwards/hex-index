        <p>The Justice Department remains wildly out of compliance with the Jeffrey Epstein transparency law Congress passed last year—but don’t expect the House Republicans who voted for the bill to make too much of a stink about it. “I don’t give a rip about Epstein,” Rep.

Indeed, this administration’s only notice of the day seems to have come in late November of last year, when it <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-admin-removes-mlk-day-juneteenth-from-national-parks-fee-free-days-11160677">announced</a> that it had eliminated this holiday from the list of days with free entry to America’s national parks.</p><p>So if you go to a national park today, you’ll have to pay. But not if you go on June 14th, 2026. For Donald Trump’s Interior Department has <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-announces-modernized-more-affordable-national-park-access">announced</a> that the schedule of “resident-only patriotic fee-free” days will include for the first time that date billed as “Flag Day/President Trump’s birthday.”</p><p>So petty. So pathetic.</p><p>Still, Martin Luther King Jr. Day remains a federal holiday. There is no federal holiday honoring the current occupant of the Oval Office. I trust there never will be. And it is heartening that the United States is still a country that, by law and consensus, honors King and not Trump.</p><p>If you want to reflect on real American patriotism and greatness, you might take a few moments today to read about the life and achievements of King and the civil rights movement he led. You might particularly find it worthwhile to read some of King’s own writings, and to listen to or watch some of his own words.</p><p>You might focus on the year 1963. In April of that year, he wrote his great “<a href="https://www.whatsoproudlywehail.org/curriculum/the-american-calendar/letter-from-birmingham-jail">Letter from a </a></p>...</source>
