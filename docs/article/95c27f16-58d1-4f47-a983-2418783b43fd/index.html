        <p class="topic-summary">Directly relevant to Vienna&#039;s people-first mobility transformation and the X-minute city concept discussed. Superblocks are a specific urban planning model that prioritizes pedestrians over cars, turning streets into community spaces—exactly what Vienna is doing with former parking lots.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Safe Street Rebel&#039;s protests against autonomous vehicles in San Francisco by placing cones on them. Understanding Waymo&#039;s technology, deployment, and the controversies around autonomous vehicles provides essential context for why activists are targeting these vehicles and the broader debate about corporate technology in public spaces.</p>

The program led to 1.8 million fewer miles driven and a drop in emissions equivalent to taking 5,200 cars off the road.</p></li><li><p>Here’s an analysis of how the activist group Safe Street Rebel used <a href="https://www.mediapolisjournal.com/2025/11/playful-resistance/">traffic cones to immobilize autonomous vehicles</a> in San Francisco. The piece frames the protest as “playful resistance,” a form of tactical urbanism that challenges the corporate takeover of public space and exposes the vulnerabilities of sensor-based tech.</p></li></ul><p>Videos, podcasts, books, and socials:</p><ul><li><p>We’re very happy to announce that <a href="https://thelabofthought.co/shop/p/nbmi3">Non-Boring Mobility Innovations 2025</a>, which we both edited, is now widely available.
