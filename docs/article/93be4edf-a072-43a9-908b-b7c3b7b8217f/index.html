        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Gagauzia multiple times - an MP from there, the People&#039;s Assembly chairman resigning, and Bashkan Gutsul&#039;s situation. Most readers outside the region know little about this autonomous territorial unit within Moldova, its Turkic-speaking Orthodox Christian population, its unique political status, and its complex relationship with Chisinau.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Moldova denouncing CIS agreements and visa-free travel arrangements. Understanding the CIS - its formation after Soviet collapse, its member states, its actual versus nominal functions, and why post-Soviet states are gradually distancing from it - provides crucial context for Moldova&#039;s geopolitical realignment toward the EU.</p>

        <h2>The Parliamentary Roster is Now Final</h2><p>Following the election and convening of a new parliament, MPs have a set period of time (around 30 days) to resolve any “incompatibilities” with their new role. According to the constitution and relevant laws, the role of a Member of Parliament (MP) is incompatible with virtually all paid work except for part time roles as teachers or academics. This means that for the most part, MPs must give up their other jobs when they are elected. If they are business owners, they may retain ownership but are barred from public procurements and they must step away from active management. </p><p>This week <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/vosem-deputatov-v-tom-chisle-ion-cheban-podali-v-otstavku-kto-zaimet-ih-mesta">8 MPs resigned their seats</a> in parliament - with most stating that they preferred to keep their old jobs. Of these 8, 5 are from PAS, 2 are from “Our Party” and 1, Ion Ceban, is from Alternative. Mayor Ceban resigned in order to continue his role as Chisinau’s mayor. All MPs that resigned will be replaced with new candidates from their party’s list. </p><p>The 5 PAS MPs who left parliament are: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Maria Acbaș</strong> - <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/video-mariya-akbash-obyasnila-pochemu-otkazyvaetsya-ot-mesta-v-parlamente-ya-delayu-vybor-v-polzu-biznesa">Chose to remain</a> the director of her agriculture business in Gagauzia. </p></li><li><p><strong>Constantin Cheianu</strong> - <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/ya-pereoczenil-svoi-vozmojnosti-i-fizicheskoe-sostoyanie-konstantin-keyanu-uhodit-iz-parlamenta-po-sostoyaniyu-zdorovya">Cited health reasons</a> and stated that he “<em>overestimated his capabilities and physical condition.</em>” </p></li><li><p><strong>Viorel Bostan</strong> - <a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/politic/motivele-pentru-care-viorel-bostan-roman-cojuhari-si-nicolae-draganel-renunta-la-mandatele-de-deputati/">will remain</a> rector of the Technical University.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roman Cojuhari</strong> - <a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/politic/motivele-pentru-care-viorel-bostan-roman-cojuhari-si-nicolae-draganel-renunta-la-mandatele-de-deputati/">will remain</a> Director of the Public Property Agency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nicolae Drăgănel</strong> - <a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/politic/motivele-pentru-care-viorel-bostan-roman-cojuhari-si-nicolae-draganel-renunta-la-mandatele-de-deputati/">will remain</a> president of Călărași district.</p></li></ul><p>With these resignations the new parliament is in its final form. </p><div class="pullquote"><p><strong>Quick Context</strong>: These 5 PAS MPs join 8 others <a href="https://www.moldovamatters.md/i/178179369/other-political-news">who already resigned</a>, 5 of them for positions in government. The large number of people who ran on the PAS lists but seem not to have intended to serve in parliament has provoked a lot of discussion in recent weeks. This included some of the highest profile PAS candidates - including Dorin Recean, Nicu Popescu and Artur Mija. The quick departure of candidates who undoubtedly inspired at least some personal support with voters is being criticized as an electoral strategy rather than a real presentation of a governing team. <br><br>It’s worth noting that this isn’t a new phenomenon, but these numbers are larger than normal. For example, no one really expected Mayor Ceban to leave his post and move to parliament. Should Alternative have become kingmakers and he was in a position to be Prime Minister he </p>...</div>
