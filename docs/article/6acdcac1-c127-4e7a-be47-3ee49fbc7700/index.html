Reding Quiñones — to pursue long-promised charges of a “grand conspiracy” against President Trump’s adversaries….</em></p><p><em>Last week, Mr. Reding Quiñones, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, issued more than two dozen subpoenas, including to officials who took part in the inquiry into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.</em></p><p><em>Among them, they said, were James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; Peter Strzok, a former F.B.I. counterintelligence agent who helped run the Russia investigation; and Lisa Page, a former lawyer at the bureau.</em></p></blockquote><p>—Glenn Thrush, Alan Feuer &amp; Charlie Savage, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/09/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-probe-subpoenas.html">“Trump Loyalists Push ‘Grand Conspiracy’ as New Subpoenas Land,”</a><strong> </strong>the <em>New York Times</em>, 9 November 2025</p><div><hr></div><p>Since the day he learned that the FBI was looking into his campaign’s ties to Russia, Donald Trump has sought to discredit the investigation, impugn the individuals behind it, and insist that the whole thing was not just a “witch hunt,” but “the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!”</p><p>Even now, his allies in Washington, on TV news, and in sensationalized content produced by MAGA influencers (some of whom, per the allegations in the indictment of Tenet Media, <em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/well-known-right-wing-influencers-duped-to-work-for-covert-russian-operation-u-s-prosecutors-say">literally</a></em><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/well-known-right-wing-influencers-duped-to-work-for-covert-russian-operation-u-s-prosecutors-say"> took money from Russia!</a>), refer to the investigation as “the Russia hoax,” in a quixotic effort to deny the Mueller Report, Volume 5 of the Senate Intelligence Committee’s Report on Russian Interference in the 2016 Election, ten years of investigative reporting in media outlets large and small, all available evidence, and Occam’s razor.</p><p>Given the weaponization of the Justice Department, the bogus indictment of James Comey by dime-store Hope Hicks Lindsey Halligan, and the installation of Kash Patel, a leader of the “Grand Conspiracists,” as FBI Director, it is unfortunate but not surprising that this claque of MAGA loyalists has found a prosecutor willing to make a complete ass of himself by signing off on a flurry of subpoenas to key figures in the various investigations into Trump/Russia.</p><p>According to the <em>New York Times</em>, “The investigation in Florida appears to focus, for now, on a January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election, particularly the role played by John O.
