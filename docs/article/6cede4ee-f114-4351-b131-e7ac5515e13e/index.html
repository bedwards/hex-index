        <p class="topic-summary">This is the historical problem that founded graph theory itself.

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions that &#039;modern-day apps are much more sophisticated&#039; than basic BFS/DFS. A* is the specific algorithm that powers most real-world navigation systems, combining Dijkstra&#039;s approach with heuristics—the natural next step for curious readers.</p>

Though the mechanisms used in modern-day apps are much more sophisticated, they stand on the shoulders of these two basic but effective methods.</p><p>In order, this is our agenda for today:</p><ul><li><p><strong>🍞 Breadth-First Search — </strong>a graph traversal that simulates how you would explore a new city.</p></li><li><p>🥖 <strong>Depth-First Search — </strong>a graph traversal that would allow you to escape from any maze.</p></li><li><p>🥞 <strong>Connected Components — </strong>a graph term to call your hometown if you knew how to get to any place from any location.</p></li></ul><p>Given a graph <em>G = (V, E)</em> and two vertices <em>s</em> and <em>t</em>, the goal is to determine whether there exists a path that starts at <em>s</em> and ends at <em>t</em>.
