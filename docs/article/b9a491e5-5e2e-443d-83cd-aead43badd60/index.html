        <p>Let’s talk about Uber’s latest move in Kenya. The company launched <em>Uber Safari</em>, a feature that lets you book a game-drive vehicle in Nairobi National Park straight from the app. Sounds smart, right?</p><p>Except… it hasn’t gone down well.</p><p>Local tour operators say the prices are high and unclear. Some even claim they’re being pushed aside. Regulators don’t seem fully ready either — there’s still no clear policy on how ride-hailing fits into protected wildlife zones.</p><p>What looked like a shortcut to modernize tourism is now a reminder that tech doesn’t always translate across borders. When global platforms enter local industries, the result often depends on how well they understand the ground they’re stepping on.</p><p>Read the full story here: <a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/uber-safaris-high-price-and-low-transparency-raise-questions-in-kenya/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Uber Safari’s High Price and Low Transparency Raise Questions in Kenya</a>.</p><p>Now, let’s switch to Brazil.</p><p>In the latest <em>Emerging Markets Today</em> podcast episode, we look at what it really takes to enter Brazil’s ride-sharing market — one of the most competitive in the world. Between Uber, 99, and strict regulation, new players have to fight for every rider.</p><p>It’s a story of persistence and timing, not hype.</p><p>You can watch the full episode:</p><ul><li><p>On <strong>Spotify (video) and all the other platforms: </strong><a href="https://podfollow.com/emerging-markets-today/view">Click here.</a></p></li><li><p>On <strong>Substack:</strong> <a href="https://emergingmarkets.today/brazil-what-it-takes-to-break-into-the-ride-sharing-market/">Brazil: What It Takes to Break Into the Ride-Sharing Market</a></p></li></ul>
