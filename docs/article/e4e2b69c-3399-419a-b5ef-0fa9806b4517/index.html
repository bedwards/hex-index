While partisans on both sides will tell you this is a clean-cut decision, I think there are actually many very close legal questions, which is fascinating.</p><p>The reality is that we are almost surely going to get a decision that attempts to put down some long-term markers for how the court thinks about these questions, while on the specifics of the tariffs, essentially trying to stall. The court will probably give a bunch of new guidelines and principles and then remand the case back to a lower court to figure out how to implement them. It’s a little bit like what you saw them do with the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">presidential immunity</a> question.</p><p>The result will be that everyone will have a better sense of how the court would initially decide this, but there will be more time before anything is actually resolved. In the interim, the administration will have to figure out what it wants to move on through other authorities, what it wants to keep fighting on, and what, if anything, it wants to legislate. <strong>Anyone who’s looking for a clear-cut and decisive victory or devastating loss will almost surely be disappointed</strong>.</p><p><strong>Peter Harrell:</strong> I might disagree a bit with you, Oren, on that. I heard a majority of the court was skeptical that the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45618">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a> (IEEPA) authorizes at least all of the tariffs that Trump has imposed under IEEPA. While we could see a decision that holds that some IEEPA tariffs are authorized and then kicks the case to lower courts to sort ...</p>
