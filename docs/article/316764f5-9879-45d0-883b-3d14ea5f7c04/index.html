I heard five responses:</p><ol><li><p>It’s not hopeless because the unions support some (blue-tinged) reforms.</p></li><li><p>It’s not hopeless because some elected Democrats are tiring of the union position.</p></li><li><p>It’s not hopeless because a progressive approach to reform can overcome union resistance.</p></li><li><p>It’s not hopeless because regulatory agencies—which are somewhat insulated from politics—can drive reform in blue states.</p></li><li><p>It may or may not be hopeless, but education policy in red states is a mess, too.</p></li></ol><p><strong>1. Unions support some progressive reforms.</strong></p><p>Some folks wrote me privately to argue that the unions are not the boogeyman I make them out to be. The NEA and AFT and their state and local affiliates are on board with school funding reforms, for example, that drive more resources to the neediest schools—as well as efforts to diversify the teaching profession and implement universal pre-K. In all three of these cases, they say, it’s stingy Republicans (and their business backers) or ideological conservatives (with their bugaboos about any race-conscious policies) that are the problem. And they have less power in blue states, so progress is possible there.</p><p><strong>2. Some Democrats are showing more willingness to break with the unions.</strong></p><p><strong>Marguerite Roza</strong> is hopeful that Democratic leaders are starting to show some courage again:</p><blockquote><p>My oversimplified take: In the last few years, blue state leaders and unions </p></blockquote>...</source>
