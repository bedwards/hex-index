        <h3>“Words are events, they do things, change things. They transform both speaker and hearer; they feed energy back and forth and amplify it. They feed understanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it.”</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wave-Mind-Essays-Writer-Imagination/dp/1590300068/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" class="cover" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.themarginalian.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/leguin_waveinthemind.jpg?w=680&amp;ssl=1"></a>Every act of communication is an act of tremendous courage in which we give ourselves over to two parallel possibilities: the possibility of planting into another mind a seed sprouted in ours and watching it blossom into a breathtaking flower of mutual understanding; and the possibility of being wholly misunderstood, reduced to a withering weed. Candor and clarity go a long way in fertilizing the soil, but in the end there is always a degree of unpredictability in the climate of communication — even the warmest intention can be met with frost. Yet something impels us to hold these possibilities in both hands and go on surrendering to the beauty and terror of conversation, that ancient and abiding human gift. And the most magical thing, the most sacred thing, is that whichever the outcome, we end up having transformed one another in this vulnerable-making process of speaking and listening.</p>
<p>Why and how we do that is what <strong>Ursula K. Le Guin</strong> (October 21, 1929–January 22, 2018) explores in a magnificent piece titled <strong>“Telling Is Listening”</strong> found in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wave-Mind-Essays-Writer-Imagination/dp/1590300068/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>The Wave in the Mind: Talks and Essays on the Writer, the Reader, and the Imagination</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/wave-in-the-mind-talks-and-essays-on-the-writer-the-reader-and-the-imagination/oclc/52418183&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>), which also gave us her spectacular meditations on <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/10/17/ursula-k-le-guin-gender/">being a man</a> and <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/10/21/ursula-le-guin-dogs-cats-dancers-beauty/">what beauty really means</a>.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Kurt Vonnegut’s <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/11/26/kurt-vonnegut-on-the-shapes-of-stories/">diagrams of the shapes of stories</a>, Le Guin argues that “our ruling concept of communication is a mechanical model,” which she illustrates thusly:</p>

<p>She explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Box A and box B are connected by a tube. Box A contains a unit of information. Box A is the transmitter, the sender. The tube is how the information is transmitted — it is the medium. And box B is the receiver. They can alternate roles. The sender, box A, codes the information in a way appropriate to the medium, in binary bits, or pixels, or words, or whatever, and transmits it via the medium to the receiver, box B, which receives and decodes it. </p>
<p>A and B can be thought of as machines, such as computers. They can also be thought of as minds. Or one can be a machine and </p>...</blockquote>
