          <strong>Nuremberg trials</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions Americans&#039; pivotal role in the Nuremberg trials as an example of upholding rule of law after WWII atrocities. Understanding the actual legal framework, key figures, and lasting precedents of these trials provides essential context for the author&#039;s argument about American ideals.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author twice invokes &#039;blood and soil nationalism&#039; to characterize both the Trump administration&#039;s rhetoric and Putin&#039;s justification for attacking Ukraine. This Nazi-era ideology&#039;s origins and modern resurgence directly illuminates the article&#039;s central warning about authoritarian nationalism.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">When the author compares tech billionaires using US power against the EU to &#039;the way the United Fruit Company once used the power of the US government to subjugate Central America,&#039; this is the specific historical event being referenced. Understanding this CIA-backed coup provides concrete context for the comparison.</p>

It was the first among equals within an alliance of nations bound together by shared values — above all a commitment to democracy and civil liberties. From London to Berlin to Tokyo, in the aftermath of genocide and the utter devastation of World War II, America – as Ronald Reagan put it – was the shining city on the hill. We should never forget that Americans played the pivotal roles in the Nuremberg trials, upholding the rule of law in an impartial and transparent manner in the trials of those who had committed unspeakable atrocities and acts of war. “Ich bin ein Berliner,” declared John F. Kennedy in Berlin, as East Germany tried to trap its own people behind the Berlin Wall.</p><p>MAGA, however, doesn’t want to be part of that world. In fact, it doesn’t want a world of democracy, civil liberties and the rule of law to exist. The Trump administration has become especially hostile to Europe, precisely because the Europeans are trying to hold on to the values MAGA is trying to destroy at home.</p><p>Last week the Trump administration released its updated <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">National Security Strategy</a> for the United States. Much of the document is vague, meandering and self-contradictory. But it becomes clear and focused when it turns to Europe. Quite simply, Trump and those around him hate Europe. And they hate it because it still honors the ideals they’re abandoning in America.</p><p>The language is astonishing. Europe, the document warns, faces “the stark prospect of civilizational erasure.” Why? Because “it is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain NATO members will become majority non-European.” I don’t know why they bothered with the euphemism: “non-European” clearly means “nonwhite.”</p><p>But there’s hope, the document declares, thanks to “the growing influence of patriotic European parties,” by which it clearly means parties like Germany’s neo-Nazi AfD.</p><p>The political scientist Henry Farrell <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/180813236">sums it up</a> this way:</p><blockquote><p>This is, quite straightforwardly, a program for regime change in Europe, aimed at turning it into an illiberal polity. Accomplishing this transformation would involve undermining existing liberal governments in cahoots with Europe’s own far right, and turning Eastern Europe into an ideological wedge against its Western neighbors.</p></blockquote><p>Where is this attack on Europe coming from?
