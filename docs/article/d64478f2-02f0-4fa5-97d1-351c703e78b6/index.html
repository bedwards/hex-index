        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses how colchicine became a breakthrough treatment for this rare inherited autoinflammatory disease in the 1970s, marking a pivotal moment in the drug&#039;s modern renaissance. Understanding FMF&#039;s genetics, symptoms, and the role of colchicine provides crucial context for the drug&#039;s transformation from ancient gout remedy to precise anti-inflammatory therapy.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article explains that colchicine works by binding to tubulin and preventing microtubule formation, which is the key mechanism behind both its therapeutic effects and its notorious side effects. Understanding microtubules—the cellular scaffolding essential for cell division and immune cell movement—illuminates why colchicine can simultaneously reduce inflammation and cause gastrointestinal problems.</p>

Franklin, tormented by gout and desperate for relief, had heard whispers of this mysterious European remedy. He could not have known that he was importing one of humanity’s oldest medicines, recorded as a poison roughly around 1500 BC, and that it would, more than two centuries after Franklin’s death, prevent heart attacks in American patients.</p><p>Colchicine is extracted from the autumn crocus, a purple flower native to Europe, and its story spans three millennia of medical history. Today, it stands as one of the few substances that can claim both ancient pedigree and modern FDA approval, having navigated the treacherous waters of contemporary pharmaceutical regulation to emerge as a treatment for gout, rare genetic diseases, and cardiovascular conditions.</p><h3>The origin story</h3><p>The earliest surviving reference to colchinine appears in the late fourth century BC, when botanist Theophrastus wrote of a deadly plant called <em><a href="https://www.academia.edu/42898804/From_Poison_to_Drug_New_Recipes_Discovered_Containing_Colchicine_as_a_Remedy_for_Podagra_in_Rome_and_Byzantium#:~:text=Historians%20of,(meadow%20saffron)">ephemeron</a></em>, meaning ‘one-day killer’. By the first century AD, Dioscorides had given it the name that stuck: <em><a href="https://archive.org/stream/Dioscorides_Materia_Medica/Dioscorides%20-%20Materia%20Medica_djvu.txt#:~:text=4%2D84.%20KOLCHIKON,it%20bulbus%20agrestis.">kolchikon</a></em> (‘plant from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colchis">Colchis</a>’) and later called colchicum, warning it ‘kills by choking, similar to mushrooms’. For the next 1,500 years, Western medicine treated colchicum strictly as poison. Medieval herbalists warned against its use; renaissance physician <a href="https://www.exclassics.com/herbal/herbalv1096.htm#:~:text=The%20roots%20of%20all%20the%20sorts%20of%20Meadow%20Saffrons%20are%20very%20hurtful%20to%20the%20stomach%2C%20and%20being%20eaten%20they%20kill%20by%20choking%2C%20as%20Mushrooms%20do%2C%20according%20unto%20Dioscorides%3B%20whereupon%20some%20have%20called%20it%20Colchicum%20strangulatorium.">John Gerard</a> declared its roots ‘very hurtfull to the stomacke’.</p><p>This reputation began to shift in the late eighteenth century, when French army officer Nicolas Husson created a wildly popular secret gout remedy called <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5747853/">Eau Médicinale</a>.
