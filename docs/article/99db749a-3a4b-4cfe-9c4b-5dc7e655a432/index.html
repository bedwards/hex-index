        <p>Hi there!</p><p>I want to try something different for The Palindrome.</p><p>Instead of running a typical “discount for a few days” sale, I’d like to turn the next month into the time where we take The Palindrome to the next level instead. Think of it as a crowdfunding campaign, right here on Substack.</p><p><strong>What could </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong> help build if your subscription is turned into more math &amp; ML for everyone?</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that I want to turn The Palindrome into a full educational platform, focused on the foundations of mathematics and machine learning. I’ve been </p><ul><li><p>talking with a couple of educators about <strong>exclusive mini-courses and video courses</strong> for The Palindrome,</p></li><li><p>thinking a lot about how to bring <em>a lot</em> <strong>more visuals</strong>, more structure, and more depth to what we already do,</p></li><li><p>and even bring <strong>full-time creators</strong> to the team.</p></li></ul><p>Here’s the plan. (And a 30% off forever discount.)</p><div><hr></div><h2>The 2026 Milestone &amp; Rewards Plan</h2><p>Over the next month, every new paid subscription will move us closer to concrete milestones.</p><p>Currently, we stand at 550 paid subscribers. If we reach these milestones by the end of 2025, I’ll reinvest directly into The Palindrome:</p><ul><li><p><strong>600 paid subscribers → Exclusive mini-course (Q2 2026)</strong></p><p>A focused, <strong>paid-members-only mini-course</strong> on a core math/ML topic (think: a deep dive you can follow step-by-step, not just a single article). The topic of the first mini-course will be “Mathematics of Machine Learning”.</p></li><li><p><strong>700 paid subscribers → Another exclusive mini-course (Q4 2026)</strong></p><p>A second mini-course with a different expert/angle. The idea is to slowly build an extensive “course library” for members.</p></li><li><p><strong>800 paid subscribers → Dedicated Manim animator</strong></p><p>We’ll bring on a <strong>Manimator</strong> so more articles come with clean, high-quality animations that make the concepts instantly click.</p></li><li><p><strong>1,000 paid subscribers → Full-time writer</strong></p><p>This is the big one. With a full-time writer on the team, we can ship <strong>more deep dives, more courses, and more structured learning tracks</strong> throughout 2026.</p></li></ul><p>Every one of these rewards benefits <strong>all paid members</strong>.</p><p>If you upgrade now, you’re not just supporting what exists today; you’re helping shape what we can build next year.</p><div><hr></div><h2>What you already get as a paid member</h2><p>On top of these future rewards, paid members already get:</p><ul><li><p>Full access to the <strong>entire archive</strong> of deep dives</p></li><li><p>Weekly <strong>exclusive posts</strong> on math &amp; machine learning</p></li><li><p>Priority for future <strong>cohort-based courses</strong> and experiments</p></li><li><p>Structured <strong>learning tracks</strong> (graph theory, </p></li>...</ul>
