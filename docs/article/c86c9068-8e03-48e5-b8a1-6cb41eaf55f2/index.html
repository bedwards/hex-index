Wiles was rewarded mightily when Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/donald-trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff-00188346">named</a> her his official and powerful gatekeeper as White House Chief of Staff.</p><p>But now, Wiles has swung those gates wide open by giving 11 recorded interviews to Vanity Fair, delivered in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1">Part One</a> and <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-2?srsltid=AfmBOorhTtYY8dVm-kECRPi8ZjbLdYdRasQLGgO9Tzljzv7K3ongVfI3">Part Two</a> punches, with a series of truly jaw-dropping statements and claims.</p><p>The piece, which also presented highly <a href="https://x.com/muellershewrote/status/2001289807540949025?s=61&amp;t=dlYuBcwzZXmET9Xd_RRdaQ">unflattering photos</a> of Trump’s motley set of advisors, provides the first, broad insider’s look at the Trump 2.0 White House. It confirms some things we’ve long suspected about key figures in the President’s orbit; it offers Wiles’s unique perspective on the lies, tensions and missteps that have characterized the regime; and it lays bare both her sycophantic devotion to Trump and her inability to prevent, and later her deep complicity in, some of Trump’s most terrible policies and acts.</p><p>Before we get into those, a bit about how wild it is that this piece even happened at all—and the circling of the wagons it has triggered.</p><p><em><strong>The unguarded guardian</strong></em></p><p>As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/16/us/politics/susie-wiles-takeaways-trump.html">reported</a>,</p><blockquote><p>The nation’s capital was stunned on Tuesday by an explosive new article recounting a year’s worth of unguarded conversations with the usually guarded Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff who spilled on everything from President Trump’s “alcoholic’s personality” to the brewing war in Venezuela.</p></blockquote><p>Wiles typically “shuns publicity” but somehow agreed to 11 interviews this year with Chris Whipple, who previously wrote a book on White House chiefs of staff. Perhaps Wiles saw herself as someone to be counted among these historic figures and decided candor would serve her.</p><p>It did not. After the article published, a clearly upset Wiles <a href="https://x.com/susiewiles/status/2000943061627548148?s=42">blasted it</a> on social media, which she rarely uses, calling it “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.” (Narrator: None of that last part is true.)</p><p>And while not disputing what she actually said on tape to Whipple, or any of the facts set forth in the article, Wiles claimed that “significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story.”</p><p>Hold </p>...</source>
