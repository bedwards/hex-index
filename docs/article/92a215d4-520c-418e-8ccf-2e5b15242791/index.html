Credit: Courtesy photo.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Dozens of protesters from the “One Church One Qurbana” movement, who support a new uniform Eucharistic liturgy, entered St. Mary’s Cathedral Basilica in Ernakulam, southern India, Dec. 10.</p><p>They <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2025/Dec/11/200-strong-pro-uniform-holy-mass-group-occupies-ernakulams-st-marys-cathedral-basilica">reportedly</a> locked the basilica from the inside, preventing worshipers from attending the 6 p.m. Eucharistic liturgy. The liturgy was due to be celebrated in an older style favored by the majority in the local Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly, in which the priest faces the people throughout (<em>versus populum</em>).</p><p>The protesters argue that the celebration of the <em>versus populum </em>Eucharistic liturgy breaches a 2021 decision by the  Synod of Bishops — the Syro-Malabar Church’s supreme authority — that all eparchies (dioceses) should exclusively celebrate the uniform liturgy.</p><p>Video footage showed local police standing outside the basilica, talking through a grille to protesters inside the church. The police appeared to be monitoring the situation and there were no reports of arrests.</p><p>Public celebrations of the Eucharistic liturgy, known as Holy Qurbana, only <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/syro-malabar-basilica-resumes-public">recently resumed</a> at the basilica after a three-year hiatus following physical clashes between supporters and opponents of the new liturgy inside the cathedral.</p><p>The Dec. 1 resumption of Eucharistic liturgies appeared to mark the end of a painful chapter in the <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-churchs-other-liturgy-war">decades-long liturgical dispute</a>. But the occupation could imperil a fragile liturgical peace in the archeparchy.</p><div><hr></div><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;ef3e7db7-c74b-47d3-ac53-fec74a8f3c46&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><div><hr></div><p>The protestors’ move came amid rumors that Syro-Malabar leader Archbishop Raphael Thattil and Archbishop Joseph Pamplany, the archiepiscopal vicar of Ernakulam-Angamaly, were scheduled to meet before Christmas with Pope Leo XIV and officials at the Vatican’s Dicastery for the Eastern Churches.</p><p>The rumors suggested the archbishops were due to update Rome on developments since an agreement was reached in June 2025 permitting the Ernakulam-Angamaly archeparchy’s priests to continue celebrating the Holy Qurbana <em>versus populum</em>, provided that at least one uniform liturgy is offered in each parish on Sundays and feast days.</p><p>Opponents of the new liturgy in the Ernakulam-Angamaly archeparchy argue that the occupation was intended to disrupt the agreement ahead of the rumored Rome meeting.</p><p>But members of the “One Church One Qurbana” movement said they occupied the basilica </p>...</source>
