        <p class="topic-summary">The article describes Russia&#039;s &#039;1,000 bites&#039; approach using small teams to find gaps in Ukrainian lines—a modern application of infiltration tactics developed in WWI. Understanding this historical military doctrine illuminates why small-unit infantry tactics remain essential even in drone-saturated battlefields.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Glide bombs are mentioned as a key Russian weapon for creating gaps in Ukrainian defenses. These precision-guided munitions with extended range have become increasingly important in the conflict, and understanding their capabilities explains why they pose such a significant threat to fixed positions.</p>

I posted a few insights here as a result of the trip. </em></p><p><em>My first dispatch, which covered Ukrainian military training as well as a certain incident with a snake, is <a href="https://mickryan.substack.com/p/ukraine-dispatch-1-military-training">available to read at this link</a>.

The battlefield, strategic strike, information operations, and industrial production campaigns remain crucial to both Ukraine’s and Russia’s war efforts. In all of these endeavors, there is an ongoing adaptation spiral occurring that is spinning out innovative techniques and technologies. At the same time, this is providing insights for Western strategists and force structure planners.</p><p>This white paper provides contemporary insights into the war and offers assessments on what they mean for possible conflict trajectories in the coming months. These insights are based on the author’s multiple visits to Ukraine, including one in October 2025. The seven key findings offer external observers not only an update on this rapidly changing war, but a view from the ground into how the character of war itself is evolving.</p><h2><strong>1. Drone Issues: Saturation and Russian Evolution</strong></h2><p>The eastern front line continues to be saturated with drones.
