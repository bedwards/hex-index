Apparently, rather than waiting for the finalized report that he had ordered, he sent staff the November 28 memo before the scientists had completed their assigned work. </p><p>The final December 5 memo, according to FDA employees with knowledge of the situation, states that under an established WHO framework, <em>zero </em>deaths were deemed “certain” to have been caused by Covid-19 vaccines, <em>two</em> were judged to be “probable/likely,” while <em>five</em> were “possible.”</p><p>Probable/likely cases are those determined to have been “unlikely” due to another cause. But for the “possible” category, an alternative explanation was determined to have been equally likely, meaning that the chance that vaccines were responsible for those deaths was 50-50 at most. </p><p>From this, it appears that the real number of deaths that FDA officials have linked to pediatric Covid-19 vaccines might be as low as zero—but probably rests in the range of 2-5. This means that Dr. Prasad’s memo opened with a number of deaths that is 200%-500% of the number that the scientists he assigned to study the problem reported. </p><p>Since the December 5 memo was posted internally at the FDA, Prasad has not corrected his earlier statements to agency staff. </p><p>The December 5 memo does not provide an analysis of the risk-benefit ratio for pediatric Covid-19 vaccines.
