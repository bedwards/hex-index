        <p>As I mentioned before, the Popehat Report is moving to Beehiiv, a different platform for blogs and newsletters.  You can find it at <a href="https://www.popehat.com/">www.popehat.com</a>. &nbsp; The next email you get from me should be from there.&nbsp; Everyone's subscriptions should transfer over.  The first time I sent an email from there, in a few minutes, it might go to your spam, so you may want to check that.  I will be posting links to everything on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kenwhite.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@kenpopehat">Threads</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057614584451">Facebook</a> so you'll know if you're missing something.&nbsp; You'll be able to subscribe (or unsubscribe, if your time of tolerating me is coming to a middle) just as easily there.</p><p>I made this decision for a number of reasons, only one of which&nbsp;is related to recent controversy.&nbsp; As I said before, I don't judge anyone for deciding to stay on Substack, and I think a preference for a hands-off moderation stance is one of many reasonable approaches to complex and intractable problems.&nbsp; To the contrary, I find the denunciations of people who stay here (or who leave) to be contrived and unreasonable.&nbsp; In fact, I will still be on Substack as a co-host on Serious Trouble, which is hosted here, and I'm fine with that.&nbsp; For my own personal blog, this is what's right for me. &nbsp; I've changed platforms a dozen times writing under the Popehat name and may live to change a dozen more.&nbsp; The new platform will let me make some design changes and be a little more "bloggy," for want of a better word.</p><p>Watch for the first Beehiiv post to follow this one today in a short while.</p>
