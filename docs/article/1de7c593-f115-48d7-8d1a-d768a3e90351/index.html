That was enough to reward leadership, but not so much as to distort the entire economy and alienate workers who could still aspire to the American Dream.</p><p>Today, the gap between CEO pay and the pay of average workers has exploded. The average CEO at a major corporation now takes home nearly 300 times what their employees earn. </p><p>In some cases, the disparity is so grotesque it defies belief. For example: </p><ul><li><p>Walmart’s CEO raked in $27.4 million last year — 930 times the median Walmart worker’s $29,469 salary.</p></li><li><p>Coca-Cola’s CEO made $28 million — nearly 2,000 times what the average Coke worker earned ($14,144).</p></li><li><p>Starbucks’ CEO pocketed $95.8 million in 2024 — almost 3,000 times the typical barista salary of $32,000. (By the way, I urge you to boycott Starbucks until they agree to a first contract with their striking baristas.)</p></li><li><p>Tesla just approved a nearly $1 trillion pay package for Elon Musk — the world’s richest man (except for on September 10, 2025, when Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s net worth briefly surpassed his). This pay package would make Musk the first <em>trillionaire</em> in history.</p></li></ul><p>The problem isn’t just these ridiculous sums. It’s also what’s happening to ordinary workers. </p><p>Undervaluing <em>their</em> labor while overvaluing the labor of CEOs has fueled resentment, anger, disillusionment, and fear — creating conditions ripe for a demagogue to exploit. This is what helped give rise to Trump. </p><p>The yawning gap between the wealth of executives and the everyday people who generate that wealth is beyond obscene. The American people agree: A staggering 62% support setting caps on CEO pay relative to worker pay.</p><p>CEOs aren’t worth nearly what they’re raking in. They get these pay packages because they’ve rigged their boards to award them. </p><p>They’ve also linked their pay to their corporations’ stock prices — and they cash in when their corporations buy back their stock to pump up share prices.</p><p>It’s immoral. Even Pope Leo has noted these concerns: “CEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what </p>...</source>
