        <p>Today’s a new day, with a new opportunity…</p><p>… And you have a chance to “swipe” my secret to engineer your email for (repeatable) success.</p><p>However before we jump into that, I want to pay my respects where they’re due.</p><p>I commend you for showing up today.</p><p>You rolled out of bed, set your ego aside, and actively sought out new, better ways of doing things by reading my emails.</p><p>I’m impressed. And you should be proud.</p><p>I want you to know that.</p><p>Anyways…</p><p>Last week I spent roughly 45 minutes on email.</p><p>That’s a pretty normal week for me, too.</p><p>In fact, not too long ago, just for fun…</p><p>I let my inbox overflow to 500+ emails. Then, I processed it to zero in a matter of about 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole thing was recorded live, and frankly, it was a ton of fun.</p><p>There’s something I want to point out here though — this is quite important, too:</p><p>If you ever stole a sneaky peek inside the average-joe entrepreneur or professional email inbox…</p><p>…You’d find a jungle overgrown with unread messages, where important emails are lost in the thicket.</p><p>They are being swallowed whole by the overgrown inbox.</p><p>And, in some cases, email has literally become their job.</p><p>That’s a huge problem.</p><p>Knee-deep in anxiety, frustration, and overwhelm…all from the notorious culprit — email.</p><p>While important, needle-moving work goes untouched.</p><p>*barf*</p><p><em>So…what’s my secret?</em></p><p>I’d offer it being a simple, proven system that I fall back on each and every day.</p><p>Now, I should put it on the record that it wasn’t always this way…</p><p>Email used to control my life — and embarrassingly, called all the shots.</p><p>It wasn’t until I studied a few high-level colleagues (who were masters with email) that things changed for me.</p><p>First, I learned their principles, patterns, and practices.</p><p>Then, I applied it to my own life.</p><p>This is a system I’ve honed for years and taught to hundreds of my private clients.</p><p>It works.&nbsp;</p><p>It engineers your email for repeatable success.</p><p>Moveover: It only takes a mere 20 minutes to set up — which you only do once.</p><p>As long as you have the discipline to apply 5 steps and 7 rules, you too, will experience for yourself what life on Inbox Zero is like.</p><p>How?</p><p>By “swiping” my exact system.</p><p>You’ll get a step by step system on how to ...</p>
