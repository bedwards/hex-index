      <p>Hey friends,</p><p><span>This is Isaac Saul from </span><a href="https://www.readtangle.com/" rel="">Tangle</a><span>. </span></p><p>I’m just writing with an important note to let you know that we are no longer on Substack. In the last few months, we’ve seen a number of people sign up for our content here on Substack (presumably, because you Google’d us and found a link to our Substack there).</p><p>But we actually moved off of Substack a few years ago. That’s nothing against Substack: We love this platform, the founders, and the network. It was a pure business decision.</p><p><strong><span>Still, if you want to keep up with our work, you need to go to </span><a href="https://www.readtangle.com/" rel="">readtangle.com</a><span> to find us.</span></strong></p><p><span>I’ve tried exporting as many subscribers as possible from Substack over to our Tangle website — so you may already be getting our emails from there. But if not, this is just a courtesy heads up that you’ll find our content </span><a href="https://www.readtangle.com/" rel="">over on that website now</a><span>.</span></p><p>Thank you!</p><p>Best, </p><p>Isaac &amp; the Tangle team </p>
