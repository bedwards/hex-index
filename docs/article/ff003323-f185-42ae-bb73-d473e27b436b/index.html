With the long-running, <a href="https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/us-support-for-israel-staggering-price">staggeringly expensive</a> redistribution of American wealth and weapons to one of the world’s most <a href="https://gfmag.com/data/richest-countries-in-the-world/">prosperous</a> countries under unprecedented threat, Israel’s advocates inside the United States are growing increasingly desperate to suppress the facts, opinions, questions and imagery that are causing this sea change. </p><p>Pro-Israel forces have long worked to limit and shape US discourse to Israel’s advantage. However, the intensity and novelty of what’s taking place in 2025 — from the government-coerced transfer of a social media platform to pro-Israel billionaires, to the jailing and attempted deportation of a student for writing an opinion piece, and more — deserves the attention of every American who values free expression, an enlightened electorate, and independence from foreign influence.  </p><div><hr></div><p>Many Americans know that Congress and President Biden teamed up in 2024 to force the Chinese company ByteDance to divest its US operation of the popular video-sharing app TikTok, yet few realize this unusual intervention was motivated in large part by a desire to serve the interests of Israel. </p><p>Though politicians pointed to the supposed Chinese menace lurking inside the app — while revealing their lack of sincerity by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/biden-campaign-keep-using-tiktok-signed-ban-law-rcna149158">continuing</a> to use it <a href="https://reason.com/2025/01/17/these-lawmakers-actively-use-tiktok-even-after-voting-to-ban-it/">themselves</a> — the catalyst for the extraordinary legislation’s passage was a sea of viral content illuminating Israel’s rampage in Gaza, casting Palestinians in empathetic light, and questioning the legitimacy of the political philosophy that is Zionism. </p><p>The idea that passage of the ban was largely about Israel is no conspiracy theory.  American politicians who supported the compelled divestiture of TikTok have candidly said so themselves. Sharing a stage with Biden Secretary of State Antony Blinken in 2024, then-Senator Mitt Romney <a href="https://x.com/wideofthepost/status/1787104142982283587?s=20">said</a>: </p><blockquote><p>“Some wonder why there was such overwhelming support for us to shut down, potentially, TikTok or other entities of that nature. You look at the postings on TikTok and the number of mentions of Palestinians relative to other social media sites — it’s overwhelmingly so among TikTok broadcasts, so I’d note that’s of real interest to the president, who will get the chance to take action in that regard.”  </p></blockquote><p>Similarly, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/05/04/josh-gottheimer-mike-lawler-campus-protests/">told</a> a webinar that pro-Palestinian student protests were “exactly why we included the TikTok bill…because you’re seeing how these kids are being manipulated by certain groups or entities or countries to foment hate on their behalf </p>...</source>
