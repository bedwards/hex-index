        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly engages with arguments against having children and the philosophical question of whether bringing new people into existence is morally good or bad. Antinatalism is the formal philosophical position that assigns negative value to birth, which Jamil&#039;s arguments partially echo.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The author cites Bryan Caplan&#039;s work on parenting and its limited effects on children&#039;s outcomes. Caplan is an economist known for his contrarian views on education and parenting, and understanding his research provides context for the article&#039;s claims about reducing parenting effort.</p>

And unlike <a href="https://wollenblog.substack.com/">a lot of celebrity writers</a>, she actually writes quite well.  I also faintly recall her reviewing some book I enjoyed, and giving a positive review—so let “I’m pretty sure she liked some book that I also liked,” be a major character endorsement.  However, Jamil recently wrote an article called <em><a href="https://jameelajamil.substack.com/p/i-dont-want-children-i-dont-want">I don’t want children. I don’t want children. I don’t want children. I don’t want children</a>.  </em>You might be able to guess what it was about.   </p><p>The article went insanely viral.  And a lot of it consisted of arguments against having children, rather than mere descriptions of why she doesn’t want children.  For this reason, I thought it would be worth responding to.  My view is that having children is a very good thing.  It’s probably the best thing most people do, rather like donating a kidney.  So while it shouldn’t be compulsory or anything, it’s a good thing to do, and it should be encouraged.  It gives life to a person, <a href="https://benthams.substack.com/p/a-comprehensive-takedown-of-anti">which is a very good thing</a>.  It’s good to live a happy life.  The best thing anyone ever did for you was creating you.</p><p>Jamil <a href="https://substack.com/@jameelajamil/note/c-192824058">described one criticism</a> as “so embarrassingly white,” so hopefully my piece will avoid falling into that trap (despite my <em>embarrassing </em>caucacity).  I’ll also avoid talking about the personal points she makes, like the fact that she doesn’t like kids.  I just don’t really have anything interesting to say about whether Jamil likes kids.  It seems to me that she’d be a better judge of that than me! </p><blockquote><p>I don’t want to voluntarily risk grave, life altering illness, or death for anything or anyone. An astonishing number of women encounter this during pregnancy, and that sounds fucking awful to me. The woman who lost all of her teeth due to pregnancy lives in my head rent free. This is before the aftermath of the 18 months of physical and psychological recovery, hormones falling off a cliff, immense relationship strain, and literal years of insomnia. No thanks! Sorry!</p></blockquote><p>Risk of death or serious injury from pregnancy is fairly low.  About 600 people die from childbearing <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality">in a year</a>, in the U.S..  Your risk of dying from pregnancy is about as high as your risk from dying in a year of driving.  That’s not ...</p>
