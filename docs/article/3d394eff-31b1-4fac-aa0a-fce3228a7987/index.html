        <p>This edition, co-authored with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imran-bayoumi">Imran Bayoumi</a> of the Atlantic Council’s GeoStrategy Initiative, examines how a large-scale US military intervention in Venezuela would weaken the Western alliance to the benefit of Beijing and Moscow. Thanks for reading. </p><p>DC’s military buildup in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela poses underappreciated risks to Europe. Amid escalating tensions, the U.S. has <a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/us-military-b-52-bombers-fighters-venezuela-show-of-force/">moved</a> the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, to the region, B-52H Stratofortress bombers continue to fly off the northern coast of South America, and Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-launch-new-phase-venezuela-operations-sources-say-2025-11-22/">reported</a> on November 23 that the U.S. planned to launch a new phase of operations in Venezuela, likely including covert action against the regime of Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro. While President Trump is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/24/trump-maduro-talks-meeting-venezuela-boat-strikes">reportedly seeking</a> to negotiate directly with Maduro, his administration is also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/26/maduro-defends-venezuela-against-trump-military">threatening airstrikes</a> and appears intent on pressuring the regime through covert means and potentially small-scale military attacks. If these maneuvers fail to break the Maduro regime, however, DC may consider a large-scale military intervention.</p><p>The U.S. should pressure Maduro, who is one of the world’s worst dictators, to leave power. But a large-scale military intervention in Venezuela is deeply unwise and could significantly weaken the U.S. and its allies in the competition with Beijing and Moscow. Any large-scale intervention, such as the one seemingly under consideration, would hold enormous direct costs: the bill for an expanded Operation Southern Spear, Washington’s campaign against alleged Maduro-linked drug traffickers, could well run into the billions of dollars; escalation could also lead to significant casualties or crowd out other defense investments. Trade-offs in the great power competition are already consequential: over a dozen U.S. ships are deployed <a href="https://news.usni.org/2025/11/24/usni-news-fleet-and-marine-tracker-nov-24-2025">around Venezuela</a> instead of higher-priority theaters, such as the Indo-Pacific. Finally, diesel market disruptions will tighten supplies, pushing global prices higher and harming the United States and especially Europe. Russia, the world’s <a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2737236-supply-risks-keep-european-margins-unexpectedly-firm">second-largest</a> diesel exporter, would benefit; Europe, historically the world’s <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/ec7cc7e5-f638-431b-ab6e-86f62aa5752b/European_Union_2020_Energy_Policy_Review.pdf">largest diesel importer</a>, would face weakened terms of trade. If DC conducts a large-scale military campaign in Venezuela, it will weaken the Western alliance and empower the PRC.</p><p><strong>Great Power Implications</strong></p><p>With the future of U.S. action in Venezuela, either covert or overt, now a serious risk, it’s worth tracking the effects on the three largest external actors and regions: European nations, China, and Russia.</p><p><strong>European nations</strong></p><p>Europe faces outsized and underappreciated risks from a large-scale intervention in Latin America. While the effects ...</p>
