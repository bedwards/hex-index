        <p>Hi friends,</p><p>Hope you are surviving this Monday morning. As expected, I had a fabulous time at Steamy Lit Con, where I was able to chat with <a href="https://whattoreadif.substack.com/p/station-eternity-drunk-love-cadaver-king">Jasmine Guillory</a>, caught a panel on pop culture references in romance novels moderated by <a href="https://whattoreadif.substack.com/p/art-thief-detective-aunty-bride">Ali Hazelwood</a> and watched <a href="https://whattoreadif.substack.com/p/princess-and-pi-all-that-glitters-supersaurio">Nikki Payne</a> emcee a <a href="https://www.threads.com/@theeheld/post/DQiAyM0kjXF">costume contest</a>. Oh, and I came home with a suitcase filled with books.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve been catching up on the latest books in some of my favorite series, so I thought I’d spotlight their first installments again to provide some more (gentle) encouragement to check them out.</p><p>And, now, what to read if…</p><h1><strong>You’re Looking for Your Next Family Read</strong></h1><h3><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/nic-blake-and-the-remarkables-the-manifestor-prophecy-angie-thomas/18691335?ean=9780063225138">Nic Blake and the Remarkables by Angie Thomas</a></strong></h3><p>If it’s time for another <a href="https://whattoreadif.substack.com/p/you-loved-this-is-a-robbery">family book club read</a> in you house, grab <em>Nic Blake and the Remarkables. </em>It’s the perfect book for grown-up <em>Harry Potter</em> fans and their kids.</p><p>Twelve-year-old Nic Blake is a Remarkable — a person with magical powers — living in the human world. Her dad, another Remarkable, teaches her the history of magic, but hasn’t yet shown her how to use her abilities. When Nic sneaks out to see her favorite author at a book signing, she accidentally sets off a chain of events that leads to her dad’s arrest, the discovery of a twin brother she didn’t know existed and a quest to find a mysterious magical tool.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg" width="298" height="450.1510574018127" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:662,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:298,&quot;bytes&quot;:147723,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Nic Blake and the Remarkables by Angie Thomas&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Nic Blake and the Remarkables by Angie Thomas&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Nic Blake and the Remarkables by Angie Thomas" title="Nic Blake and the Remarkables by Angie Thomas" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lgab!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe20a51aa-bf7a-4d9a-b154-bc86cfa392a0_662x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Thomas uses her magical world to bring to life aspects of American history and African-American folklore in a way that appealed to my inner history nerd. What I really loved about <em>Nic Blake and the Remarkables, </em>though, is that it’s clearly in conversation with <em>Harry Potter, </em>a series that defined my childhood. Thomas establishes tropes, such as The Chosen One, and then carefully subverts them. I told my then-boss (Hi John!) to buy this for his <em>Harry-Potter-</em>obsessed<em> </em>son as soon as I finished it.</p><p>Book two, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9780063225183">The Book of Anansi</a>, </em>came out in September and continues to build out a delightful magical world — complete with magic basketball league starring giants.</p><h1>You Want Something Cozy</h1><h3><strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9781984880987">The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman</a></strong></h3><p>There’s something about fall that makes makes me want to curl up with a mystery, a cup of tea and a blanket.
