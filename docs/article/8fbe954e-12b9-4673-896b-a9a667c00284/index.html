      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I often find myself thinking that the conventional wisdom in moral philosophy gets a lot of things backwards. For example, I’ve previously discussed how deontology is <a href="https://www.goodthoughts.blog/p/the-curse-of-deontology#%C2%A7the-costs-of-quiet-deontology">much more deeply self-effacing</a> (making <em>objectively right actions</em>, and not just <em>bungled attempts to act rightly</em>, lamentable) than consequentialism. In this post, I’ll explain why I think that only “<a href="https://www.utilitarianism.net/types-of-utilitarianism/#aggregationism">aggregationist</a>” views—on which five people being tortured to death is five times worse (all else equal) than just one person suffering this awful fate—fully respect <a href="https://www.utilitarianism.net/objections-to-utilitarianism/separateness-of-persons/">the separateness of persons</a>.</p><h3>Ethics as Normative Psychology</h3><p>First, some background. Normative ethics <a href="https://www.goodthoughts.blog/p/thinking-clearly-about-reasons#%C2%A7agential-significance">can be understood</a> as specifying what psychological attitudes are warranted towards different objects. To say that <a href="https://www.goodthoughts.blog/p/the-gift-of-life">life is good</a> is to say that it warrants desire or similar pro-attitudes (in an idealized sense that abstracts away from our cognitive limitations).</p><p>So to say that each person’s well-being is a <em>separate</em>, non-fungible good, is to say that we should (ideally) have <em>distinct</em> non-instrumental desires for each person’s well-being. (This is the core idea of my ‘<a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAVR">Value Receptacles</a>’ paper.)</p><p>You could imagine a kind of utilitarian who fails to do this: someone who just has a single desire to maximize aggregate welfare, and sees each person as a constitutive means to this end, just as individual dollar bills are mere constitutive means to your aggregate wealth (you don’t care about the bills <em>as individuals</em>—they are replaceable without regret). Then, rather than feeling torn when forced to choose between two equally worthy lives, this agent would feel stark <em>indifference</em>: the choice of which life to save would seem no more significant to them than the choice between a $20 bill or two tens. I think it would be obscene to view human lives as fungible in this way, so I show how to understand utilitarianism in a way that avoids this flaw (but still allows you to make trade-offs—you can retain commensurability without fungibility). By having separate desires for each person’s well-being, my token-pluralistic utilitarian <strong>values each person separately</strong> in the most literal sense, and this is reflected psychologically in their (i) feeling the loss whenever an individual is harmed, and (ii) feeling a <em>different</em> loss (due to a different desire of theirs being thwarted) depending on <em>which</em> individual is harmed.</p><p>In what follows, I’ll argue that anti-aggregationists fail to value people independently in this way.</p><h3>Belief-Desire Psychology and Independent ...</h3>
