        <p class="topic-summary">The article references illegal arms smuggling to this Zionist paramilitary organization in pre-1948 Palestine. Understanding Haganah&#039;s role in Israel&#039;s founding provides crucial historical context for the article&#039;s claims about connections between organized crime figures and early Israeli state formation.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions the &#039;Birthright Project&#039; founded by Mega Group members Bronfman and Steinhardt. This massive program sending young Jews to Israel is one of the group&#039;s most tangible and influential initiatives, with significant implications for Jewish identity and Israel-diaspora relations.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively references Lansky&#039;s organized crime syndicate and its alleged connections to the Bronfman family and early Zionist arms smuggling.

This final installment will bring us into the 21st century. We will see that the role of Organized Jewry has not just maintained its influence but has increased its role demonstrably. This influence is shown best in a cabal known as The Mega Group. </p><p>I use the term cabal even though The Mega Group as been reported on in mainstream media, the group in real terms is semi-secret. In today’s day and age, we deal in “unknown knowns”, meaning many are now aware of conspiratorial machinations of power but know next to nothing in regard to actual details of this power. The goals of The Mega Group are very similar to the goals of The Parushim<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> and The Focus<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a>: Using the power of a host state (US/UK) as a means of consolidating and increasing Jewish influence in governmental actions and decisions that benefit themselves and Israel. The incestuous nature of private capital merging with the state can be seen clearly in the use of supposed philanthropic or charitable organizations as a cover to steer governmental action and expand wealth.  </p><p>To begin, let’s cover some basics about this group. Journalist Lisa Miller provides some detail in her 1998 article from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. </p><blockquote><p><em>“In working to solve the current crisis, the group is conscious of image: “We want to make it cool to be Jewish,” says Edgar Bronfman, whose company’s keen sense of image has made it one of the world’s most successful marketers.</em></p><p><em>The Study Group moved from discussion to action about four years ago, when Hillel, the Jewish organization on college campuses, needed refinancing. A small group of members agreed to make a $1.3 million combined annual donation over five years. Last year, six Study Group members put up $1.5 million each to help Mr. Steinhardt launch the $18 million Partnership for Jewish Education, a foundation that makes matching grants to Jewish day schools. Currently, Charles Bronfman and Mr. Steinhardt are working on the nascent Birthright Project, which will help send “any young Jew born on this planet” to Israel who wants to go, Mr. Steinhardt </em></p></blockquote>...</source>
