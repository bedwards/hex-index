        <p>The question of what it takes to create — to make something of beauty and substance that touches other lives across space and time — is one of the deepest, oldest questions, perhaps because the answer to it is so unbearably simple: everything. We bring everything we are and everything we have lived to every smallest creative act — every experience, every dream, every memory, every unremembered impression, every unconsciously absorbed influence. The great bewilderment is that we can only access a fraction of our own everythingness — most of it dwells in the recesses of the mind and the psyche, below the level of our surface awareness. Creativity is the periscope through which the unconscious looks out onto the world and renders what it sees. The rendering is what we call art, and it is as much a picture of the seer as of the seen. </p>
<p>In the middle of the world’s most destructive war, <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/tag/carl-jung/">Carl Jung</a> took up this elemental mystery of the creative spirit in a chapter of his 1939 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Man-Search-Soul-Jung/dp/1684226384/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Modern Man in Search of a Soul</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/808346277" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>).</p>
<p>Living in that liminal epoch between the age of mysticism, when creativity was considered a divine gift superintended by muses and shamans, and the age of science, which aimed its forceps and fMRIs at regions of the brain hoping to locate the mind and microscopize the soul, Jung believed that “the human psyche is the womb of all the sciences and arts,” that the unconscious is “the necessary undercurrent of all creativity,” and that to understand how a work of art comes into being is to behold “the warp and weft of the mind in all its amazing intricacy.” Though rigorous and systematic in his approach, he was never seduced by the reductionism science often tends toward, including his own young science of psychology, once writing to a colleague: </p>
<blockquote><p>The creative imagination is the only primordial phenomenon accessible to us, the real Ground of the psyche, the only immediate reality… All other realities are derived from and indirectly revealed by it, actually with the artificial aid named science.</p></blockquote>

<p>Long before psychologist Jerome Bruner itemized <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/04/21/jerome-bruner-on-knowing-left-hand-creativity/">the six pillars of creativity</a> and neurologist Oliver Sacks contemplated <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/11/09/oliver-sacks-the-river-of-consciousness-the-creative-self/">its three essential elements</a>, Jung foregrounds his perspective with a lucid caveat about the limitations of reason in comprehending the unconscious. In a sentiment evocative of Virginia Woolf’s ...</p>
