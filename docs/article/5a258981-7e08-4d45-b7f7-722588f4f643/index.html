      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Readers</p><p>Ryan Lizza, the independent journalist formerly of CNN and POLITICO, asked me to do an interview with him on Friday about my <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/trumps-winning-2024-coalition-has">new column </a>on the outcome of Tuesday’s elections. In this conversation I make several bold claims, such as:</p><ul><li><p>Trump is unpopular and that’s why Republicans lost on Tuesday</p></li><li><p>If Trump continues to be unpopular, Republicans will struggle in the 2026 midterms</p></li><li><p>Realignments are realignments by definition only if they stick</p></li><li><p>People read way too much into narrow debates about ideology and issue positions after the 2024 election, blinding them to trends that would have helped predict 2025 (and 2026/28)</p></li><li><p>Anti-incumbent sentiment is currently the driving force in American politics</p></li><li><p>Democrats should think about politics not as happening on a 1-dimensional left-right ideological spectrum, but a cartesian plane with a vertical pro/anti-system axis too</p></li></ul><p>I also reference data from my <a href="https://www.gelliottmorris.com/p/seven-data-driven-takeaways-from">Tuesday column</a>.</p><p>Have a nice weekend!</p><p>Elliott</p>
