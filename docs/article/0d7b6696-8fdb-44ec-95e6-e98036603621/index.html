          <strong>Second Triumvirate</strong>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions the Second Triumvirate of Marcus Antonius, Lepidus, and Octavianus as the power that ordered Cicero&#039;s death, but doesn&#039;t explain this political alliance&#039;s formation, its proscriptions that killed thousands, or how it differed from the First Triumvirate</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">Cicero&#039;s murder was part of the systematic Roman practice of proscription—the public posting of names of citizens declared outlaws who could be killed for reward. Understanding this institution explains why his death was &#039;legal&#039; violence rather than simple assassination</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses Cicero&#039;s relationship with Caesar Octavianus but doesn&#039;t mention the Philippics—Cicero&#039;s fourteen orations attacking Mark Antony that directly led to his proscription and death, making them essential context for understanding why Antony wanted him killed</p>
