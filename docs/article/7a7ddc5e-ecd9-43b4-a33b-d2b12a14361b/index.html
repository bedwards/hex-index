        <img src="https://www.austinpolitics.net/content/images/2025/11/IMG_3903.jpeg" alt="The budget passes"><p>City Council approved the budget last night. As is the case with almost every other city budget I've covered, most of the debate centered on relatively small numbers. The vast majority of the budget is tied up in fixed costs; it is the loose change at the end that Council has meaningful discretion over. The one exception was the Prop Q budget, but we all know how that turned out. </p><p>The upshot is that the budget Council adopted last night is pretty similar to what City Manager T.C. Broadnax proposed earlier this month in the wake of Prop Q's failure. Council voted unanimously to adopt it. </p>
