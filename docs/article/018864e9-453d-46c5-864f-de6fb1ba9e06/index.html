        <h3>From butterflies to Beethoven, an ode to the heart’s uncontainable dimensions. </h3>
<hr>
<p class="via"><em>A version of this essay appears in the final chapters of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/figuring/"><em>Figuring</em></a></em>.</p>
<p>As if classifying platonic relationships weren’t complex enough a task — one that requires <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/08/16/friendship/">a taxonomy of friendship types</a> — what happens when the platonic and the romantic begin to blur? In an <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/06/21/sartre-love-letter-simone-de-beauvoir/">exquisite love letter</a>, Sartre spoke of “turning abruptly from friendship to love.” And yet what if friendship and love weren’t opposite points between which to pivot but loci that overlap in varying degrees? Under <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/06/30/skye-cleary-why-we-love-ted-ed/">the Romantic ideal of love</a>, we have come to expect that every great romance should also contain within itself, in addition to erotic passion, a robust friendship. But we hold with deep suspicion the opposite — a platonic friendship colored with the emotional hues of romantic love, never given physical form but always aglow with an intensity artificially dimmed by the label of plain friendship. Perhaps we need not label these kaleidoscopic emotional universes after all; perhaps <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/21/clara-schumann-johannes-brahms-letters/">resisting the urge to classify and contain</a> is the only way to do justice to their iridescent richness of sentiment and feeling. </p>
<p>A heartening testament to that possibility comes from the life of the pathbreaking marine biologist, conservationist, naturalist, and <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/12/23/rachel-carson-on-wonder/">wonder-wielder</a> <strong>Rachel Carson</strong> (May 27, 1907–April 14, 1964), who has contributed more than any other person to awakening the modern environmental consciousness — her 1962 book <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/01/27/rachel-carson-silent-spring-dorothy-freeman/"><em>Silent Spring</em></a>, published eighteen months before her life was cut short, led to the creation of Earth Day and the founding of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and sparked the environmental movement as we know it today. </p>

<p>But beneath Carson’s blazing intellect and her protective affection for the natural world lay an interior world as rich and passionate, animated by the same intensity of intelligent love. </p>
<p>In late 1952, just before Carson moved to Maine’s Southport Island with her mother, a local housewife named Dorothy Freeman wrote her a warm letter welcoming her to the close-knit island community. (Carson was already a famous author — her 1951 book <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/08/21/rachel-carson-the-sea-around-us-blue/"><em>The Sea Around Us</em></a> had broken records by remaining on best-seller lists for eighteen months.) Their correspondence blossomed into a fast friendship aglow with anticipation of their first in-person meeting. </p>
<p>On December 30, 1953, Rachel visited the Freemans’ home and stayed for a night. <em>“Reality can so easily fall short of </em>...</p>
