FINSTER:</p><p>On the record, I want to say that the damn thing was none of my doing. What I mean is, it never would have gotten off the ground if I had not been so grievously <em>disobeyed. </em>Normally, seeing as I’m the number two person here, anyone going against what I say gets turfed out quick, but, seeing as it was supposedly in “such a good cause”, I got overruled by the big boss on that one.</p><p>However, that does not mean that it was a <em>good</em> idea. </p><p>Far from it! </p><p>Let me explain….</p><p>*</p><p>It all began when I was busy shuffling paper around like I was before you came in. Typical summer weather-hot- so we were all kind of short with each other, more than usual. But I knew something serious was up when my secretary, Lieutenant Flint, came in.</p><p>“Fish Face is coming in,” she said. “I’m gonna go put cotton in my ears for when….”</p><p>“Who?” I asked.</p><p>“You know! Bess!”</p><p>“Use her <em>proper title</em>, please.”</p><p>“All right! Captain Fishelman. Do we have to go through this all the time? I mean, we all pretty much know each other by now, and….”</p><p>I cut her off with a pre-emptive grunt.</p><p>“<em>Regardless</em> of how much we know, like or dislike each other here in the Cartoon Republican Army”, I said, “we will endeavor to treat each other with <em>respect</em> at all times. This is essential to our smooth, functional operation, both as a full organization and independent units…”</p><p>“You know,” she interrupted, “if you spent less time talking like a textbook all the time, then maybe</p><p>we’d…”</p><p>“Are you implying something, Lieutenant?”</p><p>“No! At least, I didn’t <em>think</em> I was…”</p><p>I glared at her long enough to convey my displeasure with her, and then artificially plastered on a smile.</p><p>“Just get <em>out </em>of my office, and don’t come back here until “Fish Face” gets here- so you can <em>warn </em>me. ‘K?”</p><p>She nodded and exited.</p><p>*</p><p>CAPTAIN B. FISHELMAN:</p><p>Oh, sure. I know that BITCH Finster told you I’m a tool, and that it was me and my ego that fueled the whole shindig. </p><p>Well, she is a 24 karat LIAR! </p><p>This ‘toon fish has given too much of herself to this cause for anyone- especially not that over-ranked COW- not to recognize it. </p><p>Repre-ZENT!</p><p>Now, the timing of this was </p>...</source>
