          <strong>Bantustan</strong>
          <span class="read-time">9 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references &#039;bantustans&#039; as a metaphor for the segregated future the author fears Silicon Valley is creating. Understanding the historical South African system of territorial segregation provides crucial context for the author&#039;s critique of tech-enabled social stratification and apartheid-like structures.</p>

          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses AI as &#039;a vector for revitalizing eugenics and shock therapy&#039; and references the dismantling of the New Deal. Understanding the neoliberal economic policy of rapid privatization and deregulation—particularly its controversial application in post-Soviet states—illuminates the author&#039;s concerns about tech-driven governance.</p>

I have a bit of backlog for essays I need to write, but I’m shifting gears for 2026 to try and keep up with the evolution of our ongoing bubble and its various frontiers—consider this a newsletter reboot. Nonetheless, thank you always to everyone who has read and subscribed and shared and commented and argued and glazed, I’ve deeply appreciated it all and it’s been more helpful than you know.</p><p>To start, here is a roundup of some of my writing over the past year on here:</p><h2>Some Stuff I Wrote This (Last) Year</h2><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/trapped-in-the-maw-of-a-stillborn">Trapped In The Maw of a Stillborn God</a> (January)</p><blockquote><p>An honest look at Palo Alto’s past (<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/san-francisco-silicon-valley-eugenics/">eugenics, environmental ruin, and surveillance</a>) and present (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/18/tech-bros-trump-inauguration-silicon-valley-nation-state">“less a fascism of blood and soil than a nihilistic capitalism of the bottom line”</a> as Quinn Slobodian puts it) suggests the world we’re racing towards will be dominated by bantustans, though I’m sure the Riverians won’t have much qualms about putting casinos inside of them. The sooner we free ourselves of delusions about Silicon Valley’s <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2024/09/19/venture-backed-trumpism-ben-tarnoff/">supposed right-wing turn</a>, the sooner we can <a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/can-ai-break-out-of-panglossian-neoliberalism/">articulate the futures we do or don’t want</a> (and the technologies involved in both) and speak a bit more bravely about the gap between the stakes and our willingness to act. Quickly approaching is the day when we will see the embrace of a genocidal telos (“<a href="https://jacobin.com/2011/12/four-futures/">exterminism</a>”) that’ll seek to sacrifice the environment, genetically and socially engineer humanity, and liquidate the uncooperative elements. All of the ingredients are already there. Now we wait for the Great Work that will bring together the brigands laying waste to our world for one last orgy of violence. Will it be those that seek to purify capitalism of its democratic flaw and colored defects? Or those that promise us it will give birth to yet another stillborn god?</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-consensus-and">The Silicon Valley Consensus &amp; AI Capex Part 1 </a>(March)</p><blockquote><p>The first part looked at AI as a vector for <a href="https://thetechbubble.substack.com/p/ai-life-engineering-and-digital-hygiene">revitalizing eugenics and shock therapy</a>, which has become more apparent as the world’s richest man uses the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-lieutenant-gsa-ai-agency/">pretense of algorithmic efficiency</a> to finish the job <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation">Obama</a>, <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/bill-clinton-neoliberalism-milton-friedman-democrats-market-capitalism">Clinton</a>, <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2001/04/01/neoliberalism-from-reagan-to-clinton/">Reagan</a>, and <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/jimmy-carters-ruinous-neoliberal-legacy/">Carter</a> couldn’t quite manage: burning away what little remains </p></blockquote>...</source>
