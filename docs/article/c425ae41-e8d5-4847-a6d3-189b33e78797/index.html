          <strong>Robert Moses</strong>
          <span class="read-time">15 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author mentions reading &#039;The Power Broker&#039; about Robert Moses and the Fall of New York. Moses was the controversial &#039;master builder&#039; who reshaped New York City&#039;s infrastructure for decades, and understanding his methods and legacy provides deep context for urban planning, power politics, and the tension between progress and community displacement.</p>

          <strong>Six-Day War</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author describes Michael Oren&#039;s book on the Six-Day War as &#039;genuinely thrilling to read&#039; and discusses multiple books on Israeli history. This 1967 conflict fundamentally reshaped the Middle East and remains central to understanding current Israeli-Palestinian tensions, making it highly relevant educational context.</p>

          <strong>Berlin Blockade</strong>
          <span class="read-time">11 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author notes that Truman &#039;navigated the Berlin embargo without getting into nuclear war&#039; - referring to the 1948-49 Berlin Blockade and subsequent airlift. This was a pivotal early Cold War crisis that tested American resolve and established patterns for superpower confrontation, providing rich historical context for the Truman discussion.</p>

        <p><em><strong>First, a request.</strong></em></p><p><em>Yaacov Levitan was killed at the Bondi Massacre. Our sons are friends and classmates. He leaves behind a wife and 4 kids. I would be deeply grateful if you would contribute directly to his family <strong><a href="https://www.charidy.com/yaakovlevitan">here</a></strong>. </em></p><p><em>I have never asked for any payment or a donation before.

And besides — at least you’re not on the Eastern Front.</p></blockquote><p>For some, it may as well have been the Eastern Front.  </p><p>My most popular post this year (and ever) was <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/ambitious-australia">Ambitious Australia</a>. An uncharacteristically optimistic kvetch perhaps, there’s a lot of pent up energy for high agency, big vision optimism for Australia.</p><p>This was followed by my <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/kvetching-with-tyler-cowen">chat with Tyler Cowen</a>, then my recent spicy take on <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/male-inadequacy-drives-infertility">male inadequacy</a>, then my take on <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/hitlers-soviet-delusion">WWII’s Eastern Front</a> (that was a brutal rabbit hole). Somehow my piece on <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/helen-garners-how-to-end-a-story">Helen Garner’s memoir</a> and the <a href="https://www.kvetch.au/p/conclave-and-the-antichrist">movie Conclave</a> did good numbers, the latter (I am told) in Catholic group chats. </p><p>I’ve noticed my Australia essays having an impact on discourse (e.g. on <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/fumbling-for-an-australian-identity">Abul Rizvi and Australia’s bureaucracy</a>, <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/fumbling-for-an-australian-identity">Australian identity</a>, and <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/australian-foment">political stirrings</a>). They’re a mix of reaction and a culmination of a couple years of Australian history reading. I find it odd that US institutions <a href="https://kvetch.substack.com/p/the-bondi-massacre-was-a-choice">occasionally reach out for me to write for them</a> and Australian ones never do. I know you guys read this :) </p><p>This year I wrote a few pieces that I decided would be best left in my drafts folder. One is ‘Sabra and Shatila was a Stitch Up’, but feels too niche and curmudgeonly even for me. Another is ‘Immigration is a Choice’ but I ...</p>
