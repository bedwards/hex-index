        <p class="topic-summary">The novel is set entirely in Kosovo, exploring its capital Pristina, its disputed international recognition (104 of 193 UN members), and the complex ethnic and political tensions between Albanians and Serbs. Understanding Kosovo&#039;s contested sovereignty and post-war status provides essential context for the story&#039;s themes of searching for home in places &#039;going extinct.&#039;</p>

It takes the reader from a NATO-occupied bridge in Mitrovica to the most beautiful parking lot in Kaçanik, from the Kosovo Serb enclave of Štrpce to Pristina’s Old Jewish Cemetery. Along the way it examines the folly of searching for a home in a world where such places are going extinct, and the inflammations that such an innocent quest can produce.</em></p><p><em>Gregory Freedman is a writer currently based in Belgrade.</em></p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p>The first time I saw Michal I was marching in the Pristina Pride Parade.

Pristina, in spite of its status as the national capital of Kosovo—recognized as such by 104 of the 193 members of the United Nations—is a small town. Some might call it a backwater, but doing so would imply the presence of water, and Pristina has none. There was once a Pristina River, they say, but no one can remember where. It was long ago replaced by dirt and rocks and concrete. Sometimes, when you turn on the tap late at night, nothing emerges but a sputter of wind.</p><p>	And yet it’s a beautiful city, in spirit if nothing else. I had lived there for the previous seven months, wandering widely and aimlessly. When you’re an unemployed foreigner in Kosovo who drinks too much and has no local friends, you have to walk a lot. Otherwise, you might forget that you’re in Kosovo.</p><p>I ...</p>
