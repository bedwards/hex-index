He worked as an assistant director on its <em><a href="https://x.com/ani_obsessive/status/1941204989449470179">Anju and Zushiomaru</a></em> (1961) and <em><a href="https://x.com/ani_obsessive/status/1666395296761298947">Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon</a></em> (1963). With the TV cartoon <em>Wolf Boy Ken</em>, he started to direct himself.</p><p>Around ‘65, he moved up in a big way. A senior animator named Yasuo Otsuka wanted to collaborate with him on a feature. The two had grown close; both were active in Toei Doga’s labor union. So, Otsuka battled management until Takahata got his own movie to direct.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a></p><p>From there, a project took shape through meetings between Takahata and Otsuka, plus a few others. Their source material was a ‘60s novel for children, <em>Taro the Dragon Boy</em>, based on Japanese folklore. Toei Doga had batted around the idea of animating it for a few years. Seemingly, Takahata finished at least <em>part</em> of a screenplay, and figured out some of the characters.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a></p><p>This <em>Taro</em> project was shelved at an “early” stage, remembered Otsuka. Among other concerns, the story lacked the “scale” they wanted — the novel isn’t an epic. Takahata and his team took a different route and, ultimately, created <em>Horus: Prince of the Sun</em> (1968) instead. That film changed animation in Japan for good.</p><p>Takahata, Otsuka and many of their friends quit Toei over the next few years. In the ‘70s, they made <em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-real-lupin">Lupin the 3rd</a></em>, <em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/totoro-before-totoro">Panda! Go, Panda!</a></em> and <em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-pressure-that-made-miyazaki-and">Heidi</a></em> elsewhere. Takahata especially had little choice but to leave. He’d burned bridges at Toei — as a top union member and as the head of <em>Horus</em>, which went over-schedule and initially bombed. “[T]he company saw him as their foe,” Hayao Miyazaki explained.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a></p><p>But the studio didn’t forget Takahata’s plan for <em>Taro the Dragon Boy</em>. During the late ‘70s, it was revived. Toei Doga’s reputation had faded a bit in the meantime: lots of its best artists were gone, and the remaining team did faster, less polished, less ambitious work. <em>Taro</em> was meant to be a return.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a></p><p>According to a higher-up at the company, the hope was to make <em>Taro</em> a “culmination of Toei Doga’s 22 years.” There’s an argument </p>...</source>
