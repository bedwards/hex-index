So why, one could say, be afraid of death, when death comes all the time?”</em> And yet even if we were to somehow make peace with <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/01/27/alan-watts-taboo/">our own mortality</a>, a primal and soul-shattering fear rips through whenever we think about losing those we love most dearly — a fear that metastasizes into all-consuming grief when loss does come. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-Goodbye-A-Memoir/dp/B00B9ZG7A2/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>The Long Goodbye</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/long-goodbye/oclc/668193254&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>), her magnificent memoir of grieving her mother’s death, <strong>Meghan O’Rourke</strong> crafts a masterwork of remembrance and reflection woven of extraordinary emotional intelligence. A poet, essayist, literary critic, and one of the youngest editors the <em>New Yorker</em> has ever had, she tells a story that is deeply personal in its details yet richly resonant in its larger humanity, making tangible the messy and often ineffable complexities that anyone who has ever lost a loved one knows all too intimately, all too anguishingly. What makes her writing — her mind, really — particularly enchanting is that she brings to this paralyzingly difficult subject a poet’s emotional precision, an essayist’s intellectual expansiveness, and a voracious reader’s gift for apt, exquisitely placed allusions to such luminaries of language and life as Whitman, Longfellow, Tennyson, Swift, and Dickinson (“the supreme poet of grief”).</p>

<p>O’Rourke writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>When we are learning the world, we know things we cannot say how we know. When we are relearning the world in the aftermath of a loss, we feel things we had almost forgotten, old things, beneath the seat of reason.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Nothing prepared me for the loss of my mother. Even knowing that she would die did not prepare me. A mother, after all, is your entry into the world. She is the shell in which you divide and become a life. Waking up in a world without her is like waking up in a world without sky: unimaginable.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>When we talk about love, we go back to the start, to pinpoint the moment of free fall. But this story is the story of an ending, of death, and it has no beginning. A mother is beyond any </p>...</blockquote>
