        <p>Hi friends,</p><p>My dog had minor surgery last week (she’s recovering very nicely, thank you!), so I’ve spent more time than usual sitting on the couch trying to get her to rest as well. Meaning, I have <em>finally </em>watched “The Thursday Murder Club” movie adaptation on Netflix.</p><p>Mostly, it was an enjoyable two hours that made me even more excited to spend time with these characters when <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9780593653258">the fifth book</a> in the series comes out at the end of the month. But, spoilers ahead, I disagree with one big change from the book (#JusticeForBogdan) and author Richard Osman <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/richard-osman-breaks-silence-over-143000834.html">agrees with me</a>.</p><p>In other news, I am number 207 in line at the library for the new Dan Brown book. Have you read it? Let me know.</p><p>And, now, what to read if…</p><h1><strong>You Followed Every Twist of the Murdoch Succession Battle</strong></h1><h3><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9781250897954">Park Avenue by Renée Ahdieh</a></h3><p>The dispute between media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s children over who would inherit their father’s empire has been marked by so much drama that HBO made a TV show, “Succession,” <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/succession-based-on-rupert-murdoch-drama.html">clearly inspired by it</a>. (In a weird twist, a “Succession” episode caused the siblings to develop a PR plan for their 94-year-old father’s death. So, life imitating art imitating life.) Anyway, for a juicy fictional family inheritance battle, pick up Renée Ahdieh’s <em>Park Avenue.</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg" width="406" height="617.0865384615385" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2213,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:406,&quot;bytes&quot;:733074,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Park Avenue by Renée Ahdieh&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://whattoreadif.substack.com/i/173551378?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Park Avenue by Renée Ahdieh" title="Park Avenue by Renée Ahdieh" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!SMN4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb780d1bb-e8d1-4c71-bd59-c8a3eb530e25_1875x2850.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The morning after she’s named junior partner at her white shoe New York law firm, Jia Song is asked to sit in on a meeting with potential new clients. Jia quickly realizes they’re the Park siblings, whose parents’ beauty empire is worth an estimated billion dollars. The family patriarch, though, is divorcing his dying wife and has offered her a settlement completely out of whack with their supposed net worth. The siblings — convinced their father is hiding funds in shady bank accounts — hire Jia to find the missing funds and force their dad to up his offer.</p><p>Given a month to decode a complex web of financial documents — and even more intricate family dynamics — Jia embarks on a whirlwind tour of the globe on private jets, finding herself more sympathetic to the Parks than she ever would have guessed.</p><p>I had so much fun with this book. It’s a family drama masquerading as a legal thriller, with a mysterious narrator who enjoys playing with the reader. Fans of <em>Crazy Rich Asians </em>or, yes, “Succession” won’t </p>...</source>
