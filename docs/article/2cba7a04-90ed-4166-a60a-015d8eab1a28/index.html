        <p>My friend recently told me about this gut-wrenching documentary.</p><p>He said he almost wished he hadn’t watched it.</p><p>He was angry. Like genuinely upset.</p><p>It’s called “<em>Pet Fooled</em>.”</p><p>The level of manipulation and corruption within the dog food industry completely blew him away.</p><p>Now, I’m not a conspiracy theorist guy.&nbsp; I’m not an “I hate all corporations” guy.</p><p>… But this? This is different — it’s not a conspiracy at all…</p><p>I haven’t seen the documentary. However, based on what he was telling me it’s pretty messed up.</p><p><strong>Now, there’s a point to this story…</strong></p><p><em>Sometimes what you trust — what you’ve been relying on — is actually the thing holding you back.</em></p><p>Maybe that’s dark. But it’s true.</p><p>… And the same goes for productivity and business.</p><p>I’ll explain:</p><p>For years, you’ve probably trusted your systems and routines, right?</p><p>Well, if you trust your systems and habits for the pure reason that <em>you’ve always done them that way</em>…</p><p>… Without questioning or challenging them?</p><p>I’m sorry to say…but the reality is…your systems are probably holding you back in some way.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, at the very least, not as cutting-edge as they could be.</p><p>How can that be? Well…things change.</p><p>Markets change. Businesses change. <em>You</em> change.</p><p>If your systems, habits, and routines aren’t changing with them…you’ll be left in the dust.</p><p>The way I do things today is completely different than how I did them 2, 3, or 4 years ago.</p><p>And today they’re better than ever.</p><p>They’ve evolved.</p><p><strong>At the end of the day, I fall back on what’s useful </strong><em><strong>and</strong></em><strong> effective.</strong></p><p>The best way to find that is by questioning and challenging what you do.</p><p>Make sense?</p><p>Now, I understand that’s an uncomfortable thing to face — <em>change</em> — and it’s certainly not for everyone…</p><p>… But if you’re up for the challenge, and willing to welcome with warm arms…</p><p>A life of freedom, productivity, and profits…</p><p>Today, challenge your systems.</p><p>Question why you do the things you do.</p><p>Dig into it.</p><p>Be ruthless with finding the answers.</p><p>They’ve come. You just need to go deep enough.</p><p><strong><a href="https://go.dansilvestre.com/retirement">&gt;&gt;&gt;Here’s a good place to start</a></strong></p><p>Dan</p>
