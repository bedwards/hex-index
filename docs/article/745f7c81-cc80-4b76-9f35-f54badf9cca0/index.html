        <p>I’ve been under the weather this week so I haven’t been reading much nor have I been up for writing and reflecting. But what I have been doing a lot of is podcast listening. And because I’ve been feeling in a very readerly state of mind even though I’m not reading, I’ve been turning to some of my favorite shows that do what I think of as conversational criticism. I love a discussion between two or more readers where they engage in collective meaning-making—not debate, not an insistence on coming to a consensus, not even a ton of evaluation. I like a robust discussion about what a book is doing where readers attempt to make sense of the piece of art together. </p><p>I always enjoy this kind of show, but I particularly enjoy it when I want to be reading and just can’t seem to read. It makes me feel literary and scholarly and like I’m becoming a better reader without having to focus on a book. So today I’m sharing a handful of my favorite podcasts that give me this feeling and recommendations of where to start with each.</p><p>Before I get into the list, I have to share this incredibly fun conversation I had with <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Petya K. Grady&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:3251207,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a7ab8ef-df2f-478f-8d85-0d556ab542f5_1167x1168.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;1f324757-3cda-4c1f-a726-d3bbbf442772&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> earlier this week. Both of us had been feeling a little bit of end-of-year anxiety about our own reading lives. Will we finish all the books we hope to? Are the best-of-the-year lists going to put us over the edge? How will we fit our reading in during the holiday madness? We went live to provide each other with a little literary therapy and not only was it utterly delightful, it was shockingly successful! We both left feeling lighter and armed with a few new strategies for approaching the last few weeks of the year as readers. You can catch the replay here.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;58e1dfcb-1a49-48b6-9a9e-871f843d784e&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;lg&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Reading without pressure: a little book therapy for the end of the year&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:5760699,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sara Hildreth&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Educator, English M.A., public reader.
