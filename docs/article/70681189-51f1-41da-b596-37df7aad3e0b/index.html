        <p>If there is one thing regular readers of my blog have probably realized, it is that I rarely talk about the “hot” events. It is not that I don’t care what’s happening in the world (quite the opposite), or that I don’t think the news matters (they do). Instead, I prefer to discuss topics that are evergreen, meaning they remain relevant beyond the news cycle. A part of that is just me not having the time to keep up with everything and be up to speed on everything that would make me feel that I have an informed perspective. Another reason is that it’s pretty hard to offer something of value when your voice has to fight a lot of noise to be heard. However, equally importantly, I want Venture in Security to be relevant weeks and months following the newest, the hottest story, and a way to do it is to talk about problems that endure the booms and busts of social media excitement.</p><p>I am saying all this as a preface to the fact that this article is going to be different. Today, I am diving headfirst into the topic of the day, namely the AWS outage. Yet, even here, I’ll be doing it mostly my way.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>This issue is <a href="https://ventureinsecurity.net/p/sponsor">brought</a> to you by… <a href="https://www.dropzone.ai/ai-soc-benchmark-study?utm_campaign=25817487-%5BDigital%20Sponsorship%5D%20Ross%20Haleliuk%2010-21-25&amp;utm_source=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=CSA%20Benchmark%20Study">Dropzone AI</a>.</em></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.dropzone.ai/ai-soc-benchmark-study?utm_campaign=25817487-%5BDigital%20Sponsorship%5D%20Ross%20Haleliuk%2010-21-25&amp;utm_source=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=CSA%20Benchmark%20Study">Most AI SOC Tools Are Still Unproven. This Study Actually Measured Them.</a></strong></p><p>Your board wants proof that AI delivers on security operations, not vendor promises. The Cloud Security Alliance independently tested 148 real SOC analysts investigating actual alerts with and without AI assistance. No sales pitch, no cherry-picked results.</p><p>The findings? AI-assisted teams completed investigations 45-61% faster with 22-29% higher accuracy. Even skeptical analysts became advocates after hands-on use. More importantly, CSA maintained complete control over methodology and results, making this the independent validation your stakeholders actually trust.</p><p>If you’re evaluating AI for your SOC or need data that survives board scrutiny,<a href="https://www.dropzone.ai/ai-soc-benchmark-study"> </a><a href="https://www.dropzone.ai/ai-soc-benchmark-study?utm_campaign=25817487-%5BDigital%20Sponsorship%5D%20Ross%20Haleliuk%2010-21-25&amp;utm_source=sponsorship&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_content=CSA%20Benchmark%20Study">get the full CSA benchmark study here.</a></p><div><hr></div><div><hr></div><h1>The news about the AWS outage is not really about the AWS outage</h1><p>Now I need to clarify something here: I am not actually going to be talking about the AWS outage. There are so many people talking about the ins and outs and reasons and outcomes and whatnot that having one more voice would not add any value. Instead of talking about AWS, I think it’s worth talking about the problem ...</p>
