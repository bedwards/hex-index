        <h3>“The alternations between love and its denial, suffering and denial of suffering … constitute the most essential and ubiquitous structural feature of the human heart.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>“The state of enchantment is one of certainty,” W.H. Auden wrote in <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/10/w-h-auden-commonplace-book-doubt-truth-enchantment/">his commonplace book</a>. “When enchanted, we neither believe nor doubt nor deny: we <em>know</em>, even if, as in the case of a false enchantment, our knowledge is self-deception.” Nowhere is our capacity for enchantment, nor our capacity for self-deception, greater than in love — the region of human experience where the path to truth is most obstructed by the bramble of rationalization and where we are most likely to be <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/01/12/julian-fellowes-snobs-love-lust/">kidnapped by our own delicious delusions</a>. There, it is perennially difficult <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/16/milan-kundera-unbearable-lightness-of-being/">to know what we really want</a>; difficult to <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/08/23/is-sex-necessary-e-b-white-james-thurber/">distinguish between love and lust</a>; difficult not to <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/11/29/stendhal-on-love-crystallization/">succumb to our perilous tendency to idealize</a>; difficult to reconcile <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/10/13/mating-in-captivity-esther-perel/">the closeness needed for intimacy with the psychological distance needed for desire</a>. </p>
<p>How, then, do we really know that we love another person?</p>
<p>That’s what <strong>Martha Nussbaum</strong>, whom I continue to consider the most compelling philosopher of our time, examines in her 1990 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Loves-Knowledge-Essays-Philosophy-Literature/dp/0195074858/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Love’s Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/loves-knowledge-essays-on-philosophy-and-literature/oclc/20354452&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — the sandbox in which Nussbaum worked out the ideas that would become, a decade later, her incisive treatise on <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/11/23/martha-nussbaum-upheavals-of-thought-neediness/">the intelligence of emotions</a>.</p>

<p>Devising a sort of incompleteness theorem of the heart’s truth, Nussbaum writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We deceive ourselves about love — about who; and how; and when; and whether. We also discover and correct our self-deceptions. The forces making for both deception and unmasking here are various and powerful: the unsurpassed danger, the urgent need for protection and self-sufficiency, the opposite and equal need for joy and communication and connection. Any of these can serve either truth or falsity, as the occasion demands. The difficulty then becomes: how in the midst of this confusion (and delight and pain) do we know what view of ourselves, what parts of ourselves, to trust? Which stories about the condition of the heart are the reliable ones and which the self-deceiving fictions? We find ourselves asking where, in this plurality of discordant voices with which we address ourselves on this topic of perennial self-interest, is the criterion of truth? (And what does it mean to look for a criterion here? Could that demand </p>...</blockquote>
