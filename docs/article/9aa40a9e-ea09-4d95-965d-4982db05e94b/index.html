        <p><em>Welcome to the </em>Convivial Society<em>, a newsletter about technology and culture, broadly understood. Before my detour into writing something about Vision Pro, the previous two installments had been a bit more reflective and meditative. This installment is written in a decidedly different mode. It proposes a thesis that I think helps clarify some of the weirdness of our moment. It is at once a commentary on techno-optimist manifestos, the perception of cultural stagnation, effective altruists and effective accelerationists. At least, it is an attempt to provide a useful frame by which these might be understood. The general argument is this: we’ve been secularizing out of a dominant religion, but that religion is not the one we assume it to be. It is rather the religion of technology. I suppose the mode here can be characterized as lightly provocative. As is often the case, the essay grew as I wrote it, but I tried to keep it moving along as best I could. I do hope it provokes a consideration and perhaps some helpful thinking about our moment. One last note in the interest of full disclosure: the links to books will take you to bookshop.org. If you make a purchase, you’ll support local bookstores and a small portion will come my way as well. </em></p><p><em>The </em>Convivial Society <em>runs on a patronage model.

As always, you can tell me otherwise. </p><p>Let’s start here: The most consequential form of secularism has been almost altogether ignored because the underlying religion has not been recognized as such.</p><p>That religion is what historian David Noble called the religion of technology.  </p><p>Off we go.</p><p><strong>1. The more or less standard secularization thesis</strong></p><p>The standard, although now much contested, secularization thesis, ascendent in the 1960s, told a relatively straightforward story about the retreat of religion from modern life.
