        <p><em>Before we start: Elin and I are running a survey on AI usage by software engineers and engineering teams. If you have 10 minutes, please consider taking part by <strong><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/tpe-ai-survey-2026">filling out this survey</a></strong>. This time, we’ll share an extra, longer report – similar to <a href="https://www.pragmaticurl.com/mcp-report">this one on MCP</a> – with everyone who does so. The industry is changing fast, and we’re aiming to provide thorough, grounded analysis of what’s going on. Thank you!</em></p><p>The Christmas break is one of the rare times when my brother, <a href="https://x.com/balintorosz">Balint Orosz</a>, founder of Craft Docs – a popular text editor known for its sleek UX – takes a proper break from work. But that didn’t happen last month: instead, he spent the holidays building AI tools and using AI agents. I assumed this flurry of activity was caused by the same “bug” that’s bitten many techies who’ve seen the recent leap in AI agents’ performance.</p><p>On the first Monday of this year, Balint returned to Craft with a new AI tool they’re calling “Craft Agents”. It’s his take on a more opinionated Claude Code, built on top of the Claude SDK. The company has mandated every engineer and non-engineer to try adding the new tool to their workflows – and they say the results have been jaw-dropping.</p><p>During January, the Craft team has completely changed how they work, and now feel more productive than ever. Also, non-engineers are hooked on using AI with Craft Agents.</p><p><strong>Is it a sign of how mature startups in tech are changing how they build software, using AI tools? </strong>That’s one topic tackled in this deepdive.</p><p>First, some background. Craft has more than 1 million active users, over 50,000 paying customers, and an engineering team of 20 with a median tenure of nearly four years. They care deeply about engineering excellence and product quality: the startup won Apple’s Mac App of the Year award in 2021, and built their own, custom rendering stack to boost user experience above the competition.</p><p>Craft’s AI-first makeover is not a “YOLO” (you only live once) approach like a young startup might try as a way to create some hype. It’s an experienced engineering operation deciding that AI tools have reached an inflection point which means the company <em>needs</em> to change how it works, or be left behind.</p><p>My family ties to Craft mean I’m “in the loop” on things at the ...</p>
