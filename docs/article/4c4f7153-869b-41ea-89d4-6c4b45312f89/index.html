        <h3>“Everything depends on the individual human being, regardless of how small a number of like-minded people there is… on each person… creatively making the meaning of life a reality in his or her own being.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>“To decide whether life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question of philosophy,” Albert Camus wrote in his classic 119-page essay <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/11/07/camus-myth-of-sisyphus-suicide/"><em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></a> in 1942. “Everything else… is child’s play; we must first of all answer the question.” </p>
<p>Sometimes, life asks this question not as a thought experiment but as a gauntlet hurled with the raw brutality of living. </p>
<p>That selfsame year, the young Viennese neurologist and psychiatrist <strong>Viktor Frankl</strong> (March 26, 1905–September 2, 1997) was taken to Auschwitz along with more than a million human beings robbed of the basic right to answer this question for themselves, instead deemed unworthy of living. Some <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/12/18/a-velocity-of-being-helen-fagin/">survived by reading</a>. Some <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/19/viktor-frankl-humor-survival/">through humor</a>. Some by pure chance. Most did not. Frankl lost his mother, his father, and his brother to the mass murder in the concentration camps. His own life was spared by the tightly braided lifeline of chance, choice, and character. </p>

<p>A mere eleven months after surviving the unsurvivable, Frankl took up the elemental question at the heart of Camus’s philosophical parable in a set of lectures, which he himself edited into a slim, potent book published in Germany in 1946, just as he was completing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2019/08/19/viktor-frankl-humor-survival/"><em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></a>. </p>
<p>As our collective memory always tends toward amnesia and erasure — especially of periods scarred by civilizational shame — these existential infusions of sanity and lucid buoyancy fell out of print and were soon forgotten. Eventually rediscovered — as is also the tendency of our collective memory when the present fails us and we must lean for succor on the life-tested wisdom of the past — they are now published in English for the first time as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yes-Life-Everything-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080700555X/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Yes to Life: In Spite of Everything</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything/oclc/1125351500&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>). </p>
<p>Frankl begins by considering the question of whether life is worth living through the central fact of human dignity. Noting how gravely the Holocaust disillusioned humanity with itself, he cautions against the defeatist “end-of-the-world” mindset with which many responded to this disillusionment, but cautions equally against the “blithe optimism” of previous, more naïve eras that had not yet faced this gruesome civilizational mirror reflecting what human beings are capable of ...</p>
