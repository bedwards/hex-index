        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly references Stephen Glass as an &#039;obvious example&#039; of journalism&#039;s fabricators. His case is one of the most notorious journalism fraud scandals in American history, and understanding his methods and downfall provides essential context for this new AI-enabled era of media deception.</p>

All of it was AI-generated—even the author portraits. They swiftly took the content down. It isn’t hard to find similar examples of generative fakery. So, in one sense, there’s nothing fundamentally new in what you reported. The increasingly synthetic nature of journalism is something we have to deal with and worry about all the time. But your story feels different. Why do you think the reaction to it has been so dramatic?</strong></p><p>That’s a good question. The example of the <em>Sports Illustrated</em> stories is, in my mind, pretty reprehensible. But, in that case, the shell of a once great magazine decided to use AI to create stories. This is more a situation where you see publications being duped by bad actors who, aided by technology, are sneaking in stuff that appears totally made </p>...</source>
