        <h3>“You are this body, and you are these molecules, and you are these atoms, and you are these quantum entities, and you are the quantum foam, and you are the energetic field of space-time, and, ultimately, you are the fundamental awareness out of which all these emerge.”</h3>
<hr>
<p>“This life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece of the entire existence, but is in a certain sense the whole,” quantum pioneer Erwin Schrödinger wrote as he <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/11/03/erwin-shcrodinger-my-view-of-the-world/">bridged his young science with ancient Eastern philosophy</a> to reckon with the ongoing mystery of what we are.</p>
<p>A century later — a century in the course of which we unraveled the double helix, detected the Higgs boson, decoded the human genome, heard a gravitational wave and saw a black hole for the first time, and discovered thousands of other possible worlds beyond our Solar System — the mystery has only deepened for us <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/04/22/richard-feynman-yo-yo-ma/">“atoms with consciousness,”</a> capable of music and of murder. Each day, we eat food that becomes us, its molecules metabolized into our own as we move through the world with the illusion of a self. Each day, we live with the puzzlement of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/10/07/rebecca-goldstein-personal-identity/">what makes us and our childhood self the “same” person</a>, even though most of our cells and our dreams have been replaced. Each day, we find ourselves restless miniatures of a vast universe we are only just beginning to fathom. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Complexity-Scientific-Connection-Consciousness/dp/1954118252/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Notes on Complexity: A Scientific Theory of Connection, Consciousness, and Being</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/1378021952" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>), the Buddhist scientist <strong>Neil Theise</strong> endeavors to bridge the mystery out there with the mystery of us, bringing together our three primary instruments of investigating reality — empirical science (with a focus on complexity theory), philosophy (with a focus on Western idealism), and metaphysics (with a focus on Buddhism, Vedanta, Kabbalah, and Saivism) — to paint a picture of the universe and all of its minutest parts “as nothing but a vast, self-organizing, complex system, the emergent properties of which are… everything.”</p>

<p>Theise defines the core scientific premise of his inquiry:</p>
<blockquote><p>Complexity theory is the study of how complex systems manifest in the world… Complexity in this context refers to a class of patterns of interactions: open-ended, evolving, unpredictable, yet adaptive and self-sustaining… how life self-organizes from the substance of our universe, from interactions within the quantum foam to the formation of atoms </p>...</blockquote>
