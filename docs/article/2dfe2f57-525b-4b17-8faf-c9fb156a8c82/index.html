          <strong>Advent</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article opens by framing the church calendar around Advent, making it central to understanding the liturgical context McKnight is working within. Most readers know Advent exists but few understand its rich theological history, varying traditions across denominations, and how it shapes Christian worship practices.</p>

          <strong>Epiphany (holiday)</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">McKnight mentions Epiphany as part of the church calendar sequence, but unlike Christmas, Epiphany is less understood by general readers. Its significance as the conclusion of the Twelve Days of Christmas and its varying observances across Christian traditions would provide valuable context.</p>

          <strong>Walter Isaacson</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions discussing Walter Isaacson&#039;s work on &#039;self-evident truths&#039; in American history. Understanding Isaacson&#039;s background as a biographer of Franklin, Einstein, Jobs, and Musk, plus his historical writing approach, would enrich the reader&#039;s engagement with the upcoming book discussion.</p>
