        <p><em>(This is a chapter of a longer report I’m working on that summarizes and expands the last several years of my work on construction productivity. I plan on publishing one chapter a month on the newsletter, and aim to have the full report done by the end of the year.)</em></p><p>For decades, American construction has fallen behind almost every other major sector in productivity growth. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.67.2.861">As far back as 1970</a> researchers noted that construction productivity improvement significantly lagged productivity improvement in the economy overall, and by 1985 <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w1555/w1555.pdf">economists were investigating</a> what appeared to be declining construction productivity. Stanford civil engineering professor Paul Teicholz noted in a<a href="https://www.aecbytes.com/viewpoint/2004/issue_4.html"> 2004 article in AECbytes</a> that between 1964 and 2004, construction productivity declined by 0.59% per year on average, which was “particularly alarming when compared to the increasing labor productivity in all non-farm industries, which have experienced an increasing productivity of 1.77%/year over the same time period.” A <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2017/08/19/efficiency-eludes-the-construction-industry">2017 article in The Economist</a> noted that “construction holds the dubious honour of having the lowest productivity gains of any industry.” In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/economy-construction-productivity-mystery.html">2023 New York Times column</a>, Ezra Klein wrote that “A construction worker in 2020 produced less than a construction worker in 1970, at least according to the official statistics.”</p><p>The trend of construction productivity in the United States failing to improve over time is indeed concerning. “Productivity” means some measure of output, divided by some measure of input. When productivity is improving, we get more output for a given amount of input over time; if productivity is falling, we get less output for a given amount of input over time. If productivity doesn’t improve, we can’t expect construction costs to fall and things like houses, roads, and bridges to get any cheaper. Because of this, it’s worth looking deeply at what exactly the trends in US construction productivity are.</p><p>Economists and researchers measure construction productivity in a variety of different ways. We can broadly categorize these metrics by their <em>level of granularity:</em></p><ul><li><p>At the lowest level of granularity, we have metrics that track productivity changes across the entire construction sector.</p></li><li><p>Slightly more granular are metrics that look at productivity changes in a particular subsector, such as housing construction.</p></li><li><p>Looking more specifically, we have metrics that look at productivity changes for constructing particular buildings.</p></li><li><p>And finally we have metrics that track productivity changes for individual construction tasks.</p></li></ul><p>Each category of metric gives a slightly ...</p>
