His advice was this:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>I would recommend sitting in a chair for five minutes — 10, if you have time — every day without doing anything. Simply being still, listening to the stillness.</em></p><p><em>That is one of the great liturgical motifs of Christmas, that in the midnight silence, when everything was still, the Word came. The Word didn’t come with a huge cry. But the Word came as an infant. In Latin, ‘infans’ means ‘speechless.’ Again, that’s one of those great paradoxes that the Fathers loved: that the Word chose to be among us as someone, as any infant is, deprived of speech.</em></p><p><em>Recovering, and perhaps even discovering, that deep silence within ourselves will help to make us realize that that isn’t an emptily resonant space, but in fact, it is an inhabited space, and a space of openness, and we could almost say of hospitality, because all of us yearn for that receptivity to the Word coming among us, and coming to you and coming to me.”</em></p></blockquote><p>If that wasn’t enough, the bishop <a href="https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/the-word-didnt-come-with-a-huge-cry-but-as-an-infant-norways-bishop-varden-on-the-incarnation">offered insight</a> into his own Christmas meditations:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The reason God needed to become Man was to overcome mortality, which is the wages of sin, and so restore to humanity that opening towards eternity for which it was made, and for which it was intended. The memory of that promise of immortality remains within us, mortals, human beings, as a kind of a wound almost, a painful yearning whose promise needed to be restated and realized afresh.</em></p><p><em>So because human nature had been wounded </em></p></blockquote>...</source>
