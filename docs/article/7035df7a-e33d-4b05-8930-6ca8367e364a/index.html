      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Happy Thanksgiving, and welcome to the FIRST EDITION of Waco Can’t Wait, a progressive newsletter focusing on Mclennan County, Texas, and Federal politics. I will be providing a “Week In Review” of important news, a preview of upcoming allied events in Waco/McLennan County, and my own commentary on things that are happening.</p><p>I have been looking forward to doing a deep dive into how Texas Redistricting has affected McLennan County, what the statewide landscape looks like, and what some bright spots might be. If you’re looking for a distraction from your family, this should surely suffice. </p><p>But first, let’s look at the news!</p><h3>Week in review (a collection of articles from Waco, Texas, and beyond)</h3><p><strong>Waco:</strong></p><p><a href="https://wacotrib.com/news/local/education/waco-isd-trustee-cary-dupuy-resigns-from-board-after-10-years/article_a6e2c45a-4957-11ec-b9a9-dba578dd8d9d.html">Cary Dupuy has announced his resignation from the Waco ISD Board of Trustees</a>, and there is now a vacancy on the Board for the fourth time in three years. It is worth mentioning that Hope Balfa Mustakim<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a>, DuPuy’s opponent in November 2020, called for DuPuy to commit to serving his full term if he won reelection. He would not make that commitment then, and it is clear where he stands on the issue now. </p><p>Where does that leave us? The Board of Trustees needs to call a special election for this seat during the regularly scheduled May 2021 election, and it needs to leave this seat vacant until then. Waco ISD voters deserve a real choice for this seat, and their judgment should not be substituted by the Board’s. The next Public Hearing is on <a href="https://www.wacoisd.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=1985&amp;DomainID=2487#calendar1856/20211130/event/12917">November 30 from 6:00-7:00pm</a>, and the next School Board Meeting is on <a href="https://www.wacoisd.org/site/Default.aspx?PageID=1985&amp;DomainID=2487#calendar1856/20211216/event/11121">December 16 from 6:00-8:00 pm</a>. If you have opinions, bring them.

I hope you’ll consider checking out her campaign, making a contribution, and signing up to volunteer for a great local candidate.</p><p><strong>Texas:</strong></p><p>It is official. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/15/beto-orourke-texas-governor-2022/">Beto O’Rourke is running for Texas Governor</a>, and it goes without saying that Texas Democrats are excited. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/17/beto-orourke-fundraising-election-governor/">He raised $2,000,000 in the first 24 hours, and the money faucet shows no signs of stopping.</a> Beto will bring energy, volunteer power, ...</p>
