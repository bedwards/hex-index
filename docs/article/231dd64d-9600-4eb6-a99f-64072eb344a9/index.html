        <p>When people talk about the state of cybersecurity, the three “truths” seem to come up again and again: 1) that there are too many startups, 2) that the industry is way too crowded, and 3) that CISOs are bombarded by vendor outreach more than any other executives. These narratives aren’t totally wrong, but they usually miss the bigger picture. If we zoom out and compare security to other industries, historical context to today’s reality, and perception to actual data, the story becomes much more nuanced and far more interesting. In this piece, I am addressing these three usual complaints and sharing my perspective on why they aren’t exactly fair. I am sure some people will disagree with the way I look at things, but that’s exactly why it’s interesting to have a healthy debate.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong><a href="https://hero.permiso.io/ai-security-cheat-sheet?utm_source=venture-in-security&amp;utm_campaign=ai&amp;utm_medium=sponsored&amp;utm_content=newsletter">Stop AI Identity Sprawl Before It Becomes Your Biggest Risk</a></strong></p><p> AI is everywhere, fueling productivity but also creating new blind spots.

What’s interesting is that each time I hear this, people are generally right, but as soon as they start analyzing the reasons why it happened, in my opinion, they are generally wrong. The cost of living in most cities has indeed increased, and especially so in large urban centers, but it isn’t just because of evil developers or tech people moving in (though these certainly play a role). Instead, housing and urban living have become more expensive because of a mix of long-term structural forces that are often invisible in day-to-day debates, from land-use restrictions and zoning, underbuilding after past recessions, infrastructure and regulatory costs, the fact that housing in major cities all over the world has become an investment asset for global wealth, demographic and cultural shifts like the fact that we ...</p>
