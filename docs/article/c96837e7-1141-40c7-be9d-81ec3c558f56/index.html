        <p>A fun thing to do in the days after Thanksgiving is to log-in to payment company dashboards and watch the world shop live. As of this writing, <a href="https://bfcm.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> has ushered 24 million unique shoppers through its platform since Black Friday commenced; <a href="https://bfcm.stripe.com/">Stripe</a> has processed 92 million transactions. Tariffs may be eroding discounts on offer, but consumers are undeterred. At this rate, both firms look set to exceed records they achieved over Black Friday Cyber Monday weekend last year, when Shopify hit peak sales of $4.6 million per minute and Stripe did total transaction volume of $31 billion.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png" width="1456" height="817" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:817,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5179595,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.netinterest.co/i/180194501?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dv1b!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F544915ab-b089-4ab0-bdc7-8c6917011bd4_2796x1568.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://bfcm.shopify.com/">Shopify live BFCM dashboard</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>What makes this year different is that both companies have AI agents wandering through their pipes alongside regular human users. Shopify has already seen AI-driven traffic to its stores increase seven-fold since January, with orders attributed to AI searches increasing by 11x. That is only likely to grow. According to a <a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/agentic-ai-in-retail-how-autonomous-shopping-redefining-customer-journey/">recent survey</a> conducted by Bain, 17% of US consumers say they’ll start their online holiday shopping this year with ChatGPT, Perplexity or another general AI assistant. Although lower than the 73% who still start with Amazon, it’s a share that is only going up.</p><p>It also reflects a new way of shopping. AI is already used widely for research and product comparison. As AI assistants integrate these features with search, they are additionally being used by consumers as a marketplace. Ultimately, we’re heading for a world in which AI should be able to navigate shopping options, negotiate deals and execute transactions independently of human direction. “Find me a pair of waterproof hiking boots in a size 8 under $150 that can be delivered by Friday,” could be something you would ask, and the agent would be able to scan available options, query product data in real time, check return policies, read shipping estimates, verify availability and place the order.</p><p>“We’re entering what is likely to be a whole new era of agentic commerce,” Shopify president Harley Finkelstein told investors earlier this month. His CEO, Tobi Lütke, is similarly bullish. Agentic commerce “will be done a lot and might even be a majority of commerce on the internet,” he <a href="https://cheekypint.substack.com/p/tobi-lutke-is-still-captivated-by">told</a> John Collison, president of Stripe. Amazon’s Andy Jassy goes further: “I do think that the exciting part of this, and the promise, is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens </p>...</source>
