Tiny Budd, the vice president at the time, and a few other members began working with the Peterborough &amp; District Labour Council and the community to develop plans for a housing co-op in the city. The first ten co-op townhouses were purchased with federal funds in 1979, as part of a federal program aimed specifically at supporting co-operative housing initiatives. This program, which ran from 1979 to 1985, was administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and provided financial assistance to such co-operatives in the form of monthly subsidies for low-income members. In the early 1980s, the Peterborough Co-operative expanded to a second location on Chamberlain Place.</p><p>According to Janine McDonald, the co-operative’s long-time property manager, the co-operative has been a saviour for many low-income families throughout the years. The co-op now has fifty-nine townhouse units—five two bedrooms, fifty-three three bedrooms, and one four bedroom—and it accepts applications from people at all economic levels.</p><p>In 2024, rent for a three-bedroom apartment in the co-op was $828 a month, a very affordable price compared to the $1,687 for a much smaller one-bedroom apartment listed on <em>kijiji.ca</em> in the same city. Twenty of the townhouses in the complex have even more budget-friendly rates thanks to governmental subsidies for “geared to income” housing.</p><p>Budd, now seventy-six years old, is one of the co-op’s longest-tenured tenants. She and her fellow residents run the co-op together, making decisions about renovations and financial management together. They don’t need to fear being evicted by a landlord who wants to sell or renovate their buildings. Budd appreciates the fact that her co-op community has her back and that her neighbours care about her well-being. The folks in the community mow her lawn, volunteer to do her grocery shopping, and drive her when needed.</p><p>Kerri-Anne Hinds, her husband, and two kids live in a three-bedroom townhouse at the co-op that is perfect for their family of four. It boasts a finished basement and a garden. Hinds works part time at a bookshop, and the couple receives disability assistance payments from the province of Ontario as a result of a spinal injury her husband incurred on the job.
