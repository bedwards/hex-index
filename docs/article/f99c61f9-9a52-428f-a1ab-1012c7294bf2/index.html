        <p>Welcome back to “One First,” a newsletter that aims to make the U.S. Supreme Court more accessible to lawyers and non-lawyers alike. I’m grateful to all of you for your continued support, and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:</p><h3>The First Three Years of One First </h3><p>Three years ago today, “One First” <a href="https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/hello-and-welcome-to-one-first">went live. </a>Although I do the bulk of the writing, the reality is that this entire operation was actually the brainchild of <a href="https://risepointsearch.com/about-karen">my wife, Karen</a>. After I finished writing <em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/stephen-vladeck/the-shadow-docket/9781541605183/">The Shadow Docket</a></em> in 2022, Karen felt strongly that I needed to be one of the voices out there trying to explain Supreme Court decisions and procedure at a more widely accessible (and more frequent) level. So we spent a bunch of nights after our two daughters went to sleep brainstorming how to pull that off. Karen eventually suggested a periodic newsletter—and, as usual, she was right.</p><p>A <em>lot </em>has changed in our lives since then. First, for those who have been following us for a while, we left Texas in 2024 to return back to D.C., where I <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/stephen-i-vladeck/">joined the faculty</a> at Georgetown Law last summer. Karen has continued to thrive professionally, <a href="https://www.stevevladeck.com/p/a-very-special-karens-corner-the">launching</a> Risepoint Search Partners—<a href="https://risepointsearch.com/">a legal recruiting firm</a>—at roughly the same time. The newsletter has, ironically, been a constant even as we’ve embarked upon these exciting life changes.</p><p>I’ve also been trying to think through other ways of pursuing the same goal of raising the level of public understanding and discourse relating to the Supreme Court—from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@steve_vladeck">launching a TikTok </a>to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ksvesq.bsky.social/post/3llymazy6mc2g">signing on to write a second book about the Court</a>, this time with Viking, which will take a more macro look at the Court, including how we got to where we are today; and how (and why) we should fix it.</p><p>And last, our two daughters, who at the time of the launch still seemed so very young, are growing into awesome tweens who make us laugh—and keep us on our toes—every day. Indeed, our younger daughter Sydney remarked the other day that “I can’t believe people actually <em>read</em> that thing” (meaning this newsletter). There’s nothing like young kids—especially daughters—to keep you humble.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg" width="728" height="802.9271696467509" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:2529,&quot;width&quot;:2293,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:1414975,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.stevevladeck.com/i/178416089?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8243d1c8-f7f0-4470-bfa1-4c1c095a691c_2316x3088.heic&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!20ky!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec7512d2-37dc-41be-b7ba-ad3a67fe5e6b_2293x2529.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Karen says this is a picture from one of our newsletter planning “meetings” in 2022.
