It was only today that it started showing Jasmine Crockett and Chip Roy, among other candidates who filed on Monday.  There are some candidates who I know filed on Monday and are still not showing.</p><p> But I have searched low and high for candidates on the ballot, who made it and filed with the county before the Monday 6 pm deadline, and I’m about 97% sure I have everyone on the lists. </p><p>Check it out: </p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/who-will-be-on-the-2026-state-ballot">Who Will Be On The 2026 State Ballot?</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.lonestarleft.com/p/who-will-be-on-the-2026-federal-ballot">Who Will Be On The 2026 Federal Ballot?</a></p></li></ul><p>I reached out to the Texas Democratic Party (TDP) and asked whether they knew when the SOS website would be fixed. They said Friday. It is so exciting that we have so many competitive Democratic primaries here in Texas that I’m <em>figuratively</em> dying waiting to talk about some of these races. But since there are so many, this will be in a couple of parts, and since I’m 97% sure anyway, we’ll start with races I know 100% about first. 😁</p><p><em>I took all of the (Independent, Green, Libertarian) off. The SOS isn’t showing them, and they may or may not be on the ballot before the primary is over, so I didn’t want to add to the confusion since they won’t be on the ballot until November anyway. </em></p><h4>Statewide races. </h4><p>If you thought I was going to start with the most talked-about race in America, you’d be right. Only to say, there’s <a href="https://jamestalarico.com/">James Talarico</a>, <a href="https://www.jasmineforus.com/">Jasmine Crockett</a>, <a href="https://hassanfortexas.com/">Dr. Ahmad Hassan</a>, and Lelonda Reese (who doesn’t have a website). </p><p>The only other thing I’m going to say about that race for now is that there are a lot of people who don’t live in Texas who have opinions about Texas politics, and most of them are wrong.</p><p><strong>The Governor’s race.</strong> </p><p>Now, I am going to talk about this and change my previous prediction based on the changed dynamics. There are now <strong>11 Democrats running in the Democratic primary</strong>. I have previously endorsed  <strong>⭐</strong><a href="https://ginafortexas.com/">Gina Hinojosa</a><strong>⭐, </strong>and I’m still expecting her to win the Democratic primary. Now, will we go to a runoff? </p><p>First of all, at least five of the candidates don’t even have a website yet. There are 81 days until the primary election. So, I don’t </p>...</source>
