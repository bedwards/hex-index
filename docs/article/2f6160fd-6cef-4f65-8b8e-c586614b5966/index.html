We’ve got the inaugural entries of 2021 for <em>Superorganizers</em> and <em>Free Radicals</em>, both of which contain cream-of-the-crop writing and insight. Per usual, <em>Means</em> <em>of Creation</em> put the team on its back with another duo of well-rounded roundup and live conversation. And Tiago Forte took us back to Note School once again. </p><p>All that should be enough to tide you over until Tuesday, so sit back, dig in, and see you in two days!</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>What We Published</strong></h2><p><em>The lowdown on this week’s output, including&nbsp;<strong>three articles</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>two conversations.</strong></em></p><h5>📝<em>ARTICLES</em>📝</h5><h3>⚡️ <a href="https://superorganizers.every.to/p/how-hard-should-i-push-myself">How Hard Should I Push Myself?</a></h3><p>by Dan Shipper in<em> Superorganizers</em></p><p><em>Superorganizers </em>returns with a deep, transparent, and open-minded look at a quandry faced by anyone who works: <em>“How much stress is good, and how much is bad?” </em>Shifting between his own personal experience and scientific research on stress, Dan finds a nuanced corner of an area that is often reduced to monolithic Dos and Don’ts. “Stress isn’t good or bad. It’s a tool,” he writes. Armed with science-based coping strategies,  this ode to balance reframes conquering stress as a daily practice, not an insurmountable task.</p><p><strong><a href="https://superorganizers.every.to/p/how-hard-should-i-push-myself">Read</a></strong> (<em>8 minutes</em>)</p><h3>🦠 <a href="https://free-radicals.every.to/p/leadership-is-a-verb-leigh-ann-buchanan">Leadership is a verb: Leigh-Ann Buchanan is shaping a new generation of innovators</a></h3><p>by Sherrell Dorsey in<em> Free Radicals</em></p><p>As founder of a nonprofit aimed at “bridging the gap between talent and access” for Miami’s burgeoning tech community of creative minds, Leigh-Ann Buchanan has plenty of insights on what it means to foster community, and which qualities are necessary to maintain support for innovators—especially in uncertain times. She brings all that to her conversation with Sherrell here. To Buchanan, companies have a responsibility to avoid neutrality and treat their employees as individuals. “If you, as a leader of an institution cannot make a statement that may not be political, but that is grounded in how you see people,” she says, are you leading?” This is essential reading for employees and employers alike.</p><p><strong><a href="https://free-radicals.every.to/p/leadership-is-a-verb-leigh-ann-buchanan">Read</a></strong> (<em>15 minutes</em>)</p><h3>💝 <a href="https://means-of-creation.every.to/p/snapchats-attempt-to-mint-their-own">Snapchat’s Attempt to Mint Their Own Celebrities</a></h3><p>in <em>Means of </em></p>...</source>
