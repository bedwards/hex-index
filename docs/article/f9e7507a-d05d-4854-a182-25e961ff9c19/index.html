        <p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court found that the tariffs Trump levied under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are unconstitutional, Trump has attacked the court and continued to insist he has the power to issue the tariffs that give him economic leverage over other countries and companies.</p><p>After the decision was announced on Friday, Trump announced he was putting a 10% tariff on foreign imports. Then, on Saturday, he posted that his social media announcement would “serve to represent that I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”</p><p>At 7:06 this morning, Trump tried to reaffirm his unchecked power when he posted on social media: “The supreme court (will be using lower case letters for a while based on a complete lack of respect!) of the United States accidentally and unwittingly gave me, as President of the United States, far more powers and strength than I had prior to their ridiculous, dumb, and very internationally divisive ruling.” He claimed that he could “do absolutely ‘terrible’ things to foreign countries” and that the court has approved other tariffs that “can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used.”</p><p>On Sunday the head of the international trade committee in the European Parliament, Bernd Lange, posted: “Pure tariff chaos on the part of the US government.

Late last month, India and the E.U. completed a trade agreement that creates the largest free trade zone in the world.
