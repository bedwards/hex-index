        <div class="pullquote"><p>Every Russian soldier has to be shot dead twice, and even then he has to be pushed to make him fall.</p><p>— Frederick the Great</p><p>The effect of climate in Russia is to make things impassable in the mud of spring and autumn, unbearable in the heat of summer and impossible in the depths of winter.

We must not lose our courage. If others win the war, and if they do to us only a fraction of what we have done in the occupied territories, there won’t be a single German left in a few weeks.” It became so quiet in that carriage that one could have heard a pin drop.</p><p>— Antony Beevor, Berlin: The </p>...</div>
