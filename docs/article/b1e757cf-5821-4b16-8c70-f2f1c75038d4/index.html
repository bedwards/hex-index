        <p class="topic-summary">The article extensively references Samir Amin&#039;s economic theories but assumes familiarity with his background. Understanding his intellectual development, Marxist framework, and specific contributions to dependency theory would deepen comprehension of the delinking concept he pioneered.</p>

His specific policies on food sovereignty, debt repudiation, and anti-imperialism directly illustrate the article&#039;s theoretical concepts.</p>

He started from the observation that the capitalist world economy is characterised by a stark division of labour between the imperial core (often glossed as the global North) and the periphery (the global South).</p><p>In this system, the core states seek to monopolise the most profitable forms of production and establish control over global commodity chains, while preventing sovereign development in the periphery to maintain it as a subordinate supplier of cheap labour.  Southern labour and resources are roped into producing things like sweatshop goods and plantation commodities for the core, at compressed market prices, rather than producing for local human needs and national development.</p><p>Amin pointed out that this system is characterised by large core-periphery price disparities and therefore <strong><a href="https://globalinequality.org/unequal-exchange/">unequal exchange</a> </strong>in international trade. The South is made dependent on imports of technologies and producer goods from the core at monopoly prices, and to pay for this they have to export massive quantities of artificially cheapened commodities and manufactured goods, thus generating a net-<a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/s/Hickel-et-al-Plunder-in-the-post-colonial-era.pdf">transfer of value</a> from the periphery to the core. This enriches the core but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937802200005X">drains the periphery</a> of resources necessary for development.</p><p>This system produces and perpetuates poverty and underdevelopment in the South. There is nothing inevitable about poverty; it is an effect of imperialist dynamics in the world economy. The global South has extraordinary productive capacities; massive labour power, land, factories and resources. The problem is they do not have sovereign control over production.</p><p>To address this problem, Amin called for a process of <a href="https://www.inthenet.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Samir-Amin-A-Note-on-the-Concept-of-Delinking.pdf">delinking</a>, which for him contains two key elements: </p><p>1) <strong>Delink from exploitation by the imperial core</strong>. Southern states should end dependence on imports from the core, and end dependence on imperial capital and core currencies, in order to build economic sovereignty and mitigate unequal exchange.  Note that Amin was <em>not</em> calling for autarky or isolation; on the contrary, he actively encouraged South-South cooperation and trade as a tactic for overcoming imperial dependencies. </p><p>2) <strong>Delink from the capitalist law of value</strong>. Under capitalism, production is organised around whatever is most profitable to capital (largely, foreign capital). In the </p>...</source>
