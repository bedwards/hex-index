        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions &#039;Overcoming the Ressentiment Complex&#039; as a lecture topic. Ressentiment is a key philosophical concept from Nietzsche&#039;s moral philosophy, referring to a particular form of reactive, self-poisoning resentment that Nietzsche saw as foundational to slave morality. Understanding this technical term is essential for grasping Nietzsche&#039;s critique of morality.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Newton is listed as one of three case studies in the lecture on &#039;Nietzsche within the Left.&#039; The co-founder of the Black Panther Party engaging with Nietzsche&#039;s philosophy represents a fascinating and lesser-known intersection of revolutionary politics and continental philosophy that readers would benefit from exploring.</p>

        <p>First, let me say thank you to all of the subscribers to this Substack. As you might have gathered I am a public educator in philosophy. Through my study groups, public symposium, seminars and interviews I commit most of my time, aside from my work in media, to teaching. There is a great freedom and burden that comes with teaching adjacent to the university. I teach as an adjunct philosophy instructor periodically at George Washington in DC as a ‘professorial lecturer’ and more recently I have been teaching online courses at para-academic institutions such as the School for Materialist Research, the Global Center for Advanced Studies and I have been invited to offer a course with the New Centre for Research and Practice. </p><p>I take the task of teaching very seriously and pour everything into it when I prepare a lecture and seminar. I’m actually grateful that I can teach with these institutions because of the freedom it offers to me. However, the burden of teaching publicly is that it is very difficult to garner financial support. At the same time, due to the crisis of higher education, I have a strict egalitarian policy to make most all of my study groups, interviews and symposiums completely free. I only ask that people subscribe to either my Substack of Patreon to support all of this work. But in reality, this generates a very small and modest amount on a monthly basis. </p><p>Over the last year and a half since <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154431861-how-to-read-like-a-parasite#CommunityReviews">my book on Nietzsche’s politics and his role within the left</a> has come out, it has created quite a stir. The <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE03jn2k3GYA-ccXswCLySpFbJIerNVa2&amp;si=ULJwR5uzTEgRgZ2i">discussions around the book</a> have been fabulous and what I love most are the discussions with Nietzscheans who have an openness to the critical perspective that I bring forth. This is why I am happy to invite you to sign up to gain access to four lectures I recently offered with the School of Materialist Research for a course entitled “<strong>Nietzsche’s Theoretical Surplus and Marxism in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.”</strong></p><h3><strong>How to sign up:</strong> </h3><p>The cost for accessing these four lectures is sliding scale $45 - $65 and once you purchase them I will send you the lectures, the readings and invite you to a Zoom debrief where you can raise any questions that come up for you.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </p><p>You can purchase this course, which includes a link to the ...</p>
