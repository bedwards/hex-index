It was borne from a feeling of restlessness, and a desire to do something new. I think the fraught loneliness of the pandemic had lots of us feeling a need to draw our people closer somehow. I wanted to forge new connections and community amongst those of us who love the unique power and beauty of the flash form. <strong>Also, by then I’d been writing and teaching flash for twenty years and I had some things to say about it! </strong></p><blockquote><p><em>To date, I’ve published 223 newsletters, I’ve reached well over 10,000 subscribers, and The Art of Flash has become a longtime Top 10 Fiction Bestseller here on Substack (thank you!).

Your 3 classes really awakened in me a kind of confidence in what I already know and how much there is still to learn.”</em></p><p><strong>Joan Didion famously said, </strong><em><strong>“I don’t know what I think until I write it down.”</strong></em><strong> </strong>This has been my experience, too. Writing these weekly posts has become a meditative practice for me. It’s forced me to get clear about what I believe flash is and is not, what I </p>...</source>
