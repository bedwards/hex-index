        <p><em>Sometimes I reserve Fridays for thought pieces. This doesn’t include the typical evidence-based information, but rather my reflections as I navigate this magnetic storm and try to find a North Star. </em></p><div><hr></div><p>This week, I was surrounded by more than 11,000 people who have dedicated their lives to keeping communities healthy at the country’s largest public health conference. It’s been a brutal year for public health. Budget cuts, lost jobs, lost research, visionary leaders gone from the federal government, and a deliberate attempt to traumatize and demoralize the entire workforce. Add the nonstop political crossfire, and it’s easy to see why so many in this field are running on fumes.</p><p>Being together again felt like a deep breath and was, quite frankly, therapeutic. You could feel this question hanging in the air: <em>How do we save public health? </em>That defense is essential. We can’t let decades of progress unravel.</p><p>But I couldn’t help but notice something desperately missing that is equally important: an offense.</p><h3><strong>What offense looks like</strong></h3><p>Offense is not fighting for what was broken, but fighting to create something better. In other words, loudly <strong>refusing to accept the old normal</strong>. </p><p>If we’re being honest, truly honest with ourselves, many systems were built for a different time. They haven’t kept pace with what Americans need today. For example, there is no reason a measly Texas epidemiologist should have to start a YLE newsletter in the middle of the biggest emergency we’ve ever faced. But scientific communication was one of the pandemic’s most significant shortcomings: the lack of timely, precise, nuanced, and actionable information for the public. Communication that acknowledged uncertainty, trade-offs, and the intelligence of the people. Offense is finding a gap, being responsive to the needs on the ground, and figuring out a solution.</p><p>Finding new ways to meet people where they are—on their phones, in their neighborhoods, in real conversations—not expecting them to read an 80-page PDF buried on a government website. But through participatory, co-developed, co-imagined solutions. </p><p>It requires courage to lean in, to move with hope, and to be okay with being wrong, yet willing to experiment. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg" width="990" height="518" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:518,&quot;width&quot;:990,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tyPr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4255503c-e807-4a79-a384-e251a1f12b7f_990x518.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Slide by Your Local Epidemiologist</figcaption></figure></div><p>Budgets are tight.
