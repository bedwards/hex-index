      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>I recently saw yet another progressive with a huge platform say that Trump’s ongoing horror show is proof that we all should have done more to get out the vote for Kamala Harris. This kind of historical amnesia, whether it’s the result of intentional manipulation or panicked myopia, makes me sick to my stomach. I want to take a moment to explain why.</p><p>We cannot argue for the lesser of two evils if the difference between those two evils is not enough for survival. If the difference between two choices is not enough to make the difference between life and death, we all have the responsibility to denounce both choices and create other options.</p><p>If Republicans under Trump devise new ways to terrify immigrants and weaken meager protections against deportations, but <a href="https://tracreports.org/reports/756/">the Democrats still manage to deport more people</a>, the ethical and strategic response is to fight against both parties and the entire system they represent.</p><p>Greenhouse gas emissions are shooting past tipping points <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/inflation-reduction-act-green-energy-carbon-emissions-broken-climate-framework">whether it’s the Right or the Left</a> in power, such that an increasing number of <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-warn-1-billion-people-on-track-to-die-from-climate-change">scientists are finally admitting</a> what anarchists and other radicals have been warning for a long time: that in the next few decades there is a very real danger of billions of humans dying<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> amidst a mass extinction event that could wipe out over half the species on the planet. In this situation, anyone who frames capitalism as a lesser evil that can be made sustainable is either harmfully ignorant of what’s actually going on or they have a psychopathic ability to barter unimaginable suffering for short-term profit.</p><p>And then there’s the question of ongoing genocide. I wish we could put a spotlight on these progressives and ask them, <em>is genocide not a red line for you? Do you honestly believe that the political Left, in either North America or Europe, when in power, has not enabled or supported Israel’s genocide against Palestinians?</em></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp" width="900" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:93728,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pro-Israel protest with a sea of US and Israeli flags&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://petergelderloos.substack.com/i/164605861?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Pro-Israel protest with a sea of US and Israeli flags" title="Pro-Israel protest with a sea of US and Israeli flags" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9O_n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85758a77-ce9e-4135-8160-4b99f7e9e02b_900x600.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Photo by Jae C Hong</figcaption></figure></div><p>Obviously, the US, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany all directly arm, supply, and militarily participate in the genocide. The antisemitic government of Hungary gives a great deal of political support to Israel, while Netanyahu helps cover up Orbán’s antisemitism, and the anti-Roma, anti-antifascist government of Germany shows they in fact have learned nothing from the Holocaust and give their own big, self-serving stamp of approval to Israel’s continuous war crimes.</p><p>The </p>...</source>
