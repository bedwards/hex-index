It’s not only because I live at the beach, but it’s the warmth I’m chasing. I love to sit in the sun and bake. I truly feel like the sun is like a cozy hug. Does everyone feel this way? I’m genuinely curious if anyone likes the feeling of being cold. Please let me know. </p><p>As I desperately hang on to summer, I'll be focusing on eating summer produce exclusives over the next couple of weeks. </p><p>Maybe you are hosting over Labor Day weekend or just want to try something new. These are the salads that define summer for me. </p><p>`1. <a href="https://www.ediblela.com/news/honeydew-feta-jalapenos-and-lime-salad">Honeydew, Jalapenos, and Lime</a> - <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jess Damuck&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:13859569,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47fc05f1-dd8a-484d-9513-9a2f6aa0a105_2755x3444.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;fa3a77da-3af1-4d9e-a87f-65a352e669c2&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> </p><p>I wrote about this eye-opening salad last year because the flavor combination was so special I’ll never forget it. I had never thought to eat raw jalapenos, but this salad empowered me to do so.  Please make this salad!! It feels fun and mature at the same time. </p><ol start="2"><li><p><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/watermelon-feta-mint-salad-recipe">Watermelon, Feta, and Mint Salad</a></p></li></ol><p>This was a salad I loved to make before I had any real interest in food and cooking. It makes no sense to eat in the winter, so please make one asap. I like mine with arugula and a touch of balsamic vinegar, but this recipe from Serious Eats is so thoughtful and detailed, I’m including it. Don’t skip out on the mint, it works so beautifully together. </p><ol start="3"><li><p><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1024075-dumpling-tomato-salad-with-chile-crisp-vinaigrette">Tomato Dumpling Salad w/ Chile Crisp Vinaigrette</a> - <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Hetty Lui McKinnon&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:27254765,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5c3ed1e8-c178-4221-ab83-b96e2473c6d3_836x836.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;6f1bde56-7ff8-4f90-ae00-b8a92b183461&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> </p></li></ol><p>Last year, this salad became a viral sensation. I am pretty sure I even heard Hetty herself say she was surprised at how popular it became. A reminder that the people want simple recipes! The key to this salad is good tomatoes, so take that trip to the farmers market beforehand. I love the chile crisp vinaigrette idea, and frozen dumplings are always handy to have in the freezer. Look out for the brand <a href="https://mimichengs.com/">Mimi Cheng’s</a> in the grocery store and at <a href="https://farmtopeople.com/producers/mimi-chengs?srsltid=AfmBOoq_BE5lc2Cb5uCZyVp5qT6cHb3khxJHhuey3JyAdSNKJvnRUHTD">Farm to People. </a> One of the founders was part of our <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3UR9BJtSfloJfHrTepF5hU">Know Your Food series</a> on scaling a restaurant and CPG brand. </p><p><em>To note: As with all produce, but ESPECIALLY summer produce, the better the quality, the better the dish. If you have any ways of getting a melon and tomatoes from the farmers market, it’s worth the extra stop or order from Farm to People. </em></p><div><hr></div><h3>Gems of the Week ✨</h3><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cbf56198-d68d-4b14-91de-7afbd2be45a9_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3546d123-d0eb-4a80-bbee-c4e36188475e_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/97e8fa39-7367-493a-beda-322c8070d0fe_1456x720.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><ul><li><p>I made roasted tomato and shallot </p></li>...</ul>
