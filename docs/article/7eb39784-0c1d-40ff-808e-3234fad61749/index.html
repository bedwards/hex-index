        <p class="topic-summary">The Xinhua commentary&#039;s reference to &#039;a defeat more thorough than that of 80 years ago&#039; directly invokes Japan&#039;s defeat in WWII and the preceding Sino-Japanese War. Understanding this conflict provides essential historical context for why China-Japan relations remain so fraught and why historical grievances are weaponized in modern diplomatic disputes.</p>
