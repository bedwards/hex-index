          <strong>Regulatory capture</strong>
          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article explicitly discusses regulatory capture as a key mechanism through which economic elites influence political systems. Understanding this concept deeply—its history, examples, and theoretical frameworks—would help readers grasp the mechanics of how political capitalism operates.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references Olson&#039;s theory about small elite groups having advantages in organizing for collective action. His work on collective action problems and institutional economics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding why economic elites successfully collude with political power.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses the intertwining of economic and political elites in fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Corporatism as a political-economic system—distinct from modern corporate power—provides historical context for understanding earlier forms of political capitalism and how state-business relations were formally structured.</p>
