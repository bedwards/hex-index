Witkoff, a billionaire with no previous diplomatic experience, is in charge of mediating an extraordinarily complex international conflict, a role that requires him to be trusted by both Russia and Ukraine as an honest broker.</p><p>An investigation by Popular Information reveals that, while serving in this role, Witkoff has maintained an active financial partnership with Len Blavatnik, a billionaire with ties to Russia who has been sanctioned by Ukraine. Witkoff and Blavatnik are co-developing a massive residential real estate project in New York City. The relationship raises additional questions about the nature of Witkoff’s role.</p><p>A transcript of an October 14 phone call <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-advised-russia-on-how-to-pitch-ukraine-plan-to-trump">leaked</a> last week to Bloomberg News revealed that Witkoff has been coaching his Russian counterpart, Yuri Ushakov, and advising him on how to undermine an upcoming call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p><p>Witkoff advised Ushakov, the top foreign policy advisor of Russian President Vladimir Putin, that Putin should call Trump quickly, before a scheduled meeting with Zelenskyy. During the call, Witkoff recommended Putin “congratulate the president” on the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, and praise Trump as “a man of peace.” That phone call took place on <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/16/trump-putin-call-zelensky-meeting">October 16</a> and appeared to have the desired impact. In a “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/16/trump-putin-call-zelensky-meeting">tense</a>“ meeting with Zelenskyy the following day, Trump rejected Ukrainian requests for Tomahawk missiles.</p><p>Further, in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript">leaked October 14 call</a>, Witkoff appears to suggest that he partner with Russia to create the “Trump plan” to end the war in Ukraine. “We put a 20-point Trump plan together [for Gaza] that was 20 points for peace and I’m thinking maybe we do the same thing with you,” Witkoff said. “Maybe [Putin] says to President Trump: you know, Steve and Yuri discussed a very similar 20-point plan to peace and that could be something that we think might move the needle a little bit.”</p><p>On <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/europe/peace-proposal-russia-ukraine-annotated-intl-vis">October 20</a>, the United States produced a 28-point “Trump plan” which required Ukraine to cede significant territory to </p>...</source>
