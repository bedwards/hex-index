        <p>I don’t remember how we came to run this piece in <em>Context</em>, although this was an issue (the 11th), for which I was an associate editor, and the lead article is “Reading William Carlos Williams” by Linda Wagner-Martin, which I remember getting and nervously working on.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> I suspect this originated with Curtis White, <em>Context</em>’s editor from the jump, and this has all the markings of a Curtis-heavy issue with “Commentaries” by Reg Gibbons, Mary E. Papke, Thomas Frank, and Lindsay Waters. </p><p>That said, I was reading a lot of authors at the time that Giles Gordon was connected to, especially B. S. Johnson, Ann Quin, and, the subject of our next <a href="https://dalkeyarchive.substack.com/podcast">Mining the Dalkey Archive podcast</a>, Brigid Brophy.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> Gordon, an innovative novelist in his own right, also ran the Scottish branch of the Curtis Brown Agency, and represented a number of the members of this branch of boundary-pushing British writers from the latter half of the twentieth century.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> And since this was around the time that we were doing Quin and Brophy, Gordon’s presence—as an agent and a writer—was in the air.</p><p>The piece below is, for a lot of Dalkey aficionados, pretty basic, yet a nice starting point to discuss ways to approach and converse about literature, and what sets certain books apart. This is a thread that runs throughout the “Commentaries” in <em>Context</em>, so expect more of them in the coming months. For now, enjoy!</p><div><hr></div><h4><strong>“Fiction As Itself” by Giles Gordon</strong></h4><p>The difficulty with writing, as with reading, is words. Only the painter uses paint—not the spectator, not even the art critic; he uses words. Only the composer uses notes—not the listener, nor the music critic; he too uses words. The writer uses words, but so does everybody else. Therefore everyone believes he or she is a potential writer.</p><p>Most people, in daily currency, use words in what they think of as a fairly literal way. Consequently they are made uneasy if a writer does not use them similarly. They expect a novelist to know more words than they do, and to employ them with greater expertise than they can. Basically though, they expect a “story” to begin at the beginning (wherever that may be). If the first four words aren’t literally “Once upon a time,” the reader should be able to assume they’re taken for granted. The story should continue ...</p>
