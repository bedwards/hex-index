Vance dismissed the poor showing by Republicans on Tuesday night as “<a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1986099131845136594">a couple of elections in blue states</a>.” Although Democratic victories in New York, Virginia, New Jersey, and California dominated the headlines, significant contests were held across the nation.</p><p>In purple states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, and deep red states like Texas and Mississippi, voters rejected the MAGA agenda. Here are six results from the 2025 elections that flew under the radar.</p><h3><strong>Pennsylvania county ousts sheriff who collaborated with ICE</strong></h3><p>In Bucks County — Pennsylvania’s largest swing county, which Trump <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/donald-trump-bucks-county-pennsylvania-election/">narrowly won</a> in 2024 — Democrat Danny Ceisler was elected county sheriff after the Republican incumbent signed a deal to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) earlier this year.</p><p>In April, Republican Fred Harran signed his deputies up for a <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/ice-bucks-county-sheriff-immigrant-rights/">287(g) program</a> with ICE, which allows local law enforcement to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations and perform other duties typically reserved for federal immigration enforcement officers.</p><p>Ceisler, who defeated Harran with more than 55% of the vote, described the ICE agreement as “<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/elections-2025-pennsylvania-bucks-county-sheriff/">the big issue in this race</a>.” Ceisler promised to suspend the agreement immediately after taking office and said that restoring trust with immigrants in the county was a top priority.</p><h3><strong>Progressives win control of Texas school board that censored books</strong></h3><p>In Texas’s Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District (CFISD), which is the third largest in the state, progressive candidates won all three open board seats, giving them a <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/education/2025/11/04/534968/cy-fair-isd-election-results-school-board-conservative-policies/">4-3 majority</a>. Since 2023, the board has been controlled by a 6-1 conservative supermajority, which has enacted a range of far-right policies.</p><p>In the past two years, the CFISD board has <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/education/article/cyfair-isd-science-textbook-changes-politics-19509057.php">removed textbook chapters</a> on climate change, vaccines, Covid-19, and diversity; fired over half of CFISD librarians, leading to school library <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/education-news/2024/09/11/499594/cy-fair-isds-libraries-are-frequently-closed-after-trustees-cut-librarian-positions-in-half/">closures</a>; restricted school library content; and created elective <a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/education/2024/08/13/496540/cy-fair-district-board-of-trustees-voted-unanimously-to-approve-bible-focused-elective-courses-for-2025-26-school-year/">courses about the Bible</a>.</p><p>One of the members who lost her seat, Natalie Blasingame, first ran for the CFISD board in 2015. At the time, she wrote in an <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/cy-fair-isd-board-christian-right/">email to donors</a>, “The Lord put on my heart that my agenda is to tear down the over-interpretation of the separation of church and state that has shut God out of schools.”</p><h3><strong>Georgia elects its first Democrat to a non-federal statewide office since 2006</strong></h3><p>Two Georgia Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, won election to the state’s Public Service </p>...</source>
