        <p><em>Welcome to “Supply Chain in Numbers.” This newsletter tracks significant numbers from the supply chain world. Five prominent numbers are published every Monday. If you have any feedback, please send it to m</em>e.</p><h3>31% of shoppers expect same day delivery</h3><p>Nearly one in three U.S. consumers now expect same-day delivery, according to Ryder’s 2025 E-commerce Consumer Study. The finding highlights how quickly shopper expectations are shifting and how much pressure this puts on supply chains already balancing speed, cost, and sustainability. The study, which surveyed 1,000 U.S. online shoppers, found that 31% now consider same-day delivery standard, up sharply from prior years when two-day shipping was the gold standard. At the same time, 63% expect delivery in two days or less, showing how fast fulfillment is becoming a baseline requirement. The study also revealed that consumer loyalty is increasingly fragile. Eighty-four percent of shoppers said they would switch retailers if expectations aren’t met, and 74% said a poor returns experience would stop them from buying from a brand again.

In 2023, there were 55,000 light, medium and heavy electric trucks sold worldwide. With 40,000 of these trucks, China accounted for 73 percent of the market. Last year, Chinese automakers accounted for 80 percent of the 90,000 electric cargo trucks sold. Within China, electric trucks accounted for 22 percent of the heavy-duty market in the first half of the year, compared to just one percent in Europe.
