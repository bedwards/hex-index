As the secretary gave me the dime tour, I met a bunch of guys I’d never see again, whose pending retirements made this move possible in the first place. As I extended a hand to one guy, he warned me not to get to know him too much. He was a nice guy, he said, but he wouldn’t be there much longer. He had retirement in sight and even kept a handwritten countdown taped inside his locker.</p><p>That countdown became a running inside joke between us, with me betting him a gift card that I’d retire first. Ten years later, he and his wife enjoyed a trip to Texas Roadhouse on my dime. Life’s funny that way. </p><p>I’m now in the spot he was in (sorta). If all goes to plan, I have a little over two years left—689 days as of this writing. That’s aspirational more than anything, and just as hard to fathom as the idea that that July day was almost 27 years ago. This date also lines up with a few other life events: a milestone service anniversary (God, I’m old) and my youngest graduating (how did we get here?!). His countdown is 523 days, or roughly a year and a half. It might as well be 2057, as abstract as it seems. It all feels right around the corner and a lifetime away. Both are true.</p><p>My calendar tells me that a year and a half ago, I was lucky enough to finally see The Church and Afghan Whigs play. My mind tells me it’s been a decade. Around that same time, that same kid was playing in one of his first rugby tournaments.</p><p>The strangest thing about being middle-aged is how squishy time has become. I used to roll my eyes when people said it only gets faster. Turns out they were right. Why that guy told me he’d be gone soon makes sense now, too. Eighteen months? Twenty-four? Those will be here next weekend—or feel like it anyway. Eighteen months ago, on the other hand, might as well have been 1992 in my mind’s eye.</p><p>My point here is this: 2025 felt like it would take forever, and as hard as it fought to prove us right, it was gone before we knew it.</p><p>I have no idea what will happen </p>...</source>
