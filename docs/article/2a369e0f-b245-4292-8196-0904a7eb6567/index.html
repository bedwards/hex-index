        <p><em>Zilan Qian is a programme associate at the Oxford China Policy Lab and holds a Master’s degree in Social Science of the Internet from the University of Oxford.</em></p><p><strong>The dominant narrative about China’s AI race frames it as a government-backed sprint toward AGI capabilities, competing head-to-head with the US frontier. But examining more than 6000 records of generative AI models filed through China’s registry system (updated through November 2025) tells a different story.</strong></p><p>Since 2023, all public-facing AI models must be filed with regulators before launch — creating an unprecedented window into China’s actual ecosystem. China’s AI registry system creates multiple datasets organized by service type and regulatory concern: internet information service algorithm (IISA), deep synthesis algorithms (DSA), and generative AI services (also known as AIGC, AI-generated content). This article draws on AIGC and DSA datasets — the ones capturing generative AI development — while leaving aside IISA data, which focuses on non-generative technology like recommendation algorithms.</p><p>In this piece, I focus on quantitatively analyzing the records in the registry system, which challenges the “AI race” narrative where China as a whole is tightly united under central government guidance. <strong>Instead, the analysis will show that: </strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Private companies, rather than the state, drive development</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Frontier developers are pursuing specialized models rather than converging on a single path for scaling LLMs</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Geographic concentration reveals local governments actively shaping innovation clusters through fiscal competition.</strong></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>For a comprehensive look at the development of China’s AI regulations into a formal registry system, I have prepared <a href="https://ocpl.substack.com/p/172affb0-9a50-4007-99ac-4953a82e99ee">a full explainer</a>. </strong>This analysis covers the system’s key focus areas, the types of AI content regulators seek to censor, and the processes used for conducting broad security assessments of AI services. I believe this explainer offers valuable insights for China watchers, as well as AI governance and safety researchers, by detailing the strengths and weaknesses of China’s approach to AI registration.</em></p><h2>Understanding the Data</h2><p>The <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yxyZzLFbmQKIPonzyMH8m62IE78egBy0zCiL7ZXqxXM/edit?usp=sharing">AIGC dataset</a></strong> tracks all new public-facing AI models developed in China, showing who is building what, where, and when. It captures two types of activity: <strong>models being developed</strong> (training from scratch or fine-tuning open source models) and <strong>models being deployed</strong> (using APIs of China’s models or locally installed open source models without modification). Together, these reveal both the landscape of model development and how quickly models reach actual users.</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VMqe0kAuHFmB-zslqIORXzGaKaO_0GqHxRSDj6SFnCE/edit?usp=sharing">DSA dataset</a></strong> captures the specific algorithmic services for the public that are built ...</p>
