        <p class="topic-summary">The article highlights Denver&#039;s Tierra Colectiva as an example of community-led development. Understanding the legal and organizational structure of community land trusts—how they separate land ownership from building ownership to maintain permanent affordability—provides essential context for appreciating why this model represents a departure from conventional development.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">San Francisco&#039;s lawsuit against food corporations centers on ultraprocessed products and their public health costs. The NOVA food classification system, the scientific debate around what makes these foods harmful, and the epidemiological research linking them to chronic disease would give readers the scientific foundation to understand the legal claims.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses transport politics on Bogotá&#039;s Seventh Avenue and transport justice. TransMilenio, Bogotá&#039;s pioneering bus rapid transit system, is central to the city&#039;s transport history and the political conflicts around public transit infrastructure that the referenced research examines.</p>
