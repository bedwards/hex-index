        <a href="../../wikipedia/alain-badiou/index.html">
          <strong>Alain Badiou</strong>
          <span class="read-time">16 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article directly references Badiou&#039;s &#039;True Life&#039; and his claim about philosophy corrupting the youth. Understanding Badiou&#039;s broader philosophical project—his ontology based on set theory, his theory of the Event, and his radical leftist politics—would deeply enrich the reader&#039;s understanding of the argument being made.</p>

          <strong>Socratic method</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the &#039;Socratic revolution&#039; and the technique of endless questioning (&#039;What, exactly, do you mean by...?&#039;). A deeper understanding of the elenctic method, its historical context in Athens, and its role in Western philosophy would provide essential background for the article&#039;s core argument about thinking.</p>

          <strong>Air India Flight 171</strong>
          <span class="read-time">14 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article uses this specific aviation disaster as its central illustrative example of the limits of digital systems versus human thinking. Understanding the full technical investigation and the fly-by-wire system failures would illuminate the philosophical point about machine cognition versus human judgment.</p>
