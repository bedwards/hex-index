I remember getting one of those piggy banks as a present around the age of ten and thought it was probably the dullest thing I had received all year. 😜</p><p>However, when I look back on that event, it’s the first time the habit of saving money was inculcated in me, making it one of the most important lessons I have learnt.&nbsp;<strong>In a minimalistic way of sorts, that’s the first step I had taken towards Financial Planning</strong>.

This results in forcing us to make a choice of letting go of one need to have the other&nbsp;<em>(technically known as the Opportunity Cost)</em>.</p><p>For example: If you have recently lost your job due to the Pandemic and face the probability of not finding another one in the next few months, you will get into the process of making lifestyle </p>...</source>
