        <p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/jonathan-a-czin/">Jon Czin</a> of Brookings spent years as a top China analyst at the CIA and served as China Director on Biden’s NSC. He <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/chinatalk/p/xi-pla-purges-and-us-china?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">returns</a> to ChinaTalk to review 2025 and forecast 2026. [<em>Recorded before the latest round of purges…see the feed later today for an emergency pod we’re recording together this afternoon</em>]</p><p>We discuss:</p><ul><li><p>Why 2025 has become “the year of living quietly” in US-China relations.</p></li><li><p>Trump as “his own China desk officer”: personality, personnel churn, deal psychology, and legacy-thinking.</p></li><li><p>China’s “escalate to de-escalate” strategy: rare earth leverage, midterm timing, and a shift from defense to offense that traps Washington in a game of whack-a-mole.</p></li><li><p>The “mosh pit” inside the Trump administration: competing factions, ideas that break through by accident, and the absence of a sustained China strategy.</p></li><li><p>Why Venezuela, Iran, and covert drama don’t move the needle with Beijing and why the real stakes are in alliances, especially with Japan.</p></li><li><p>Chaos Muppets and Double Sixes: a generational theory of why Bush, Clinton, and Trump all embrace(d) chaos, and whether Trump’s incredible streak of luck on high-risk gambles is finally about to run out.</p></li></ul><h2>The Strange Calm in US-China Relations</h2><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> Jon Czin of Brookings, formerly with the IC and Biden’s NSC, returns for our quarterly check-in on US-China relations. It’s been unnervingly quiet, hasn’t it? The rest of the world isn’t quiet — we’re abducting folks and bombing Iran next week — but the US-China front is very placid.</p><p><strong>Jon Czin: </strong>Surprisingly so. That isn’t what I expected. I assumed that whatever accord we reached back in November, when the two presidents met, would have generated some “stray voltage” by now. As we rounded the corner to the holidays, I was ready to add a meeting between Scott Bessent and He Lifeng in some European capital to my Advent calendar.</p><p>Instead, we are in this strange moment. With everything happening globally and domestically, it feels like the beginning of a Western movie where they say, “It’s quiet... too quiet.” As a parent of young children, I fear the silence more than the noise. It forces you to ask: Is something dangerous happening beneath the surface? I don’t believe that’s the case, but this is a rare, fallow moment in the bilateral relationship. It’s a good time to analyze how we got here and where we might be going.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong> Let’s diagnose this. In the early ...</p>
