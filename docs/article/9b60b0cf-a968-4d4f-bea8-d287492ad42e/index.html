        <p>Hello All,</p><p>The big story this week is not hard to pinpoint. The US Government under the rule of Donald Trump is more and more openly operating as an ally/agent/protector of Vladimir Putin’s dictatorial rule in Russia. Trump even employs and trusts someone who at this point could be called an active Russian agent of influence. And for months, it seems, the US government, under Trump, has been working on a plan to sell Ukraine to Russia in exchange for personal benefit for the president’s inner circle. Soon, a US delegation will be arriving in Moscow, perhaps to complete the deal.</p><p>Considering such developments, how can this be called “not a bad” week for Ukraine. Well, it starts with one simple word—truth. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/29/the-week-europe-realised-it-stands-alone-against-russian-expansionism">While people, particularly in Europe, might be shocked at what has happened this week, and there was a good </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/29/the-week-europe-realised-it-stands-alone-against-russian-expansionism">Guardian</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/29/the-week-europe-realised-it-stands-alone-against-russian-expansionism"> article about that realization</a>, they should not have been. The truth is and was that this was always in the cards. This was always Trump’s plan and from the moment he was elected to his second term (now more than a year ago) Europeans needed to understand that they were on their own. They needed to prepare to support Ukraine on their own, to stop deferring to the USA, to prepare the continent greater for strategic autonomy and self-defense.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg" width="1080" height="810" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:810,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M6xE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb10734c-aecf-4662-baeb-930c6846dfdd_1080x810.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption"><a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/4030903-yermak-holds-talks-with-witkoff-in-new-york.html">Andriy Yermak (centre left) and Steve Witkoff (right) meeting in August. </a>That Yermak has resigned and Witkoff has not tells us a great deal about what happened this week.</figcaption></figure></div><p>That they did not can be the subject for recriminations at another time. Now the truth seems to be realized, and that alone makes it a good week for Ukraine and the rest of Europe. And that is not the only reason. It was also a good week for democracy and Ukraine, with real developments that show the Ukrainian government is operating under the rule of law (unlike some other governments it must be said). </p><p>So all in all not a bad week. I am not saying that to be portray optimism or that this will all end well. That the US Government is being run as a criminal enterprise is perhaps the most dangerous development of my life. However it is better to grasp that reality than pretend otherwise.</p><h4><strong>Truth</strong></h4><p>This week saw the last gasp of the hope that Trump might do the right thing that has </p>...</source>
