        <p>Friends,</p><p>The most dangerous corporation in America is one you may not have heard of.</p><p>It’s called Palantir Technologies, a Silicon Valley tech company that may put your most basic freedoms at risk.</p><p>Palantir gets its name from a device used in Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings, </em>in which a “palantir” is a seeing stone — something like a crystal ball — that can be used to spy on people and distort the truth. During the War of the Ring, a palantir falls under the control of the evil Sauron, who uses it to manipulate and deceive.</p><p>Palantir — co-founded by far-right billionaire Peter Thiel and its current CEO Alex Karp — bears a striking similarity.</p><p>It sells AI-based data platforms that let their clients, including governments, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/#:~:text=Foundry%20and%20Gotham,not%20provide%20any.">militaries, and law enforcement agencies</a>, quickly process and analyze massive amounts of your personal data.</p><p>Whether it’s <a href="https://theconversation.com/when-the-government-can-see-everything-how-one-company-palantir-is-mapping-the-nations-data-263178#:~:text=The%20stakes%20are,intelligence%20and%20surveillance.">social media</a> profiles, <a href="https://www.palantir.com/impact/transaction-monitoring/">bank account</a> records, tax history, medical history, or driving records, the tools that Palantir sells are used to help clients identify and monitor individuals — like you.</p><p>Why should this matter to you? Billions of your <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/14/palantir-ai-charts-revenue.html#:~:text=to%20megacap%20peers.-,Government%20money,-Government%20contracts%20have">tax dollars</a> are going to Palantir, and what Palantir is working on could be used against you.</p><p>As Palantir’s Karp says: “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them.”</p><p>Early in his current term, Trump signed an executive order requiring government agencies to consolidate all of their information about you into one giant database — something that has never been done before. To help process this massive amount of information, Trump chose Palantir.</p><p>Trump claims this is about “efficiency.” But as one Silicon Valley investor described it, Palantir is <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1913338841068404903">“building the infrastructure of the police state.”</a></p><p>D<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/06/dangers-consolidating-all-government-information#:~:text=The%20consolidation%20of,it%20was%20collected.">ata privacy experts</a> warn that when government data is pooled together, it can be used by a tyrant to intimidate or silence opposition. The possibilities for abuse are huge. One of Palantir’s major projects is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/">a new immigrant surveillance system for ICE</a>’s deportations.</p><p>We’ve already seen Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/02/nx-s1-5345777/trump-states-fema-funds">target</a> people or organizations he considers enemies. Imagine if he  could punish or deny services to individual Americans based on their political affiliation,  whether they’ve attended a protest, or even posted an unflattering picture of him online.</p><p>Palantir could be giving Trump the power to do just this.</p><p>Palantir ...</p>
