It takes the reader from a NATO-occupied bridge in Mitrovica to the most beautiful parking lot in Kaçanik, from the Kosovo Serb enclave of Štrpce to Pristina’s Old Jewish Cemetery.

I gathered that describing the plot of Inflammation would not lead to any edifying exchanges, so instead I said, “If I could sum that up in a sentence then I wouldn’t need to write novels.”</p><p>“Very good,” she said.</p><p>“Thanks,” I said.
