        <h4>Hushed and lulled</h4><p>From the first word of the comprehensive new <em>Poems of Seamus Heaney</em>, Heaney writes in a familiar voice. </p><blockquote><p>Hushed<br>And lulled<br>Lay the field, under a high-sky sun.</p></blockquote><p>Hushed and lulled could have been the title of this volume. Heaney’s voice often is hushed and lulled, both his writing and his reading voice. There is much “hushed and lulled” imagery in<em> Death of a Naturalist</em>: “The squat pen rests, snug as a gun”, “Hunched over the railing”, “Snug on our bellies”, “Drifted through the dark of banks and hatches”. This hushed hunching is found in the earliest uncollected poems, but also in some of Heaney’s later work, such as <em>Seeing Things</em>: “Hunkerings, tensings, pressures of the thumb”, “that sniffed-at, bleated-into grassy space”, “Firelit, shuttered, slated, and stone-walled”, “claustrophobic, nest-up-in-the-roof/Effect”, “all hutch and hatch”. </p><p>This hutch-hatch snug-nested manner is the heart of Heaney’s forms as well as his tones. Like the poet who had the greatest-but-least-acknowledged influence on his work, Robert Frost, Heaney enjoys tightness—not the neat tightness of form in which Frost specialized, but the sort of tightness we associate with being hushed, slated, lulled, or stone-walled: his poems are packed, slotted, with meanings couching, crouching, bunching.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> </p><p>In the seventh Glanmore Sonnet, from <em>Field Work</em> (1979), Heaney embodies the “flux” of the sea in repetitions of sounds and cells of rhythm. See how the vowels bob and swirl, and the lines are packed with compoundings, condensings. </p><blockquote><p>Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Irish Sea:<br>Green, swift upsurges, North Atlantic flux<br>Conjured by that strong gale-warning voice,<br>Collapse into a sibilant penumbra.<br>Midnight and closedown. Sirens of the tundra,<br>Of eel-road, seal-road, keel-road, whale-road, raise<br>Their wind-compounded keen behind the baize<br>And drive the trawlers to the lee of Wicklow.<br><em>L’Etoile, Le Guillemot, La Belle Hélène<br></em>Nursed their bright names this morning in the bay<br>That toiled like mortar. It was marvellous<br>And actual, I said out loud, ‘A haven,’<br>The word deepening, clearing, like the sky<br>Elsewhere on Minches, Cromarty, The Faroes.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h4>Half guessing, half expression</h4><p>That poem leads us to the next of Heaney’s central qualities: “It was marvellous/ And actual.” In the early uncollected ‘Lines to Myself’, Heaney instructs: “You should attempt concrete pression/ Half guessing, half expression.” </p><p>This is notable: Heaney <em>wants</em> the persuasive pressure (“pression”) he puts on his concrete images to slip into something vaguer—half-guessing. </p><p>In this half-guessing pression, he follows ...</p>
