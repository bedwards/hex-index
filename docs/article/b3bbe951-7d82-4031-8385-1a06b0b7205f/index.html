        <h6>I count this as a failure nine different successive times. There really is a unique, well‑defined answer, and where the machine has every chance to uncover it: the Hedge Knight Ashford Meadow line‑up. This avoids the usual escape hatches about “the data might be ambiguous” or “this is a hard open question.” We get not one isolated “hallucination” but rather a <em>hallucination</em> <em>cascade</em>…</h6><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png" width="1456" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rP3I!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff31242ce-1e9b-4190-bed9-510694f80aff_3048x2010.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>As Noah Smith warns everyone: if you don’t like posts about “AI”—then stay off the internet for the next, I don’t know, five years or so. That applies here as well as anyone else.</p><p><strong>BE WARNED!!</strong></p><div><hr></div><p>Today’s MAMLM post is triggered by the extremely sharp John Quiggin’s: </p><blockquote><p><strong>John Quiggin</strong>; LLMs Reaching the Tipping Point &lt;<a href="https://johnquigginblog.substack.com/p/llms-reaching-the-tipping-point">https://johnquigginblog.substack.com/p/llms-reaching-the-tipping-point</a>&gt;: ‘[Before] Anthropic’s Claude Code late last year… there was a fair bit of disillusionment about “vibe coding” and… [its] buggy output… as well as… general disaffection… with… AI slop…. But lately, the tone has changed radically…. Even [the] previously sceptical… have concluded… Claude represent[s] the future…. OpenAI Deep Research… [has had] <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2025/04/30/not-so-deep-thoughts-about-deep-ai/">mixed</a> <a href="https://johnquiggin.com/2025/12/10/adventures-with-deep-research">results</a> until recently. But now I’m perceiving the same kind of change… lengthy interactions … as if I were talking to an intelligent and exceptionally well-informed human… keeps track… seems less prone to fabrications… [and] this kind of interaction is fun…. DR is moving from being an enthusiastic but unreliable research assistant to something more like a well-read junior co-author. The ideas are still mine, but I can rely on DR to provide discussion and critique as well as routine stuff like literature summaries…</p></blockquote><p>I confess I have not been doing enough coding this winter to gain a sense of any sea-change. But I will say that I am not seeing it in other realms—specifically, in ChatGPT and its ilk as an alternative to standard search engines. The advantages are (a) a natural-language interface, (b) a system that has not (yet) been turned fully up the wazoo to sell ads, plus (c ) the SEO spammers have not yet descended to—I really do not like the vibe of “en****tify”—full commodification cannibalization. Yet I found it could not o the job when, yesterday, I asked it for a list of the fighters-for-good in Episode 5 of HBO’s “A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms”. That ought to have been well within its capabilities.
