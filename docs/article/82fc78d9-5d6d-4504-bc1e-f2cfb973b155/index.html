        <h3>Where the hard edge of physics meets the vulnerable metaphysics of the human heart. </h3>
<hr>
<p>Few people have enchanted the popular imagination with science more powerfully and lastingly than physicist <strong>Richard Feynman</strong> (May 11, 1918–February 15, 1988) — the “Great Explainer” with the uncommon gift for bridging the essence of science with the most human and humane dimensions of life.</p>
<p>Several months after Feynman’s death, while working on what would become <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/genius-the-life-and-science-of-richard-feynman/oclc/25316182&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — the masterly biography plumbing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/11/richard-feynman-genius-james-gleick/">the wellspring of Feynman’s genius</a> — James Gleick discovered something of arresting strangeness and splendor. </p>
<p>“My heart stopped,” Gleick tells me. “I have never had an experience like that as a biographer, before or since.”</p>
<p>In a mass of unread papers sent to him by Feynman’s widow, Gweneth, Gleick found a letter that discomposed his most central understanding of Feynman’s character. A generation after computing pioneer Alan Turing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/">tussled with the binary code of body and spirit in the wake of loss</a>, Feynman — a scientist perhaps <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/">uncommonly romantic</a> yet resolutely rational and unsentimental in his reverence for the indomitable laws of physics that tend toward decay — penned a remarkable letter to a physical nonentity that was, for the future Nobel-winning physicist, the locus of an irrepressible metaphysical reality. </p>

<p>In high school, the teenage Richard spent summers at the beach in his native Far Rockaway. There, he grew besotted with a striking girl named Arline — a girl he knew he would marry. Both complement and counterpoint to his own nature, Arline met Richard’s inclination for science with ardor for philosophy and art. (The art class he took just to be near her would lay the foundation for his <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/17/richard-feynman-ofey-sketches-drawings/">little-known, lifelong passion for drawing</a>.) By his junior year, Richard proposed. Arline accepted. With the eyes of young love, they peered into a shared future of infinite possibility for bliss. </p>

<p>But they were abruptly grounded when a mysterious malady began afflicting Arline with inexplicable symptoms — a lump would appear and disappear on her neck, fevers would roil over her with no apparent cause. Eventually, she was hospitalized for what was believed to be typhoid. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feynman began to glimpse the special powerlessness that medical uncertainty can inflict on a scientific person. He had come to believe that the scientific way </p>...</blockquote>
