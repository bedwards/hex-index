        <p>Hi friends,</p><p>No, you’re not time travelling to next week, but yes, I’m back in your inbox/app again! Just yesterday, I sent out <a href="https://sarahbessey.substack.com/p/book-corner-sept2025">my quarterly book corner post, reviewing and sharing all the books that have been on my bedside table lately</a> but eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that there was one notable book missing from that stack. </p><p>Of course that wasn’t a mistake because <em>this</em> book needed more words than that one missive could contain. <strong>Truly, a sky-writer and a full manuscript wouldn’t be sufficient for my feelings about this particular book or its author. </strong></p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/99c513a5-299d-454a-a29c-c185bfbed11e_808x1024.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8164161c-ecf9-457c-aeb8-0482d06b578a_988x1500.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;staticGalleryImage&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/94a5538d-a27f-42ea-8de9-2240b56d397b_1456x720.png&quot;}},&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true}"></div><p><strong>That book is </strong><em><strong><a href="https://jenhatmaker.com/awake/">Awake: A Memoir</a></strong></em><strong> by <a href="https://jenhatmaker.com">Jen Hatmaker</a>. </strong>And today is the today it releases to the world.</p><p>Many of you know that <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jen Hatmaker&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:3048045,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/acafdf4f-01d7-4bfc-b899-29cf27486603_918x918.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;319be6ec-0127-456a-a99b-ce4e241de3fa&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span> has been one of my dearest friends for more than thirteen years now;

(L to R: yours truly, Sarah G., Tara, Jen, Jamie, and Kristen). This was taken the day after we dissected every word of an early draft of “Awake” with Jen late into the night. God, I can’t imagine life without these women.</figcaption></figure></div><p>There is not one part of our lives that has gone unexamined by one another. Over all these years, we have laughed until we’ve cried, we’ve prayed desperately - and we’ve had long seasons where few of us even <em>could</em> pray. We’ve gone to depths of grief that we never imagined it was possible to survive. We’ve talked about our kids and our careers and our marriages and our relationships and our friendships and our parents until any reasonable person would have passed out from it. We’ve each been about four different women apiece in those years. <strong>Our circle is one of the most sacred relationships of my life and I am utterly devoted to all of these women and their own awakenings.</strong> They are stuck with me for always.</p><p>Basically, I will have zero chill about this book or about Jen. </p><p>I know that many of you have already preordered the book or requested it from your library. Perhaps you are halfway through reading it right this blessed second and are preparing your review for an online retailer.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> There has been wall </p>...</source>
