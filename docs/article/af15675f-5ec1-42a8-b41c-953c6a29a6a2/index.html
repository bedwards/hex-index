        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the Epstein files release and coverup allegations. Understanding Epstein&#039;s full history—his financial career, social connections, the scope of his crimes, and the 2008 plea deal—provides essential context for why this document release is so politically charged.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article mentions Representatives considering charging DOJ officials with contempt of Congress.

But Attorney General Pam Bondi and company are sorely mistaken if they think giving Congress a middle finger is going to make the scandal go away.</p><p>The administration’s blatant defiance of statute is yet another ugly exercise in lawlessness by a fascist regime which attacks the Constitution on multiple fronts virtually every day. It makes a mockery of the pain of victims and survivors who Jeffrey Epstein assaulted and tortured when they were children. It’s not a surprise that Trump is disregarding the law, but that doesn’t make his decision to do so any less cruel or any less disgusting.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;c2f5a256-9046-48aa-a340-bfe59bf6fd9a&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;2025 was a political disaster for MAGA&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1081448,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Justin Glawe&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Independent journalist, author of American Doom covering chaos, corruption, conspiracies + threats to democracy.

It would be premature to argue that this will be different — and in fact it seems very unlikely that Trump will be impeached or removed for his association with a sexual abuser, just as it’s unlikely  he’ll face consequences for his own history of sexual impropriety and violence.</p><p>But that does not mean that Trump and his enablers in his party will face no consequences for this egregious, clumsy, and contemptuous coverup. </p><p>We already know that Trump’s stonewalling on Epstein has created major rifts in the MAGA coalition and has generated horrifically bad press for Trump even on the right. Those fissures are only going to metastasize as Trump tries to pretend he has fulfilled the law when he obviously has not. No one can know the future. But none of the plausible paths forward looks good for Trump or the Republican Party.</p><h3>Barely pretending</h3><p>The Epstein Files Transparency Act — passed, again, almost unanimously by both houses of Congress — is a short, uncomplicated measure. </p><p>It gives the attorney general 30 days to “make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format” all unclassified materials relating to federal investigations of Jeffrey Epstein in the government’s possession.
