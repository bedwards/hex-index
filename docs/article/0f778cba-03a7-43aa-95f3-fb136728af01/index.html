Glad you could join us.</p><p>Before we start, a quick note of thanks. Sunday’s issue about <em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-toy-story-you-remember">Toy Story</a></em><a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-toy-story-you-remember"> and film stock</a> was the most popular thing we’ve published here. Much of its traffic came from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45883788">Hacker News</a>, where it held the number-one spot for hours and passed 1,000 points within a day. Really grateful to everyone for the kind responses.</p><p>Now, though, we’re looking elsewhere in the animation world — to the country of Czechoslovakia, which no longer exists.</p><p>Czechoslovak animation is a large topic that’s appeared many times in the newsletter. You may know our pieces on the <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/a-legends-animated-wool">wool films</a> of Hermína Týrlová, the <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/a-visual-tour-of-karel-zeman">cinematic trickery</a> of Karel Zeman and the <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-grandmaster-of-stop-motion">career and impact</a> of Jiří Trnka. Yet there’s a lot we’ve mentioned only in passing, if at all. </p><p>What about <em>Pat and Mat</em>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrOJoSSAonip4haRjsbF69_OMwErzS4xC">Mach and Šebestová</a></em> and the chaotic, joyful <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeuE4OafsZk&amp;list=PLrOJoSSAonirsC7MpWk4YFFl4asDjTPRj&amp;index=1">Hey Mister, Let’s Play</a></em>? What about <em>Little Mole</em> and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eugdw_l0A2U">The Vanished World of Gloves</a></em> — and the nightmare visions of Jan Švankmajer? Even those are just the beginning.</p><p>Czechoslovakia built one of the world’s richest, hardest-to-summarize animation scenes. Artists worked in all styles, with all materials: drawings, but also <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/animating-with-glass">glass</a> and <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/dark-visions-in-walnut-wood">wood</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/tyrlova-film">pastry dough</a>. It was wonderful stuff. And, in 1991, an exhibition tried to map its history.</p><p>The country was changing at the time. In ‘89, the dictatorship got overthrown by a mass, peaceful uprising (the “Velvet Revolution”), and the Iron Curtain came down. Czechoslovakia itself dissolved, again peacefully, around three years later.</p><p>Between those two events, this exhibition opened at a museum in New Jersey. On display were puppets, sets, films and more; the <em>New York Times</em> found it all “utterly charming.”<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> It was billed as an attempt to “widen [America’s] perception of this often underappreciated art form” through the magic of animated films from Czechoslovakia.</p><p>The show’s title was <em>Krátký Film: The Art of Czechoslovak Animation</em>. Accompanying it was a catalog — with photos, stills and English essays about the whole sweep of the country’s animation. It’s a great intro to the scene, and a source we’ve valued for years. We’ve decided to preserve that catalog on the Internet Archive.</p><p>You can view it online below. For a </p>...</source>
