          <strong>Skeuomorph</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author uses &#039;skeuomorphically&#039; to describe how writing culture has become about the symbolic trappings rather than the substance. Understanding skeuomorphism—design elements that imitate older forms without functional necessity—illuminates the author&#039;s critique of modern writing culture.</p>

          <strong>Reynard the Fox</strong>
          <span class="read-time">17 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author directly mentions this medieval French literary cycle as an example of content that doesn&#039;t perform well with readers. This 12th-13th century collection of satirical beast fables featuring Reynard the Fox is a fascinating piece of medieval literature most readers won&#039;t know deeply.</p>

          <strong>Edison&#039;s Black Maria</strong>
          <span class="read-time">10 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author mentions Thomas Edison&#039;s Black Maria studio as one of the eclectic topics The Hinternet has covered. This was the world&#039;s first film production studio, built in 1893, and represents a pivotal moment in cinema history that most readers likely know little about.</p>

        <p>Friends! <em>Please </em>remember that <em>The Hinternet</em> will be going<strong> paid-subscription-only</strong> as of <strong>January 1</strong>. We sincerely want to bring as many of you as possible into the semi-exclusive and self-sequestering community of readers that can really only exist beneath a paywall. For that reason, between now and the end of the year we are offering a <strong>massive</strong> discount on paid subscriptions. It is in your interest to get in <em>now</em>!</p><p>You will also be aware, no doubt, that we are entering the season of giving. Some readers have found at Christmases past that a <em>Hinternet </em>subscription has the power to warm its recipient’s hearts, which sometimes triggers an escalatory spiral of quid-pro-quo generosity that can have no real end. So please consider giving a subscription to your friends or loved ones as a gift, and get ready for the boons to redound back upon you in turn.</p><p>(Unfortunately there does not seem to be a way to configure the gift subscription offer so as to include the massive discount, but what can we say? Do it anyway? This <em>is </em>about giving, after all.)</p><p>On our side, we <em>need</em> a high percentage of paid subscriptions in order to maintain the <em>Hinternet</em> as a viable operation — to pay our guest contributors, to pursue larger-scale cultural initiatives, to pay our (real, human) assistants and collaborators, to maintain all the various monthly subscriptions for all the apps and tools that enable us to do what we do, etc. On your side, the simple fact is that the only <em>Hinternet</em> experience worth having at all is the one made possible by a paid subscription. Everything else is loitering in the parking-lot.</p><p>You should also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Psychedelics-Philosophy-Nature-Reality/dp/1324094974">buy my book</a>, both for yourself and as a gift for your friends and loved ones. The critics, so far, are unanimous: they deem it great. But in order to be allowed to write more “great” books (I’ve got one cooking up on love right now), this one has to make back the money paid to its author as an advance, and in order for that to happen, you all need to start clicking “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Psychedelics-Philosophy-Nature-Reality/dp/1324094974">purchase</a>” in greater numbers, adopting it for your book clubs, your school curricula, your indices librorum prohibitorum (in which case you are invited, nay encouraged, to buy all copies in existence, and to burn them). </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Psychedelics-Philosophy-Nature-Reality/dp/1324094974" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png" width="412" height="605.8823529411765" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1400,&quot;width&quot;:952,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:412,&quot;bytes&quot;:2179294,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Psychedelics-Philosophy-Nature-Reality/dp/1324094974&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.the-hinternet.com/i/180262862?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w2d5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71fb90bd-0736-48bf-be64-67bcef7f29bb_952x1400.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>“How,” you might be asking now, </p>...</source>
