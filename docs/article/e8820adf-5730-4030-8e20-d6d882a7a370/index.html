It is likely that any sweeping action of this sort would not occur until shortly before the inauguration of a future Democratic president-elect. If such action is taken, it is unclear how lengthy Trump’s preemptive-pardon list would ultimately run, though sources say that any list would likely include people such as White House official Stephen Miller, Trump’s policy architect who is behind many (<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/stephen-miller-trump-terror-ice-immigration-military-1235426023/">if not all</a>) of the actions and policies that critics have called out for being openly, gratuitously lawless. </p><p>Some of these intra-administration discussions were sparked, sources say, after certain Democrats publicly suggested that the Supreme Court gifted Trump with broad presidential immunity – but that his underlings were not shielded from accountability. “They’re not always going to be in office,” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker <a href="https://www.ms.now/top-stories/latest/chicago-ice-jb-pritzker-trump-stephen-miller-rcna238264">said</a> in October. “The people who serve for the president, including all the way down to ICE agents, can be held accountable when there’s a change of administration.” </p>
