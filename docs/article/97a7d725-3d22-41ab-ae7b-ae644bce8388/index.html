From 2008 to 2018, trade groups allied with Big Oil and other major climate polluters <a href="https://iceds.anu.edu.au/research/research-stories/big-oil%E2%80%99s-trade-group-allies-outspent-clean-energy-groups-whopping-27x">outspent clean energy trade groups 27 to 1</a>.</p><p>Two of the most climate obstructionist trade associations that work on behalf of major polluters are the <strong>U.S. Chamber of Commerce</strong> and the <strong>Business Roundtable. </strong>The Chamber is “the number one obstruction in the path of a just transition to clean energy,” according to <a href="https://www.changethechamber.org/news-research/obstruction-report-2023">a 2023 report</a> on the group’s long history of anti-climate lobbying. The group was a major voice <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/the-long-game/2023/02/16/dissecting-the-chambers-stance-on-climate-policies-00083181">against</a> President Joe Biden’s signature climate law; it opposed pollution limits for <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/energy/new-chamber-analysis-highlights-flaws-with-epa-powerplant-proposal">power plants</a> and transportation; and it worked to dismantle climate transparency rules for public corporations. Currently, the group is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/vermont-climate-change-superfund-oil-companies-8509341725ec00d26cf74d56588178ab">suing Vermont</a> to stop its game-changing climate law that would hold corporations accountable for damage they do to the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>And though the Business Roundtable insists it supports climate policy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable">the group has lobbied against</a> many major efforts to reduce pollution. The association is currently <a href="https://www.responsible-investor.com/business-roundtable-calls-for-ban-on-environmental-social-and-political-proposals/">calling</a> on Congress to ban environment- and climate- focused shareholder proposals, which often seek to force companies to set more ambitious climate targets, such as Chevron shareholders’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/">successful 2021 proposal</a> to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, the Business Roundtable also “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/10/big-business-sharpens-attack-build-back-better">spent</a> <a href="https://popular.info/p/updates-the-corporate-campaign-to">millions</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/08/31/business-lobbying-democrats-reconciliation/">of</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/big-companies-are-funding-campaign-kill-climate-bill/620278/">dollars</a> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/climate/brt-gm-microsoft-bbb">to</a> <a href="https://popular.info/p/corporations-versus-the-climate">stop</a> the Biden administration’s Build Back Better agenda, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/22685920/democrats-infrastructure-build-back-better-climate-change">included</a> significant efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote clean energy,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/19/top-us-business-lobby-group-climate-action-business-roundtable">the Guardian reported</a>.</p><p>These group’s anti-climate lobbying activities are only possible because of the millions they receive in annual membership payments from corporate members. And according to <a href="https://guiltbytradeassociation.com/#scorecard">a new report</a>, <strong>many of those corporate members claim to be climate champions themselves.</strong></p><h3><strong>The “green” corporations funding climate obstruction</strong></h3><p>The advocacy group ClimateVoice <a href="https://guiltbytradeassociation.com/#scorecard">released</a> a scorecard last week calling out 20 companies for publicly championing climate action while quietly obstructing climate policy through dues payments to The Chamber and Business Roundtable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>These companies “are telling the public that they have these green reputations and they're buying renewable energy,”</strong> said Jennifer Allyn, director of campaigns and programs for ClimateVoice. <strong>“And yet they belong to these organizations that are actively lobbying against it.”</strong></p><p>Many </p>...</source>
