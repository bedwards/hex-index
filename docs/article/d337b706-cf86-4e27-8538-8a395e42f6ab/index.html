        <p class="topic-summary">Borges is extensively discussed in Dan&#039;s letters as a model for understanding artistic creation, self-reflection, and the paradox of literary ambition. His philosophy of the self as the only true character directly parallels the novel&#039;s exploration of neurotic, self-aware artists.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article&#039;s letters cite Borges defending Shakespeare against authorship doubts, using this to illustrate the paradox that masterpieces emerge from unconscious creation rather than literary self-consciousness—a central theme in the characters&#039; struggle with artistic ambition.</p>

As Stephen and Elizabeth grow from precocious children into neurotic artists in their thirties, Matthew Gasda reveals how post-industrial, late 20th century America created a generation too intelligent for ordinary happiness, too self-aware for decisive action: suspended between the working-class pragmatism of their fathers and the creative and spiritual aspirations of their mothers, capable of everything except building lives.</em></p><p><em>Matthew Gasda is the founder of the Brooklyn Center for Theater Research and the author of many books, including the recent novel The Sleepers and Writer’s Diary.</em></p><p>⚬─────────✧─────────⚬</p><p>Stephen had decided that before he left Boston and had to drive five or six hours that he wanted to take a run. Or rather, he ran every day when it was time to run. And it was a gorgeous fall day. He had to get out of the apartment. Elizabeth, who considered it her right, took the opportunity to look through her brother’s things. His text messages weren’t very interesting. No girls, as far as she could tell.
