        <p>Welcome back to “One First,” a (more-than) weekly newsletter that aims to make the U.S. Supreme Court and related legal topics more accessible to lawyers and non-lawyers alike. I’m grateful to all of you for your continued support—and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:</p><p>Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“<strong>On the Docket</strong>”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“<strong>The </strong><em><strong>One First </strong></em><strong>‘Long Read’”</strong>); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, please consider becoming one. And with the arrival of the holiday season, you might also consider whether <a href="https://www.stevevladeck.com/subscribe?gift=true">a gift subscription</a> would be a welcome present (or, at least, an amusing gag) for a friend or family member:</p><p>I wanted to use today’s “Long Read” to flag (and respond to) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/us-supreme-court-legitimacy">a provocative essay published last Friday in </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/19/us-supreme-court-legitimacy">The Guardian</a></em> by Harvard law professor Ryan Doerfler and Yale law professor Sam Moyn, under the headline “It’s time to accept that the US supreme court is illegitimate and must be replaced.” Although Doerfler and Moyn have been beating this particular drum <a href="https://www.californialawreview.org/print/democratizing-the-supreme-court">for some time</a>, what’s new about Friday’s essay is the sharp criticism they direct toward “liberal lawyers,” specifically Penn law professor (and <em>Strict Scrutiny</em> co-host) Kate Shaw and me, who, in their words, “have focused their criticism on the <em>manner</em> in which the supreme court has advanced its noxious agenda,” rather than the noxiousness of the agenda itself, at least in part because, according to Doerfler and Moyn, we’re worried about undermining the Court’s legitimacy.</p><p>As they write (referring to one of my earlier posts), we worry “that concluding the supreme court is beyond redemption is too close to ‘nihilism’ about the constitution, or even about law itself.” They, on the other hand, are unabashed: “In Trump’s second term, the Republican-appointed majority on the supreme court has brought their institution to the brink of illegitimacy. Far from pulling it back from the edge, our goal has to be to push it off.”</p><p>Below the fold, I offer two distinct responses to Doerfler and Moyn. The first is to correct their depiction of what I actually believe (I wouldn’t presume to speak for Professor Shaw, although my suspicion is that our views here largely align).
