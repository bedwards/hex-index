The above is one of many such cases. Yet few touch on why things are as absurd as they are. This comical insanity didn’t start today or last month or even last decade, we’ve been on this trajectory for a long while. The silver lining is this Regime is in fact crumbling, many within the Regime know this. They also don’t know what to do anymore or how to fight against it. The special pleading, the confidence games, ad hominems, agit prop, and strawmen; its yielding diminishing returns. The Regime lacks any creativity because the people that designed it and ran it died off and the Lemmings they educated to come after them are stupid on purpose. They were taught slogans to chant and declarative sentences to say with the utmost confidence and pride without the ability to question where they came from and why they exist in the first place.</p><p><em>“The Left gave their radicals six figure no show jobs and The Right cancelled theirs.” -</em>Pete Quinones</p><p><strong>What Happened</strong></p><p>Following WW2 and the victory of the Allied Powers, the world was finally “Made Safe for Democracy”. Christian Monarchy’s and Tiny Mustache Man who were “oppressive”, “intolerant of others”, and “backward” were vanquished. The Nuremberg Regime had to be implemented worldwide to ensure nothing like them arose again. And now that the US was a superpower; they had license and cachet to do so. Liberal Globalism at all costs.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" target="_self">3</a> <em>“We shall pay any price, bear any burden…” </em><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" target="_self">4</a></p><p>But this didn’t happen easily, Stalin stiff-arming the Marshall Plan forced The Cold War (The US never stopped trade with the USSR-take a look at the various loopholes of the Johnson Act).<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" target="_self">5</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" target="_self">6</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7" href="#footnote-7" target="_self">7</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8" href="#footnote-8" target="_self">8</a> This necessitated a constellation of collective security organizations, think tanks, tax-exempt foundations, and policy groups to fight the Soviets, dialectically the <em>rasion d etre</em> of these organization was to promote America as “The real freedom fighters and liberators” in opposition to Soviet Authoritarianism.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-9" href="#footnote-9" target="_self">9</a> <a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-10" href="#footnote-10" target="_self">10</a> The hearts and minds of the rest of the world were up for grabs between the two superpowers. The flywheel was in place for liberalism and democracy to take hold, but this yielded the devastation of <em>GloboHomo</em> and <em>McWorld</em> (You are going to accept usurious and perpetual debt schemes and degeneracy of all forms or else!). </p>...</source>
