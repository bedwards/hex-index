      <p>Hey friends, </p><p>This is my first email newsletter. It’s a bit of a test, but the plan is that every week I’m going to be sharing some thoughts and musings from the week. Not sure if anyone is going to find this useful, but I watched a video from my favourite YouTuber Ali Abdaal (check out his channel if you haven’t already), and he encouraged me to start. </p><p><span>This is going to be my first foray into the world of internet writing, and I’m excited to officially be a </span><em>creator</em><span>. Okay, that sounds a bit weird, I definitely don’t identify as a creator just yet. Maybe I never will. But that’s okay. </span></p><p>I know I’ve thought about being a creator enough times that this is the push I needed to finally get started with it. </p><p>Nothing else to write this week. Maybe other issues will be like this, maybe not, who knows. But if you’re reading this, then I’d enccourage you to take that plunge and start that thing you’ve been dreaming about too. </p><p>It doesn’t bite - I promise :)</p><p>Have a great week! </p><p>Ali xx</p>
