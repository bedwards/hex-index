      <div class="article-excerpt">
        <p>Back in May 2025, not long after I put out the first call for <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/s/ai-killed-my-job">AI Killed My Job</a> stories, I received a thoughtful submission from Jacques Reulet II. Jacques shared a story about his job as the head of support operations for a software firm, where, among other things, he wrote copy documenting how to use the company’s product.</p><p>“AI didn’t quite kill my current job, but it does mean that most of my job is now training AI to do a job I would have previously trained humans to do,” he told me. “It certainly killed the job I used to have, which I used to climb into my current role.” He was concerned for himself, as well as for his more junior peers. As he told me, “I have no idea how entry-level developers, support agents, or copywriters are supposed to become senior devs, support managers, or marketers when the experience required to ascend is no longer available.”</p><p>When we checked back in with Jacques six months later, his company had laid him off. “I was actually let go the week before Thanksgiving now that the AI was good enough,” he wrote. </p><p>He elaborated:</p><blockquote><p>Chatbots came in and made it so my job was managing the bots instead of a team of reps. Once the bots were sufficiently trained up to offer “good enough” support, then I was out. I prided myself on being the best. The company was actually awarded a “Best Support” award by G2 (a software review site). We had a reputation for excellence that I’m sure will now blend in with the rest of the pack of chatbots that may or may not have a human reviewing them and making tweaks.</p></blockquote><p>It’s been a similarly rough year for so many other workers, as chronicled by this project and elsewhere—from <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/artists-are-losing-work-wages-and">artists and illustrators</a> seeing client work plummet, to <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/ai-killed-my-job-translators">translators</a> losing jobs en masse, to <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39">tech workers</a> seeing their roles upended by managers eager to inject AI into every possible process. </p><p>And so we end 2025 in AI Killed My Jobs with a look at copywriting, which was among the first jobs singled out by <a href="https://www.jasper.ai/blog/ai-copywriting">tech firms</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/business/economy/jobs-ai-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt.html">the media</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-jobs-economy">copywriters themselves</a> as particularly vulnerable to job replacement. One of the early replaced-by-AI reports was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/02/ai-taking-jobs/">the sadly memorable story</a> of the copywriter whose senior coworkers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-openai-jobs-laid-off-copywriter-says-replaced-with-ai-2023-6">started referring to her</a> as “ChatGPT” in work chats ...</p>
