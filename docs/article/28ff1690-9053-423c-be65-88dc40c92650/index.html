(This year, I think my own tomato plants produced five average tomatoes. Total.)</p><p>Today we say goodbye for the season and, well, goodbye forever… <em>sorry for the drama!</em> Some of you have followed all of this farm share chronicling for three years (two here on Substack and previously on my blog), and I’m so grateful for all of your helpful notes, recipe suggestions, and questions along the way. Thank you for reading and for your genuine interest in strategizing to make the most of a weekly share of vegetables, a subject that has been near and dear to my heart for nearly 20 years. </p><p>Every year I belong to a farm share, I learn something new, and while that alone might be reason enough to keep this newsletter going, I’m not sure I have another season’s worth of insights about prepping, planning, and preserving (<strong><a href="https://farmsharenewsletter.substack.com/p/3-tenets-of-successful-farm-sharing">The 3 Tenets of Successful Farm Sharing</a></strong>) to keep this weekly newsletter interesting for all of you. </p><p>But, this newsletter isn’t going anywhere, and you, of course, can reference any of the posts from <strong><a href="https://farmsharenewsletter.substack.com/archive">the archives</a></strong> from now until forever. Also, if you want to still hang out, good news: <em>we can!</em> </p><p>As most of you know, I wrote another book, <em><strong><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/pizza-night/">Pizza Night</a></strong></em>, which is currently available for <strong><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/pizza-night/">pre-order</a></strong>. In sum, <em><strong><a href="https://alexandracooks.com/pizza-night/">Pizza Night</a></strong></em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/717603/pizza-night-by-alexandra-stafford/">​</a> includes 52 pizza and 52 salad recipes, one combination for every week of the year, as well as five simple desserts. It's organized seasonally and includes recipes for the home oven, outdoor oven, the grill, Sicilian-style, Detroit-style, grandma-style, skillet pizzas, and more. </p><p>I learned so much working on this project — about the relationship between dough hydration and oven temperature, about why your dough performs better after it spends a few days in the fridge, about the benefits of parbaking pan pizzas — and I can't wait to </p>...</source>
