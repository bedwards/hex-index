        <p>Well it's been a little bit since I shared any of my thoughts on the recent political and social developments of the day so why not go ahead and let it all out now.

In an earlier post I wrote about not living by lies, as the essay (https://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles/SolhenitsynLies.php) from Alexander Solzhenitsyn promotes. I continue to think that this principle is being greatly ignored by a huge percentage of believers, and it is being ignored to our shame and detriment.
