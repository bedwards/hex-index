In today’s world, it is a shift towards a heightened sense of self — one that is formulated and influenced by the social and cultural capital surrounding us (think memes,  video games, music and more ) to determine our taste, ways of expression and therefore how we ‘discover, buy and wear fashion.’</p><blockquote><p><em>‘Once, fashion genres like punk, preppy, and minimalist used to mark a subculture and define one’s identity, cultural affiliation, values, interests, and social orientation. Now, the tables have turned, and a feeling of self defines genres.’</em></p></blockquote><p>Whilst social and cultural capital are key determinants, I argue that <em>mood</em> is also a major player in cultivating this sense of ‘self.’ Countless studies have been made, like that of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103112000200">Hajo Adam and Adam G Galinsky</a> analysing the ‘symbolic meaning of clothes’ and the wearer’s ‘physical experience of wearing them.’ Essentially, clothes express one’s desired social status and the subcultures we align ourselves with (think streetwear and thrifting for vintage clothing). Through our subjective lenses, ‘taste’ is an amalgamation of items we possess, totems if you will that associate us with our desired social communities. Think what it means now to be a ‘Ganni girl.’ We a genre, emulate its tastemakers and in turn buy totems that bring us symbolically into that community.</p><p>And whilst this way of camaraderie is still prevalent, I really do think our moods heavily influence they way we dress, come together and create content. Resulting in an undercurrent of mood influenced aesthetics.  </p><p> I use this definition of mood: </p><blockquote><p><em>‘a temporary state of mind and wellbeing’</em></p></blockquote><p>Take for example, TikTok’s manifestation craze where people attempt to change their ‘cosmic ordering.’ It is reliant on putting yourself in a ‘temporary state of mind and wellbeing’ in which you are confident and powerful enough to actualise what you really want in life. Think of the girls on social media platforms that want to be ‘that girl.’ And that girl wakes up without fail at 5am, has a consistent workout routine, eats healthy, has her home life in order and sticks to a rigorous almost unchanging schedule. Her wardrobe is mostly neutrals, signally to themselves and to others that life is orderly, calm and in their control. In </p>...</source>
