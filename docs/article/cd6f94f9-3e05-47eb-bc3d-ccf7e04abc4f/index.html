        <p><strong>✨Full article break down as a Q&amp;A section with Alex Kadet included at the end.✨</strong></p><h1><strong>Gero’s Chugai Deal: Aging Biology Moves Into the Pharma Mainstream</strong></h1><p><strong>AI drug-discovery company Gero has signed a licensing deal with Roche-owned Chugai. In a crowded field of AI startups, it was Gero’s commitment to aging biology that made it stand out.</strong></p><p>While most coverage focused on the financials, this story is bigger than a headline. It signals that aging biology is reshaping early-stage drug discovery—and that pharma is no longer just watching from the sidelines.</p><p>In a behind-the-scenes interview with <strong>Alex Kadet</strong>, the business developer who led the commercial effort, we unpack how the deal came together — and what it means for the field.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>Modeling Aging to Treat Disease</strong></h2><p>Gero treats aging as a <strong>dynamic system</strong> that can be measured, modeled, and intercepted. Using physics-based analyses of longitudinal human data, the company pinpoints how biological resilience erodes over time, then targets the mechanisms driving that decline.</p><p>That systems-level lens is what first drew Chugai’s attention, according to <strong>Alex Kadet</strong>, Business Developer at Gero.</p><blockquote><p>"The first conversation with Chugai happened in mid 2021, just after we had raised our round," Alex told us. "We had something that stood out—not just AI, but a new way of thinking about biology as a physical system."</p></blockquote><p>But the conversations truly picked up after Gero’s 2023 partnership with Pfizer, which gave the team access to larger-scale human datasets.</p><blockquote><p>"Once we started showing traction on both technology platform development and industrial partnerships leveraging human data – the interest from Chugai got more serious. The Pfizer partnership was a key unlock."</p></blockquote><p>This two-year journey from first in-depth conversation on the potential contact to deal signing underscores a key lesson for biotech founders: <strong>pharma moves slowly</strong>, and partnerships are built through consistent, long-term engagement.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>From Human Data to a Licensed Target</strong></h2><p>The assets Chugai licensed— undisclosed <strong>age-related-disease targets</strong>—followed Gero’s “human-first” pipeline:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Discovery in real-world people:</strong> Large-scale human datasets revealed a vulnerability tied to loss of resilience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Physics-based prioritization:</strong> Gero’s model flagged specific mechanisms as a high-leverage intervention points.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>"Pharma wants human data. That’s what helps to get the conversation started," Alex explained.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Gero’s approach—predicting in humans, then proving in animals—demonstrates a translational model that can resonate with pharma's need for risk mitigation.</p><div><hr></div><h2><strong>The Deal: Structure &amp; Milestones</strong></h2><p>Gero tells us the agreement with Chugai includes:</p><ul><li><p>A <strong>confidential upfront </strong></p></li>...</ul>
