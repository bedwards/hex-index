        <p>OpenAI has just made its premium <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10986084-student-discounts-for-chatgpt-terms-of-service">ChatGPT Plus subscription</a> available for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through May, just in time for final exams! This gives students access to advanced features like O3-mini reasoning model, image generation, voice interaction, and powerful research tools, all designed to help them tackle their studies more effectively. </p><p>This move intensifies competition with Anthropic, which recently launched <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education">Claude for Education</a>, a tailored version of Claude aimed at higher education institutions. It features a “learning mode” designed to help students learn by guiding their reasoning rather than simply providing answers. </p><p>The race is on as AI startups are rapidly reshaping the education landscape, changing the way students learn and work. In this edition, we’ll take a behind-the-scenes look at these edtech startups and explore how students feel about using AI tools.</p><p><strong>Here is an overview of today’s newsletter: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Key takeaways from edtech leaders in our recent AI x Education webinar</p></li><li><p>Insights on student perspectives and real-world use cases of AI</p></li><li><p>Exploring AI’s potential to enhance student collaboration and group work</p></li><li><p>How AI edtech platforms are making learning more accessible around the world</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>🚀 Practical AI Usage and Policies</h2><h4>⭐️  Insights from our AI x Education Webinar Series</h4><p>At our recent AI x Education webinar, <em>AI in the Classroom: Practical Insights from Leading Edtech Innovators</em>, Bill Salak (CTO/COO of Brainly) and France Hoang (co-founder/CEO of Boodlebox) shared insights from their experiences building AI-powered education platforms that serve hundreds of thousands of students worldwide.
