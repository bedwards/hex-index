          <strong>Dayton Agreement</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on the 1995 Dayton Agreement as the foundational framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina&#039;s current political structure. Understanding the specific provisions, negotiations, and compromises of this agreement is essential context for the article&#039;s critique of how it &#039;froze the country into a constitutional maze&#039; and why proposals for a &#039;third entity&#039; are now being debated.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">Dodik is a central figure in the article, described as having &#039;built his power on the nonstop manufacture of an existential threat&#039; while presenting himself as having Moscow&#039;s backing. His political career and evolution from moderate to nationalist leader provides crucial context for understanding the current political dynamics in Republika Srpska.</p>

          <span class="read-time">12 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article discusses the &#039;Željko Komšić case&#039; as a symbolic controversy where the Croat member of Bosnia&#039;s Presidency was elected primarily by Bosniak votes. This specific electoral dispute is key to understanding the legitimacy debates around ethnic representation and the push for electoral reform and a potential third entity.</p>
