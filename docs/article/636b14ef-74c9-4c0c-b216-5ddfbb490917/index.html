In 1998, during a trip to Silicon Valley as trade secretary to meet newly emerging tech billionaires, he famously said: “We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich.”</p><p>He likes to point out that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jan/12/tonyblair.labour">he added</a>, “as long as they pay their taxes.” But Blair and Mandelson helped engineer preferential terms that ensured tech giants <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/uk-travel/england/london-travel/microsoft-pays-no-uk-tax-on-1-7bn-a-year-5vvkrk5srjf%20">barely paid</a> any tax in the UK—all in the interests, of course, of “attracting investment.”</p><p>The problem was not simply that New Labour’s priorities came to resemble the Conservatives’.</p><p>Nor was it only that Labour’s cosying up to the super-rich drove the Tories ever further rightwards in an effort to distinguish themselves, a process that ultimately led to the Conservative Party’s implosion and the emergence of a new pretender to the right’s throne in the form of Nigel Farage’s Reform party.</p><p>No, the gravest problem was that, as New Labour and the Tories vied equally for favour with the super-rich and the media outlets they owned in the hope of being ushered into office, neither dared reverse the economic windfalls the billionaires had accrued.</p><p>Nor did either party have any incentive to call out the growing capture and corruption of British politics by the billionaire class—because that capture had become the very point of the political game.</p><p>Thus was born the black box of British politics—until the Epstein Files, released by a <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/trump">Trump</a> administration more concerned with protecting its own secrets than those of British politicians, prised open the lid just enough to reveal what was going on inside.</p><p><strong>Laboratory-grown PM</strong></p><p>British </p>...</source>
