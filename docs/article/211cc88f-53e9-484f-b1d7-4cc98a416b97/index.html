The information on these unlisted websites—including dozens of names of workers and contracted vendors,internal communications about meetings and quarterly plans, and even strategic planning documents—demonstrates how the operation evolved over time.</p><p>Canary’s non-public websites promise expansion into new avenues to continue the group’s mission of punishing Americans for pro-Palestine speech via doxxing, pressure campaigns, and now arrests and deportations carried out by allies in the State Department.</p><p>BlackNest’s web development content reveals how Canary Mission thinks of its “wins” in its efforts to influence U.S. policy. The website categorizes the group’s impacts into categories: “Change of behavior,” job loss, denials of entry to the U.S., arrests, and “deportation/forced to flee.” The site also collects mentions of Canary Mission in media, mostly from U.S. news outlets, and celebrates mentions of their impact.</p><p>Drop Site News <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/canary-mission-funding-funders-networks-transactions-doxxing-united-states-deportation">previously reported</a> how donations are funneled to the group, but who the employees are, how the group functions, and who built their websites have been unknown—due to Canary Mission’s secrecy. Drop Site has now obtained over 100 gigabytes of content and data that was accessed via the backend of Canary Mission’s website, leading to a host of websites that were live but not intended to be found publicly.</p><p>A group of software engineers shared the data they collected from BlackNest’s daily </p>...</source>
