        <p>Hello friends! My apologies for not getting out an April newsletter: I had a family emergency that had me flying back and forth across the country three times last month. Thanks for your patience while I catch back up! The good news is that there’ll be two newsletters in May: this one, and then a guest post mid-month, from an excellent writer with a new book coming out. I’m excited to share their craft essay here! Maybe it’ll be a one-off thing, maybe it’ll be something I do more of in the future. So look forward to that mid-May!</p><p>In June, I’ll be doing another Zoom craft lecture for paying subscribers, on June 3, 2025, at 7pm ET. Next week, I’ll send out a survey with a handful of potential topics to anyone who is currently a paid subscriber at that time, so that you can vote on which lecture you want this time out. If you’d like to be part of that vote and/or the June lecture, all you have to do is subscribe. Thanks again!</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png" width="1456" height="546" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:546,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NUgm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecff5fe7-9eaf-49f4-871b-d2fac721503b_3333x1250.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h2>Write Better Fiction by Reading like a Book Reviewer </h2><p>This past week, I turned in what I believe will be my 40th published book review. I don’t think of myself as a book critic exactly—I’m more a fiction writer who occasionally reviews books—but I did a lot of reviewing in the earliest days of my career and I’ve been doing a lot again over the past few years. (In between I did a good number of interviews with other writers, a complementary form that requires similar prep work.) Reviewing is a part of my broader craft that I’ve enjoyed developing oveer the years, especially because I believe it usefully feeds my fiction writing too.</p><p>That said, I’m not an expert on the craft of criticism, so I don’t think I can write a treatise here on how to write a great review. But what I can do is talk about what book reviewing has done for me as a novelist, via some of the tactics I use to prep a book for review. (These tactics are very similar to how I would ready a story or a book that I’m teaching.)
