          <strong>Goldwater–Nichols Act</strong>

        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article references this as a &#039;once-in-a-generation&#039; reform moment for defense acquisition. The 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act was the last major restructuring of the Department of Defense, establishing joint commands and the current acquisition hierarchy. Understanding this legislation provides essential context for why the FY26 NDAA changes are being compared to it and what structural precedents exist.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article specifically mentions exempting nontraditional contractors from EVMS (Earned Value Management System) requirements. This project management technique has been a cornerstone of defense acquisition oversight since the 1960s. Understanding why it exists and its burden helps readers grasp the significance of these exemptions for new entrants.</p>

        <p>The FY26 NDAA started a year ago with the introduction of the <strong><a href="https://defenseacquisition.substack.com/p/rebuilding-the-dib-with-the-forged">FORGED Act</a></strong> by SASC Chairman Sen Wicker followed by the HASC’s <strong><a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/legislation/the-speed-act.htm">SPEED Act</a></strong> by Reps Rogers and Smith. Both bills provided approaches to streamline acquisition, inject private capital into the procurement process, scale new entrants, bolster supply chains and more rapidly field hedge capabilities. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png" width="414" height="414" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:414,&quot;bytes&quot;:2097506,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://defenseacquisition.substack.com/i/174832415?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_stP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F041a3162-ddcc-4df2-99ba-2ac3090919b2_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This legislation has been paired with a half a dozen executive orders focused on acquisition reforms, an <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Nov/10/2003819439/-1/-1/1/TRANSFORMING-THE-DEFENSE-ACQUISITION-SYSTEM-INTO-THE-WARFIGHTING-ACQUISITION-SYSTEM-TO-ACCELERATE-FIELDING-OF-URGENTLY-NEEDED-CAPABILITIES-TO-OUR-WARRIORS.PDF">Acquisition Transformation Strategy and additional SECWAR direction</a>.
