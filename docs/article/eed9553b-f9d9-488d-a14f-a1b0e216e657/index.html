        <p><a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2024/11/27/university-of-sydney-ai-assessment-policy.html">The University of Sydney recently became one of the first institutions to allow the use of AI for non-secure assessments.</a> Starting next year, students will be permitted to use AI tools like ChatGPT for homework, assignments, and certain types of assessments.</p><p>This new approach divides assessments into two categories: secure, in-person assessments ("lane one"), where AI use is restricted, and open assessments ("lane two"), where AI use is encouraged. The structure ensures students can demonstrate their understanding of the content without the help of AI while also learning how to work with AI effectively in real-world contexts. The role of AI in education and in the workforce will be inevitable, so rather than completely banning it, the University of Sydney takes a unique approach in allowing for the usage of AI while balancing academic integrity.</p><p>As this policy rolls out, it will be fascinating to observe its impact over the coming year and the lessons it may provide for educational institutions around the world. In this newsletter, we'll cover various perspectives on AI policies and highlight some of the latest developments and findings from educational researchers.</p><p><strong>Here is an overview of today’s newsletter: </strong></p><ul><li><p>Diverse perspectives on AI from students, educators, and industry professionals</p></li><li><p>Latest AI policy updates and developments in the United States</p></li><li><p>Key takeaways from Stanford’s Accelerate EdTech Impact Summit</p></li><li><p>Emerging AI Trends in Instructional Design</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h2>🚀 Practical AI Usage and Policies</h2><h4>🎙️ Perspectives on AI</h4><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/05/learning/what-students-are-saying-about-teachers-using-ai-to-grade.html">What Students Are Saying About Teachers Using A.I. to Grade (New York Times)</a></strong></p><p>Hear from students and educators as they weigh in on the following question: <em>Is it unethical for teachers to use artificial intelligence to grade papers if they have forbidden their students from using it for their assignments?</em> Feel free to continue the conversation in the comments below!</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/qa-putting-ai-in-its-place-in-an-era-of-lost-human-connection-at-school/">Q&amp;A: Putting AI In its Place in an Era of Lost Human Connection at School (The 74 Million)</a></strong></p><p>Alex Kotran, the founder of The AI Education Project (aiEDU), discusses his perspective on the importance of AI readiness in helping students build durable skills such as collaboration, communication, and critical thinking.
