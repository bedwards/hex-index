This year, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, said, “I think one day maybe we can cure all disease with the help of AI. I think that’s within reach, maybe within the next decade or so. I don’t see why not.” Is he right? In this episode, we figured we’d tackle that head on. I’m Saloni Dattani, this is Jacob Trefethen, and we’re presenting the new podcast, Hard Drugs.</p><p>Jacob Trefethen:</p><p>So far, we’ve talked about what proteins are, how they can be medicines like insulin, how AI can help scientists improve proteins to make even better drugs, and how AI can help design entirely new proteins never seen in nature.</p><p>Saloni Dattani:</p><p>Now we’ll zoom out to look at the drug development process as a whole, talk about what AI might speed up and where new drugs might still get stuck. This one is necessarily more speculative than usual; we’re going to draw on examples from the past and talk about the possibilities of the future.</p><p>Jacob Trefethen:</p><p>You can leave the end of the episode with better guesses of whether AI is about to change everything or whether it will be one tool among many that scientists can draw on. Will we cure all disease in 10 years? Let’s get into it.</p><p>Saloni Dattani:</p><p>I recently read this blog post by <span class="mention-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Claus Wilke&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:64064132,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f86ed0b8-faec-478f-9afa-6a59f2c148fc_2000x2000.png&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;8aa4e6d2-8d31-4f46-ae2f-6d729f80891e&quot;}" data-component-name="MentionToDOM"></span>, and he says, “We still can’t predict much of anything in biology.” I thought that was kind of interesting because the last two episodes we’ve talked about how AI is being used to improve protein structure prediction and design new proteins. But he basically explains that even though there ...</p>
