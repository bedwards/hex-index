        <p>La Guajira is a windy and sunny peninsula in northern Colombia. With an exceptional renewable resource, the area is key to Colombia’s energy transition aspirations.</p><p>But so far La Guajira has failed to deliver. Even though the first wind farm was opened in La Guajira in 2004, development has since then stalled. The region has not added any meaningful capacity.</p><p>The main obstacle to developing wind capacity in La Guajira is the difficulty of community engagement. La Guajira is populated by the Wayúu people, an indigenous community that has not reached an agreement with wind project developers.</p><p>In what follows, I analyze La Guajira’s wind energy difficulties based on a series of interviews and conversions in the region in August 2025.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png" width="1270" height="958" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:958,&quot;width&quot;:1270,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1307931,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://energyprof.substack.com/i/173935997?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WVCv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea0524e-d47c-43ed-b573-6c94d1316aed_1270x958.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Professor Johannes in front of the inactive Jepirachi wind farm in northernmost La Guajira.

The complementarity of resources offers natural risk mitigation: wind production peaks at night and in certain seasons, while solar provides predictable daytime output.</p><p>Despite these resources, La Guajira has only a few active wind farms.

La Guajira does not have a well-developed electricity infrastructure. But given the quality of the wind resource, this problem could be overcome. It is a technical and financial challenge that has not stopped renewable energy development elsewhere.</p><p>The second is permitting and regulations. These issues have caused delays and increased costs. But wind projects in La Guajira have not failed just because permits, licenses, and regulations are cumbersome.</p><p>The third possibility is difficulties with community engagement and public support.
