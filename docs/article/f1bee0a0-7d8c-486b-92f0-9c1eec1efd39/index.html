I correct these as I see them, and will highlight important corrections later, but I can’t guarantee I will have caught them all by the time you read this.]</em></p><p><strong>1: </strong>Ben Goldhaber: <a href="https://bengoldhaber.substack.com/p/unexpected-things-that-are-people">Unexpected Things That Are People</a>. “It’s widely known that corporations are people . . . but there are other, less well known non-human entities that have also been accorded the rank of [legal] person.”</p><p><strong>2: </strong>Jackdaw was originally Jack Daw. Magpie was originally Maggie Pie (really!) Robin Redbreast is still Robin Redbreast. Weird Medieval Guys explains <a href="https://weirdmedievalguys.substack.com/p/how-birds-got-human-names">how birds got human names</a>. Short version: there was a medieval tradition of giving every animal one standard human name (all worms were “William Worm”, all monkeys were “Robert Monkey”) and although these are mostly forgotten, they survived in the names of a few birds. Also: “Perhaps the most baffling … was the common Kestrel. He was known simply as the Windfucker.”</p><p><strong>3: </strong><a href="https://x.com/magnushambleton/status/1995459217407217698">A story “in the style of Scott Alexander or Jack Clark”</a> about the two-door meme (meme below).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg" width="236" height="276.6896551724138" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:680,&quot;width&quot;:580,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:236,&quot;bytes&quot;:41221,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/180777884?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yDAh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c4506ff-69e4-42c5-b826-bd2d1179cc3e_580x680.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>And if you enjoyed the story, <a href="https://x.com/magnushambleton/status/1995459412463403045">here’s the chaser</a>.</p><p><strong>4: </strong>Fox Chapel Research: <a href="https://foxchapelresearch.substack.com/p/i-think-substrate-is-fraudulent-part">I Think Substrate Is A $1 Billion Fraud</a> (and notes for <a href="https://foxchapelresearch.substack.com/p/notes-for-part-2-of-the-substrate">Part 2</a>). For years, Taiwan’s TSMC has been the only company capable of producing the most advanced AI chips; since Taiwan is a geopolitical flashpoint, this is a constant threat to US tech ambitions. Last month, a new startup called Substrate announced it had developed technology that would let it manufacture 100% Made In America chips every bit the equal of TSMC’s. If true, this would be revolutionary. But Fox Chapel finds worrying signs, like that the company’s founder “is a known con artist involved in such other things as [claiming to have solved] nuclear fusion and stealing $2.5M in a Kickstarter scam” or that “the company’s job postings are nonsensical and AI-generated.” This is enough for me; the question now becomes how so many people were taken in - the company got $150 million from investors led by Peter Thiel, was endorsed by the Trump administration, and received positive portrayals in Semianalysis, NYT, and The Free Press. I don’t understand business, and I know that sometimes you can hyperstition a technology into existence </p>...</source>
