        <p>The China leg of the 2025 World History Tour was one of the most demanding. Why? China’s history is so vast. I know a fraction of it, and none of the language. To enter this maze as a beginner was tough. </p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Four videos to watch now or later in the week</strong></p><p><em>A quick note. I have rescheduled the concluding recap post on Russia till the end of the month, and similarly put back my planned mini-series on YouTube on Gorbachev and Soviet Collapse.
