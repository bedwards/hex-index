        <p>Happy holiday party season, education friends. Here’s your annual reminder that it’s OK to just say no to the invitations. Tell them you’re too busy reading SCHOOLED.</p><p>Today I ask how far the Trump administration should go in allowing flexibility under ESSA’s accountability rules. I also catch up on edu-opinions from Heather Hough, Natalie Wexler, Michael Horn, Chad Aldeman, Jared Cooney Horvath, Tim Daly, Idrees Kahloon, Colyn Ritter, and Aidan Schief. And Jared Polis says yes to Trump’s education tax credit initiative.</p><div class="pullquote"><p><em>Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox on Tuesday and Friday mornings.

The Hoosier State is the first to propose that <strong>Secretary Linda McMahon</strong> use her waiver authority to allow major changes to federal education policy related to accountability. (A separate issue is Indiana’s request for funding flexibility, which I will leave for another day, and which is somewhat akin to what <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/iowa-submits-plan-to-combine-federal-education-funds-and-experts-are-skeptical/">Iowa has proposed, as well</a>.)</p><p>Given its ed reform bona fides and the strong reputation of state superintendent <strong>Katie Jenner</strong>, the feds’ response could open the floodgates to imitators.</p><p>Back in August, a coalition of ed reform organizations <a href="https://edtrust.org/press-room/joint-comment-on-indianas-draft-essa-waiver-application/">urged</a> Indiana to deep-six or fundamentally alter its waiver request, to no avail. (Those included <strong>All4Ed</strong>, <strong>Education Trust</strong>, <strong>National Parents Union</strong>, and <strong>UnidosUS</strong>, among others.) Now it’s up to <strong>Secretary McMahon</strong> and <strong>Assistant Secretary</strong> <strong>Kirsten Baesler</strong> to decide how to respond.</p><p>Personally, I think it’s naïve to expect Trump officials to reject the waiver proposal outright. They have been insistent (if not consistent) in their desire to return power to the states, and have welcomed waiver requests, so they will surely find a way to get to yes. The question, then, is what exactly they should assent to—and what pieces they should reject.</p><p>That’s where you come in. What would you recommend that <strong>McMahon</strong> and <strong>Baesler</strong> do? What parts of Indiana’s proposal can reformers live with? And where should bright lines be drawn?</p><p><strong>How would Indiana’s new A–F accountability system work?</strong></p><p>At the heart of Indiana’s waiver request is its new accountability system.
