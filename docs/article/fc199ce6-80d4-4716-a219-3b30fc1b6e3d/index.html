        <p>     To say that “letting go and moving on” has been a slow and difficult process would be a tremendous understatement. This past year and a half has been one of the most difficult periods of my life, and after over 20 years in vocational ministry, and coming on the back of Covid, that is saying a lot. It began in the summer of 2021 when I was informed that a group in the church I was pastoring was no longer happy with what was going on in the church.
