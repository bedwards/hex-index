        <p>“Good things take time…but great things happen all at once.”</p><p>That’s a quote from the movie Rat Race.</p><p>It’s a ridiculous comedy where people compete to find a bag of money.</p><p>As silly as that movie is…the quote stands true.</p><p>Good things <em>do</em> take time. You must work at them. Build them.</p><p>…but then suddenly, as if by some sudden force of nature, those good things turn into great things.</p><p>And it happens faster than you can imagine.</p><p>Seemingly “all at once.”</p><p>Let me give you an example…</p><p>Imagine yourself trying to push a boulder off a hill.</p><p>You push and strain. You’re tired.</p><p>…but keep pushing and the boulders barely seem to move at all.</p><p>You nudge it one inch. Then another inch.</p><p>Until suddenly…</p><p>It rolls down the hill at a blistering pace. Taking out the obstacles in its way.</p><p>The momentum that YOU gave it from pushing makes it a near-impossible force to stop.</p><p>Your workflows and productivity act on the same underlying principle as the boulder.</p><p>(Except without the sweating and pushing…and a lot less hard work.)</p><p>All you have to do is take small actions toward improving your workflow every day.</p><p>You may not see any changes in your productivity and performance right away.</p><p>…but you keep doing that “one small action” until BOOM. You start to get a little more done in a little less time.</p><p>Then you keep going…and BOOM again. You drove a stronger result with less effort.</p><p>See…your productivity, performance, and business…don’t and/or doesn’t always improve gradually.</p><p>You won’t see your results boost while your input declines every few days or each week.</p><p>It improves in “leaps and bounds.”</p><p>However, if you have no system (or a scrappy one) in place, and you make some adjustments…</p><p>…you can see a major change in your time/effort spent and the results you drive.</p><p>One of the quickest and easiest things you can do is get some sort of “prioritization system” in place.</p><p>In fact, I recently recorded a workshop about “Getting the Right Work Done.”</p><p>Dozens of people have watched it and applied the system to their own workflows.</p><p>Now they’ve decreased their inputs…but increased their results.</p><p>Your results may not be as big…but you’ll get some results.</p><p>Just as long as you take that one small action a day!</p><p>How do you know what action to take? Simple…</p><p>The <em>Getting the Right </em>...</p>
