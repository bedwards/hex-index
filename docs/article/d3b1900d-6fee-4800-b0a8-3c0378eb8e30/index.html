        <p class="topic-summary">The article centers on tensions and developments in this unrecognized breakaway state. Understanding its Soviet-era origins, the 1992 war, Russian military presence, and unique political status as a frozen conflict zone provides essential context for the mobilization rumors and gas crisis discussed.</p>

        <p><em>Hi and welcome back to Moldova Matters. The holiday season is in full swing in Chisinau - which anyone who lives here know makes for a chaotic schedule. Everyone is rushing to get all their work done before the extended winter holidays and everyone is also holding their holiday parties and get togethers as well. Moldova Matters is going to have a slightly altered publishing schedule through the new year. We’ll have lots of content coming out, but the Weekly Roundups will sometime be delayed and combined.</em> </p><h2>Is Transnistria Preparing for War?</h2><p>Last week Ukrainian news outlet Ukrinform reported that Transnistria was preparing for war. <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/4068084-rosia-terminovo-aktivizuetsa-u-pridnistrovi-sob-vidvolikti-resursi-ukraini-dzerelo-v-gur.html">They wrote</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>“In particular, mobilization measures have been intensified in the territory of the so-called PMR </em>[Transnistria]<em> - reservists are being called up to military formations of quasi-formations, and weapons are being deconserved in warehouses.</em></p><p><em>Also, UAV production and drone operator training centers have been launched in Transnistria.”</em></p></blockquote><p>They went on to write that the goal was to divert Ukrainian resources and destabilize Moldova. Ukrinform cited an unnamed source in the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.</p><p>Initially, Moldovan <a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/ukrinform-rusia-intensifica-pregatirile-militare-in-regiunea-transnistreana-autoritatile-de-la-chisinau-nu-comenteaza-informatiile/">government sources</a> were slow to comment on the story leaving local outlets to print it with a “no comment” from relevant agencies. This was reversed the following day (December 11th) with Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatîi <a href="https://www.zdg.md/stiri/ministrul-apararii-despre-informatiile-ca-rusia-intensifica-pregatirile-militare-in-regiunea-transnistreana-e-o-exagerare/">stating</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>“The very existence of this uncontrolled territory, the illegal presence of the Russian Federation, its forces on our territory is a possibility for manipulation on this topic and discussions. The fact that state institutions are not present there, do not monitor, do not follow all activities gives an opportunity to come up with such statements.</em></p><p><em>“What is related to mobilization activities or how it was said that weapons are already being received and so on is an exaggeration, it is not so. The fact that activities are being carried out in the region is correct and they have constantly carried out all kinds of activities,”</em></p></blockquote><p>Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration Valeriu Chiveri <a href="https://newsmaker.md/ru/kiver-prokommentiroval-soobsheniya-o-roste-aktivnosti-rf-v-pridnestrove-my-ne-raspolagaem-takoi-informacziei">further clarified saying</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Relevant agencies are responsible for security issues. Our colleagues working in this area have not recorded any actions different from those that occurred previously”</em></p></blockquote><p>A government source, speaking to Moldova Matters stated that they see nothing unusual in the region and that the situation is calm. </p><p><em><strong>Recall</strong>: in late February 2024 a series of reports (with poor </em>...</p>
