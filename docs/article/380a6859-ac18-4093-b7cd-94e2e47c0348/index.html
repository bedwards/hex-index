        <p class="topic-summary">The article references the 2003 ALCS heartbreak and mentions the 2004 Red Sox &#039;idiots&#039; team. The 2004 ALCS is one of the most historic comebacks in baseball history, where the Red Sox became the first team to overcome a 3-0 series deficit, directly following the painful 2003 loss described in this article.</p>

        <p class="topic-summary">The article pivots on Tim Wakefield&#039;s knuckleball that &#039;didn&#039;t quite knuckle enough&#039; leading to Aaron Boone&#039;s walk-off home run. Understanding the physics and unpredictability of this unusual pitch explains why it&#039;s both a devastating weapon and an enormous risk in high-pressure situations.</p>

So deep, in fact, that they were one Game 7 away from the World Series. Not only that, but the team standing in our way — yes, <em>our</em> way — was our archrival, the New York Yankees.</p><p>Red Sox-Yankees is supposed to be one of the most intense rivalries in sports, but for years it was a rather lopsided one. During our nearly century-long drought, the Yankees racked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees#World_Series_championships">TWENTY-SIX World Series titles</a>. So by the time the 2003 American League Championship Series began, the rivalry meant a hell of a lot more to us than it did to them.</p><p>I was attending Brandeis University at the time. I tagged along with a high school friend and some other kids to go watch Game 7 on a big screen in a large auditorium at Boston University, probably because we just wanted to watch in a large crowd and mostly couldn’t get into bars (Boston takes, or at least took, a Stasi-like attitude toward underage drinking, in terms of carding policies). A lot of New York kids come to Boston for college, so unfortunately, while the auditorium was mostly Sox fans, there was a large contingent of Yankees fans in the back. Mostly sex offenders, I can only assume.</p><p>I am no longer a big Red Sox fan. Baseball was always my third-favorite sport to watch, behind the NFL and NBA (outside of hockey, which I don’t really watch, college sports barely exist in the Boston sports universe), and as I got older I found I just didn’t have it in me to keep up. Back then, though, I was, like perhaps a million other greater Boston residents, <em>deeply</em> invested in the 2003 Red Sox. We had our stars: Anyone with even a passing awareness of recent baseball history will remember Pedro Martinez (watching him pitch was a <em>sui generis</em> experience as a sports fan), Manny Ramirez (one of the top hitters of his era, as well as a bit of a wildman — “Manny being Manny” was a catchphrase back then when he did something weird, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnYkqvvcw6U">disappear into the Green Monster without explanation</a>), Nomar Garciaparra (a very good hitter in his own right, but a diligent, consummate professional rather than a wildman), </p>...</source>
