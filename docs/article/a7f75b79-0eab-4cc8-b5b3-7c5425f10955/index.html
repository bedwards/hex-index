        <p><em>By: Jason Hickel, Dylan Sullivan and Michail Moatsos</em></p><p>Data from the World Bank suggests that extreme poverty has <a href="https://pip.worldbank.org/poverty-calculator">declined dramatically</a> over the past four decades, from 47% of the world’s population in 1981 to around 10% today.</p><p>This narrative is based on the World Bank’s method of calculating the share of people who live on less than US$3 per day in 2021 prices. This is adjusted for general price differences between countries (what’s known as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/updates/purchasing-power-parity-ppp/">purchasing power parity</a>, or PPP).</p><p>But a growing body of <a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/jgd-2016-0033/html">literature argues</a> that the World Bank’s PPP-based method has a major empirical limitation. The problem is that it does not account for the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.20161080&amp;utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=American_Economic_Review_TrendMD_1">cost of meeting basic needs</a> in any given context. Having more than US$3 PPP does not guarantee that a person can afford the specific goods and services that are necessary for survival in a particular location.</p><p>In recent years, scholars have developed what they argue is a <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-091819-014652">more accurate method</a> for measuring extreme poverty. This is done by comparing people’s incomes to the prices of essential goods (specifically food, shelter, clothing and fuel) in each country.</p><p>This approach is known as the “basic needs poverty line” (BNPL), and it more closely reflects what the original concept of extreme poverty was intended to measure. There is <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2024/04/30/new-research-on-global-poverty/">robust data</a> from household consumption surveys and consumer prices covering the period from 1980-2011.</p><p>The BNPL data indicates that the story of global poverty over the past few decades is more complex – and troubling – than the World Bank narrative suggests.</p><p>This <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2024/04/30/new-research-on-global-poverty/">data indicates that</a> between 1980 and 2011, the global extreme poverty rate declined by only six percentage points, from 23% to 17%. During the same period, the number of people in extreme poverty actually increased, from 1.01 billion to 1.20 billion.</p><div id="datawrapper-iframe" class="datawrapper-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/07mGg/16/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b906f441-41bd-45b0-816b-6a44cd982528_1220x524.png&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url_full&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d654a56-6b2e-481c-bd9b-bfd074646468_1220x818.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:405,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Global extreme poverty&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Basic needs poverty line&quot;}" data-component-name="DatawrapperToDOM"><iframe id="iframe-datawrapper" class="datawrapper-iframe" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/07mGg/16/" width="730" height="405" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>What’s more, the alleviation of poverty has not been steady. In the 1980s and 1990s, an additional one billion people were thrown into extreme poverty. This occurred during the period when <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2023.2217087">market reforms</a> were implemented across most of the global south (developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America), often under pressure from <a href="https://globalinequality.org/global-economic-governance/">western-controlled financial institutions</a>. There was improvement throughout the 2000s, but progress has ultimately been slow and shallow.</p><h2><strong>Rising food insecurity</strong></h2><p>Robust BNPL data does not exist after 2011. However, <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/cb4474en/cb4474en.pdf">data</a> from the UN Food and Agricultural Organization’s (FAO) surveys on food insecurity shows that the proportion of the ...</p>
