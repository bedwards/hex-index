You could argue we already have this or a version of it but I would argue the full manifestation of it has yet to be reached. Technocracy is a word and term that is rarely discussed even in conspiratorial circles yet its design and infrastructure has been heavily funded and built up for decades. Technocracy is <em>“<strong>a form of governance whereby government officials or policymakers, known as technocrats, are chosen by some higher authority due to their technical skills or expertise in a specific domain</strong>.”</em> Or rule by experts; of course the obvious question is who has the authority to deem who the “experts” are? While there is a reality of expertise in any field, the main issue is we always conflate the meaning of power and authority. Power is the ability to use force and control. Authority refers to the legitimacy or right to use of force and control. </p><p>Our bankrupt Enlightenment philosophy has resulted in the tendency of the people it infects to think power is inherently evil. This is an idiotic assumption with no basis, its like saying a computer or a washing machine is inherently evil. At its root this concept is based on the unwillingness to take responsibility for ones own agency and projecting our flaws on an exterior object or thing. Current American culture is awash with this issue as male, patriarchal and fatherly authority is being simultaneously eroded while being actively avoided by men. Power and authority exist, this is a fundamental reality, it cannot be eliminated. At the end of the day the buck has to stop somewhere, someone has to be in control, its just a matter of who that is. </p><p>Author and historian Matthew Raphael Johnson has stated there are only two forms of governance: monarchy and oligarchy, his description of liberalism is the underpinning of the technocracy that is being ushered in by an oligarchy of AI and technological overlords seeking power. </p><p><strong>“Monarchy represents the rulership of God over the earth. God is the author and sustainer of natural law, the earthly monarch is the sustainer of human law. When monarchy falls away so does the patriarchy, once patriarchy falls away the only thing you are </strong></p>...</source>
