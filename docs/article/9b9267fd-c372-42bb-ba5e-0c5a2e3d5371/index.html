        <h3>1.</h3><p>Both science and religion have this in common — that they emerge largely out of our attention to the cycles of the moon. Throughout history and across the world, the lunar calendar has been far more important, in shaping the cycles of ritual feasting and fasting that lie so much deeper than the creeds and the dogmata, than all the things the faithful make explicit in speech about the rituals to which they are already anyway attached. Religion, I am prepared to say, just <em>is</em> ritual, and ritual just is the reflection in culture of the same lunar periodicity that, in our particular corner of the cosmos, does much to shape the rhythms of life itself. Passover, Easter, Ramadan, Diwali — all are pegged to the lunar calendar. And in order to project that calendar into the near-future, in order that is to anticipate upcoming religious holidays, one must calculate.  This, in essence, is the primary reason why, by the 14th century, the mathematicians of the Kerala School of southern India had innovated methods for calculating infinite decimal series — methods that three centuries later would come to be attached to the name of Leibniz, and to constitute one of the supposed innovations of the modern mathematical subfield of calculus. Had there been no defeat of the demon Narakasura by Lord Krishna, in short, there would be no suspension bridges, GPS satellites, or semiconductors either. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg" width="608" height="610.9230769230769" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1463,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:608,&quot;bytes&quot;:651464,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.the-hinternet.com/i/177635210?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IK9K!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a9cc0a-e4b7-4df9-88ee-24689e93bb52_1485x1492.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Galileo Galilei, The Moon Seen through a Telescope, <em>Sidereus Nuncius </em>(1610).

I mean that ritual, founded on what we superficially call “myth”, requires the patterning of time, a task that relies on our innate mathematical aptitude. Over the course of history, diligent exercise of this aptitude cannot fail to lead to breakthroughs with significant practical applications. In this respect, for most of human history, religion and science were manifestly but different dimensions of a single overarching human endeavor. And if we wish to look for a single force or entity that set us down this path to begin with, we could not do much better than to point to the moon. </p><h3>2.</h3><p>It is likely that a major impact event separated the moon from the earth around 4.5 billion years ago, </p>...</source>
