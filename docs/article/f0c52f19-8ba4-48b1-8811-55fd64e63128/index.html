          <strong>Panpsychism</strong>
          <span class="read-time">16 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The article is entirely centered on the author&#039;s defense of panpsychism - the philosophical view that consciousness or mind is a fundamental feature of all things. A deep understanding of this concept&#039;s history, major proponents (like Leibniz, Spinoza, and contemporary philosophers like David Chalmers), and the various forms it takes would provide essential context for evaluating the author&#039;s claims.</p>

          <strong>Cosmological principle</strong>
          <span class="read-time">13 min read</span>
        </a>
        <p class="topic-summary">The author explicitly states their belief in panpsychism is &#039;based largely on the Cosmological Principle&#039; - the assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales. Understanding this principle from physics and how it might be applied philosophically to consciousness would help readers evaluate the logical foundation of the author&#039;s argument.</p>

How many <em>actual</em> books? <em>And</em> YouTube college lectures? <em>Plus </em>tweet threads?</p><p>I specifically <em>don’t</em> think LLM’s are moral agents, meaning I don’t think you are obliged to treat them well beyond not causing deliberate torture. I don’t even think that you <em>can </em>really torture one right now in a product environment.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> You probably have less moral obligation toward an LLM, considered in isolation in today’s world, than you have toward a lizard. However, as we’ll get into below, that comes with <em>major</em> caveats and is a probably pretty short-sighted point of view. For the record, I also think you should be as kind to lizards as circumstances allow.</p><p>The reason I think LLM’s have internal experience is because I think <em>everything</em> has internal experience. Everything is, in some sense, <em>alive</em>. Your thermostat is probably doing something <em>like</em> thinking when it monitors the temperature. This belief is known as panpsychism and after considerable thought, it strikes me as the only plausible model for how consciousness works.</p><p>Everything has experience, but not everything has experience the same way or with the same intensity. </p><p>It also happens to be the case that when you break down what this means, and really think through all the implications, that everything is alive in an almost completely inert and boring way that has almost no consequences in the actual world we interact with everyday. Only humans currently possess the rare configuration of traits that make this underlying spiritual reality supremely meaningful. </p>...</source>
