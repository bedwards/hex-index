        <p>Hi friends,</p><p>Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I enjoyed turkey and time with friends.</p><p>Today’s is a combination “Best of the Year” and gift guide. I pulled some of faves from the past year and paired them with the perfect recipient.</p><p>One of my favorites of the year is — appropriately enough — Layne Fargo’s <em>The Favorites </em>(more on it below). So I’ve teamed up with her publisher to give away ten copies of the new paperback. Even if you’ve read it, you might want this one since it includes a special exclusive chapter from Keith’s point of view. To enter, leave a comment with one of your best reads of the year.</p><p>And, now, what to gift to ..</p><h1><strong>Your Friend Counting Down to the Winter Olympics</strong></h1><h3><strong><a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9780593946442-the-favorites">The Favorites by Layne Fargo</a></strong></h3><p><em>The Favorites </em>is best described as a combination of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9780141439556">Wuthering Heights,</a> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/22722/9781524798642">Daisy Jones and the Six</a> </em>and “I, Tonya.” It follows ice dancers Kat Shaw, who has known since she was a girl she was gold-medal material, and Heath Rocha, who moved in with Kat’s family after a tumultuous time in foster care. The pair clung to each other — on the ice and off — as they navigated a turbulent childhood and rose to champion status, until their relationship and skating partnership collapse after a scandalous reveal at the Olympics.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg" width="380" height="577.5075987841946" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1000,&quot;width&quot;:658,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:380,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Favorites by Layne Fargo&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="The Favorites by Layne Fargo" title="The Favorites by Layne Fargo" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vfz2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b3b7fc7-ee72-4293-8b8b-eb68f61d664b_658x1000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Ten years after their final skate, an unauthorized documentary claims to tell the true story of ice dancing’s wild children through interviews with their friends, rivals and coaches.
