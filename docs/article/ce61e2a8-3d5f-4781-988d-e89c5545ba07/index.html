Abbey Gate is the central entry point for U.S. soldiers and has been for years, as well as a secure entry point for visitors to Afghanistan. Early reporting suggests the bomber approached the gate’s security checkpoint for entry and then detonated, presumably as they were being searched, surrounded by U.S. Marines and other Afghan civilians trying to get into the airport.</p><p>A few blocks away, at The Baron Hotel, another suicide bomber made their way to the crowded area — this one a favorite of defense contractors, journalists, businessmen and other Westerners — and then set off another explosion. Shortly after the blasts, gunmen opened fire on troops and civilians. Words like “complex” and “sophisticated” were floated to describe the bombings. The reported number of dead still varies, but most are in the ballpark of 100 Afghans killed, along with 12 U.S. service members (11 Marines and a Navy medic). At least another 150 Afghans and Americans were injured. It was one of the deadliest days in the history of the war in Afghanistan — not just in the last few months or the last year, but in the last 20 years.</p><p>In </p>...</source>
