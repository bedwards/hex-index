        <p>I am excited to present an interview with Tae Kim, author of the ”Nvidia Way”. A new book coming out on Tuesday Dec 10th in the US. I really enjoyed this book. You got to read it. It goes by fast and is hands-down the best history on Nvidia’s rise and its astounding culture.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg" width="1456" height="1848" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1848,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3620800,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KWqk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff040323b-75a3-4f74-aff0-62c17dbc6342_2898x3678.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Chris Miller … why not JON?!

Other than that it’s pretty much as I remember it.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>Jon:</strong></p><p><strong>Welcome to the show. I actually don't do a lot of these interviews, but I'm excited to make an exception. So welcome to the show Tae Kim. How are you doing?</strong></p><p>Tae Kim:</p><p>Good, good. Jon, thanks so much for having me. I'm so happy to be here.</p><p><strong>Jon:</strong></p><p><strong>Yeah. You have a very interesting book. And I just ripped through it. It was very fun. How did it get started and kind of what's the story behind it?</strong></p><p>Tae Kim:</p><p>I’ve been following NVIDIA for my whole life. From the 1990s, I was a PC gamer, building my own gaming PCs, and I’ve been following it. When I was on Wall Street, I invested in it at a hedge fund, so I’ve known NVIDIA from the early days. For the last 10 years, I’ve been in media—Yahoo Finance, CNBC, Barron’s, and Bloomberg Opinion—so I’ve been following it as a journalist also. I got an email in May of 2023. It was a cold email from an editor at Norton, and he said Matthew Ball, who wrote the famous Metaverse book, said that I could do a book on NVIDIA. Would I be interested in that? The first thing I did was ask, what’s Norton? I didn’t know Norton, and they’re actually a very well-regarded publishing house making books for Nobel Prize-winning academics and Ben Bernanke. The people in the newsroom were like, yeah, Norton’s a really big deal.</p><p>The second thing I did was go to Amazon. I said, there’s no way no one has written a book on NVIDIA. It’s the biggest chip designer by market cap in history. Every internet company in the world has multiple books on Amazon—Facebook, Apple, every major tech company. There was no book. I couldn’t believe it. No book on NVIDIA. I’ve been buying their graphics cards for 30 years. I know the business side, the finance side, and </p>...</source>
