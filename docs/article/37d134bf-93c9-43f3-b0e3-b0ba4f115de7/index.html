      <p>https://world.wng.org/2021/01/clampdown_on_democracy</p><p>If you have not read about what is going on in Hong Kong, let me encourage you to read this article in World Magazine. It's an update on the latest crackdowns attempted by the Communist Chinese party on the people of Hong Kong, and should give everyone around the world great continued and increasing concerns about the true intentions of the Communist Chinese Party. As Christians we should be praying repeatedly for our brothers and sisters in Hong Kong who are fighting for their freedoms, as we should also should be praying for all believers around the world and their peace, safety, and well being.</p>
