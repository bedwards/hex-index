        <p>Hi All,</p><p>For new readers, a word of warning. I often get things wrong. In fact I make sure to <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/phillipspobrien/p/looking-back-in-2023-and-forward?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">write a summary column at the end of each year which discusses things that I got wrong over the previous twelve months</a>. I am actually going to pre-empt that today because over the last few days/weeks its only become clear how I did not fully understand how the Trump con was working on Ukraine and Europe as a whole, and how important different elements were in governing administration thinking. </p><p>With the reporting of the last two weeks, I hope it is clear that the Trump administration has been <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/phillipspobrien/p/the-long-con-comes-to-an-end?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=web">playing a con game in its periodic pivots to look like they were going to support Ukraine</a> and hammer Russia. Indeed, the details of just how determined the Trump administration is to cut a deal with Russia (and make lots of money) has become clearer. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-u-s-peace-business-ties-4db9b290?st=PZyL2z&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">Business negotiations have been ongoing for months, according to the Wall Street Journal, as Trump and Putin have been discussing through intermediaries, the best way to mutually benefit from the relationship</a>.</p><h4><strong>Protecting Russian Assets So They Can Be Returned To Russia</strong></h4><p>The original 28-point plan agreed between the US and Russian governments, also made it clear how keen the US side was, at least, to get back to business with Russia.  And that reveals one are that I did not credit enough for being key in the con—protecting the approximately $300 billion of seized Russian assets from being used by European states to aid Ukraine.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg" width="1024" height="682" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:682,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev points while walking with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff in Moscow.&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev points while walking with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff in Moscow." title="Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev points while walking with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff in Moscow." srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qsgU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c63e525-ab24-4721-9051-27b7dedb4b25_1024x682.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and Kirill Dmitriev meeting in Moscow yesterday.

These funds would be invaluable to help Ukraine fight and then help Ukraine rebuild after the war. The US has always been ambivalent about this. However in January 2025, as the Biden Administration was preparing to leave, President Biden came out and said Russian assets should be given to Ukraine.</p><p>Making sure that this did not happen has been a huge priority of the Trump Administration and thus a huge part of the con. In Feb-March 2025, when the Trump administration came down like a ton of bricks on Ukraine, <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2025/02/25/europes-leaders-piling-pressure-eu-release-200-billion-frozen-russian-assets-fund-ukraine/">they seemed to help energize European leaders to push for Russian </a></p>...</source>
