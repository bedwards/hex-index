        <p>Last Minute Addition: As I went to send this out, I saw that a Dorothy book, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980296">The Autobiography of H. Lan Thao Lam</a> </em>by Lana Lim, is longlisted for the National Book Award for Nonfiction!! Congrats to all, and perfect timing for this piece . . . </p><div><hr></div><p>Below please find a piece that Martin Riker—author of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781566895286">Samuel Johnson's Eternal Return</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9780802160416">The Guest Lecture</a></em>, co-founder and co-publisher of <a href="https://dorothyproject.com/">Dorothy, a publishing project</a>, and former Dalkey Archive employee, all around great literary citizen—wrote about Dorothy’s latest publication, <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980272">The Endless Week</a> </em>by Laura Vazquez, translated from the French by Alex Niemi.</p><p>This is a book that I’ve been anticipating ever since it appeared on Dorothy’s website, and this piece only stokes those fires! </p><p>If you aren’t already familiar with Dorothy, you may want to spend some time (and money) with their <a href="https://dorothyproject.com/books-gallery/">catalog</a>.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a> They are truly one of the most elegant publishers out there, doing high-quality books in such a thoughtful, considered way. From the editing to the cover design to the modest way in which they drop these total bangers year in and year out—Dorothy is a testament to what small press publishing can be. </p><div><hr></div><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980272" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg" width="220" height="280" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:280,&quot;width&quot;:220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:29319,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980272&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://dalkeyarchive.substack.com/i/173214578?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ymgF!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa619de91-af29-48ba-b8e0-18b7b09f7b1a_220x280.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h4>On <em>The Endless Week</em> by Laura Vazquez</h4><h4>by Martin Riker</h4><p>I’d written to Chad to say how impressed I’ve been with this “Mining the Dalkey Archive” project. It’s one thing to relaunch a book—certainly Dalkey Archive has a long tradition of it—but trying to build a new audience for an entire backlist is a heavy lift, and this particular effort seems a model for how that sort of thing can be done.</p><p>So, I’d written to say I thought this series was great, but also to tell him about <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980272">The Endless Week</a></em> by Laura Vazquez, translated (very brilliantly) by Alex Niemi, a debut novel coming out from Dorothy, the press my wife Danielle and I run. I thought Chad would be interested because the novel makes me think, for different reasons, of a number of Dalkey books: Ourednik’s <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781628975017">Europeana</a></em>, Levé’s <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781564787071">Autoportrait</a></em> (a little). Also Gerald Murnane, in the sense that both writers seem to reinvent literature from the ground up. So when Chad turned around and asked if I wanted to write something about <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/164/9781948980272">The Endless Week</a></em> for “Mining the Dalkey Archive,” even though it is not a book published by Dalkey Archive, that made its own kind of sense.</p><p>There is </p>...</source>
