        <p>Here, I consider why there are woman-haters and man-haters, how the two are similar, and where both go wrong.</p><h2>1. Gender Resentment</h2><p>Many people harbor resentment or disdain towards the opposite sex. There are many women who basically think that men are bad—exploitative oppressors, always on the verge of committing rape and mayhem, chauvinistic, self-centered, etc. On the other hand, there are many men who basically think that women are bad—untrustworthy, gold-diggers, incompetent, mentally unstable, etc. Both groups commonly find the opposite sex to be cold-hearted and exploitative.</p><blockquote><p>Aside: “Men are exploitative” is an example of what they call a “generic” in philosophy of language, a generalization in which the quantifier is unspecified. (Are we talking about <em>all</em> men, <em>some</em> men, <em>most</em> men …?) Other examples include “dogs are smarter than cats” and “mosquitos carry the West Nile virus.” Often, it’s just a statement about averages or majorities, but not always. Only a small percentage of mosquitos actually carry West Nile, yet we can still say “mosquitos carry the virus.”</p><p>In our example: perhaps “men are exploitative” means that the frequency of exploitative behavior by men is more than one would expect, or significantly more than that found in women, or something like that.</p></blockquote><p>The callousness that the two sexes complain about tends to take different forms. Women tend to complain that men lie to get sex, pretend to be interested in a serious relationship, then leave as soon as they get sex. On the other hand, men complain that women cheat on their partners. </p><p>These things happen <em>partly</em> because there are differences in what each sex finds upsetting; thus, each sex fails to grasp how incredibly upsetting these behaviors are to the other sex. They also happen partly due to individuals <em>not caring</em> about others’ perspectives or what effect they have on other people.</p><h3>Misogyny</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp" width="614" height="521.4454912516824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:631,&quot;width&quot;:743,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:614,&quot;bytes&quot;:15278,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://fakenous.substack.com/i/185128333?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cp_F!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0bfe70ef-ebac-4454-8b69-c31a7d1a550d_743x631.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Andrew Tate</figcaption></figure></div><p>Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist with a large online following.
