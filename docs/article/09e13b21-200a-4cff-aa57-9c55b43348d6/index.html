        <p><em>Welcome back to Techno Sapiens! I’m Jacqueline Nesi, a psychology professor and mom of two (soon-to-be three!) young kids.</em></p><p><em>If you like Techno Sapiens, please consider sharing it with a friend today!</em></p><div><hr></div><h6><em><strong>7 min read</strong></em></h6><p>The spreadsheet has 40 rows and 8 columns. There’s a daily schedule, broken down into 15- and 30-minute increments. There are indications for school and activity drop-offs, plus assignment of tasks to various caregivers. There’s a section for notes, another for tracking extracurriculars, and another for outstanding questions. There are codes in the form of colors and abbreviations, and many—too many—question marks (<em>JN stay with baby? Date night? Need help with school pickups?</em>)</p><p>It’s late, and my husband and I are staring silently at the sheet on his laptop, our eyes glazing over the intersecting lines.</p><p><em>But even if we figure this out, </em>I start, <em>How are we going to remember all this? Do we have to check the spreadsheet everyday? Do we transfer it all to a calendar of some sort?</em></p><p>We keep staring.</p><p><em>And how do we track all the other stuff? Like, remembering show-and-tell on Wednesdays, or to pack up his swimsuit and towel and snack before swim lessons?</em></p><p>We stare some more.</p><p><em>And what happens when there’s a change in the schedule? What about doctor appointments? What if one of us needs to work late or can’t do our usual drop-off?</em></p><p>We kick around various systems, solutions, and strategies, but instead of landing on an answer, we end the night with a question.</p><p><em>How do people do this?!</em></p><h2><strong>Let’s get…Organized! Organized!</strong></h2><p>I know my family is not alone in the challenges of navigating new schedules, dividing up tasks, and managing the competing demands of work, childcare, and everything else.<a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" target="_self">1</a><a class="footnote-anchor" data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" target="_self">2</a> </p><p>Perhaps you are not married to a reformed investment banker, so your version involves a little less Excel. Or maybe you have older kids, and your version involves more extracurriculars and homework.</p><p>No matter, the question still remains: <em>how do people do this?!</em></p><p>As my husband and I grew stuck, muddling through increasingly complex equations of baby naps, carpools, and babysitters, I decided to kick things up a notch:</p><p>It was time to go to the research.</p><p>What, if anything, does the evidence say about organizing family life? Are there things we can learn from the research that might actually be helpful?</p><p>To my surprise, the answer was ...</p>
