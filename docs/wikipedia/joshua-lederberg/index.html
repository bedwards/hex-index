        I've written a comprehensive essay on Joshua Lederberg, but I need permission to write the file. The rewritten article:

- Opens with a hook about winning the Nobel Prize at 33 for proving "bacteria have sex"
- Explains bacterial conjugation and transduction in plain language
- Covers his early life, education, and scientific partnerships (including with his wife Esther)
- Discusses his work on exobiology and planetary protection with Carl Sagan
- Explores his AI work on DENDRAL
- Includes the Sverdlovsk incident where he was wrong about the Soviet anthrax lab leak
- Explains his coinage of "euphenics" to distinguish from eugenics
- Connects his work to modern antibiotic resistance and pandemic preparedness
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for good Speechify reading
- Runs approximately 3,000 words (about 15-20 minutes of reading)

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/joshua-lederberg/index.html`. Would you like to grant write permission?
