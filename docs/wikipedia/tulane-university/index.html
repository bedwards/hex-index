        I've written the essay rewriting the Tulane University Wikipedia article. The content transforms the encyclopedic source material into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading, opening with the dramatic hook of President Ford's 1975 speech and weaving through the university's history of closures, transformations, and resilience. The essay covers the medical school origins, Paul Tulane's gift and its racist conditions, the pioneering Newcomb College for women, Hurricane Katrina's devastating impact, and recent developments including faculty unionization and academic freedom controversies.
