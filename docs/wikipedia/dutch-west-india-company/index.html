<h2>The Corporation That Built Manhattan—and Enslaved Millions</h2>

<p>In 1626, a company purchased the island of Manhattan from the Lenape people for goods worth about sixty guilders. That company wasn't a government. It wasn't a king. It was a corporation—the Dutch West India Company—and its fingerprints are still visible on the streets of New York today.</p>

<p>But this wasn't just any company. The Dutch West India Company, known by its Dutch acronym GWC (for Geoctrooieerde Westindische Compagnie, meaning "Chartered West India Company"), was one of history's most powerful corporations. At its peak, it waged wars, colonized continents, and became one of the largest slave traders in the Atlantic world. When you walk through Greenwich Village today—once called the "Land of the Blacks" for its community of freed enslaved people—you're walking through the legacy of this strange and brutal enterprise.</p>

<h2>A Company Born From War</h2>

<p>The Dutch West India Company didn't emerge from some entrepreneurial vision. It was forged in the fires of an eighty-year war.</p>

<p>In 1621, the Dutch Republic had been fighting for independence from Spain for over fifty years. The conflict, known as the Dutch War of Independence, had shaped every aspect of Dutch society. Trade, religion, politics—everything filtered through this existential struggle against the Spanish crown.</p>

<p>For twelve years, from 1609 to 1621, the two sides had observed an uneasy truce. During those years, Spain had made one thing abundantly clear: they would only agree to permanent peace if the Dutch stayed out of the Americas and Asia. Spain and Portugal—united under a single crown at the time—considered the Western Hemisphere their territory, divided between them by the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. The Dutch trading in their waters? Unacceptable.</p>

<p>Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, the Grand Pensionary who essentially served as the Dutch Republic's chief diplomat, had agreed to suspend plans for a West India Company in exchange for the truce. But when the truce expired in April 1621, Oldenbarnevelt was already dead—beheaded in 1619 after losing a power struggle with Stadtholder Maurice of Orange.</p>

<p>Maurice wanted to resume the war. And he wanted a weapon.</p>

<p>Within weeks of the truce's expiration, the Dutch West India Company received its charter.</p>

<h2>A Monopoly on Half the World</h2>

<p>The charter granted to the GWC in June 1621 was breathtaking in its scope. The company received a twenty-four-year monopoly on all Dutch trade and colonization from Newfoundland in the north to the Straits of Magellan in the south—essentially the entire Western Hemisphere. It also controlled the West African coast, from the Tropic of Cancer down to the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>This wasn't just a trading company. The charter gave the GWC the power to make treaties, build fortresses, and administer justice in its territories. It was, in effect, a state within a state.</p>

<p>The Dutch had already created a similar monster. The Dutch East India Company, or VOC (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie), had been founded in 1602 to handle trade with Asia. It had become fantastically profitable, paying dividends that averaged eighteen percent annually for nearly two centuries. The GWC was meant to replicate that success in the Atlantic world.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: investors weren't interested.</p>

<h2>A Hard Sell</h2>

<p>When the GWC opened for investment in 1621, the response was tepid. The VOC had been a gold mine, but the West India Company looked like a money pit. Its charter explicitly anticipated warfare with Spain. Shareholders would be funding a military campaign as much as a trading venture.</p>

<p>The States-General—the governing body of the Dutch Republic—had to lean on municipalities and institutions to invest. Even then, complaints circulated that the company was a "racket" designed to provide "cushy posts for the directors and their relatives, at the expense of ordinary shareholders." Sound familiar?</p>

<p>The VOC's directors invested in the GWC without consulting their own shareholders, causing outrage. To attract foreign capital, the company offered equal standing to investors from France, Switzerland, and Venice. By 1623, the GWC had raised 2.8 million florins—substantial, but less than half of the VOC's original capitalization of 6.5 million.</p>

<p>The company was structured similarly to its eastern counterpart. It had five regional chambers, with Amsterdam and Middelburg contributing the most. A board of nineteen directors—the Heeren XIX, or "Nineteen Gentlemen"—governed the enterprise. This was a deliberate echo of the VOC's Heeren XVII, the "Seventeen Gentlemen" who controlled the East India trade.</p>

<p>There was one crucial difference, though. Unlike the VOC, the GWC had no explicit authority to deploy military troops. It would have to find other ways to wage war.</p>

<h2>The Grand Design</h2>

<p>The company's first strategy was ambitious. The Groot Desseyn—the "Grand Design"—aimed to seize Portuguese colonies in Africa and Brazil, giving the Dutch control over the sugar trade and, crucially, the slave trade that powered it.</p>

<p>This plan failed.</p>

<p>The company pivoted to something more opportunistic: piracy. Or, as the Dutch politely called it, "privateering"—state-sanctioned theft from enemy ships. Nearly every GWC vessel carried forty to fifty soldiers, ostensibly for defense but available for "hijacking enemy ships" as needed.</p>

<p>In the late 1620s, this approach struck gold. Literally.</p>

<h2>The Greatest Heist in History</h2>

<p>Piet Heyn was already a legend before 1628. He had been captured by the Spanish as a young man, spent four years as a galley slave, and had developed a deep, personal hatred for his former captors. When he became an admiral in the GWC fleet, he turned that hatred into strategy.</p>

<p>In September 1628, Heyn accomplished something that no one had done before—or would ever do again. He captured the entire Spanish silver fleet.</p>

<p>This was not some ragtag convoy. The silver fleet was Spain's economic lifeline, carrying precious metals from the mines of Mexico and Peru back to Europe. The treasure Heyn seized was worth approximately eleven million guilders—equivalent to billions in today's currency. It was, proportionally, one of the largest heists in human history.</p>

<p>Heyn also seized sugar from Brazil and a galleon from Honduras loaded with cacao, indigo, and other valuable goods. When news reached the Netherlands, the country erupted in celebration. Heyn became a national hero, and the GWC paid out a fifty percent dividend—an almost unheard-of return.</p>

<p>But the company's directors understood something important: you can't build a business on lightning striking twice. Piracy was profitable, but unpredictable. They returned to the original vision.</p>

<p>They would take Brazil.</p>

<h2>Dutch Brazil: A Sugar Empire</h2>

<p>In 1630, a GWC fleet captured Olinda and Pernambuco in northeastern Brazil. Over the next several years, the company expanded its holdings to create Dutch Brazil—a colony they called New Holland, with its capital at Mauritsstad (present-day Recife).</p>

<p>This was sugar country. The Portuguese had transformed Brazil's northeast into the world's largest sugar producer, and the GWC wanted that wealth. But sugar cultivation had a terrible requirement: labor. Backbreaking, lethal labor in the fields and mills, performed under the tropical sun.</p>

<p>The solution, in the brutal logic of the age, was slavery.</p>

<p>The Dutch had been dabbling in the slave trade since the early 1600s. Now, with sugar plantations to feed, they industrialized it. The GWC captured the Portuguese slave trading posts in West Africa—including Elmina Castle in present-day Ghana, which would become their main port—and began shipping human beings across the Atlantic in unprecedented numbers.</p>

<p>But holding Brazil proved harder than taking it.</p>

<h2>The Long Defeat</h2>

<p>The Portuguese colonists in Brazil never accepted Dutch rule. A resistance movement, drawing support from indigenous allies and the Portuguese crown, fought back relentlessly. The war drained the GWC's resources year after year.</p>

<p>By 1636, the company was technically bankrupt. It staggered on, but the situation grew increasingly desperate. Amsterdam—the wealthiest city in the Netherlands and the largest investor in the GWC—began to lose interest. The city had extensive trade relationships with Portugal and didn't want to jeopardize them over a colonial adventure that seemed increasingly doomed.</p>

<p>The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe, made things worse. The treaty forbade the GWC from attacking Spanish shipping, eliminating one of its few reliable revenue streams.</p>

<p>In 1654, the Portuguese recaptured Recife. Dutch Brazil was finished.</p>

<h2>Meanwhile, Up North</h2>

<p>While the company was bleeding money in Brazil, something quieter was happening in North America.</p>

<p>In 1609, the English explorer Henry Hudson—employed by the Dutch East India Company—had sailed up the river that now bears his name, looking for a Northwest Passage to Asia. He didn't find one, but he did find a region rich in beaver pelts. The GWC established trading posts there, and in 1626 purchased Manhattan from its indigenous inhabitants.</p>

<p>The colony was called New Netherland. Its capital was New Amsterdam, located at the southern tip of Manhattan where the East River meets the Hudson. Other settlements spread across what would become New York, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey.</p>

<p>The GWC tried to attract settlers through a system of patroonships—essentially feudal land grants. Investors who brought fifty settlers to the colony could claim vast tracts of land and govern them with considerable autonomy. It was a medieval solution to a modern problem, and it mostly failed. Colonists didn't want to be peasants on someone else's estate.</p>

<p>Only one patroonship truly succeeded: Rensselaerswyck, near present-day Albany. Its owner, Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, managed to build a functioning colony while others floundered.</p>

<p>New Netherland would never be the jewel the GWC hoped for. In 1664, an English fleet sailed into the harbor and took the colony without a fight. New Amsterdam became New York, named for the Duke of York, who would later become King James II.</p>

<p>But the Dutch left their mark. Wall Street takes its name from the wall the Dutch built at the northern edge of their settlement. Broadway follows the path of a Dutch road. The Bowery comes from bouwerij, the Dutch word for farm. And that community of freed enslaved people in Greenwich Village—the "Land of the Blacks"—had its origins in the peculiar manumission practices of the GWC, which sometimes freed slaves who had served the company for many years.</p>

<h2>The Slave Trade Company</h2>

<p>The first Dutch West India Company died in 1674, unable to pay its debts. But something remarkable happened: it was immediately reborn.</p>

<p>The demand for slaves in the Americas was too great, and the Dutch infrastructure too valuable, to simply abandon. A second company—often called the New West India Company—received a charter that same year. It inherited all the ships, fortresses, and personnel of its predecessor.</p>

<p>What it didn't inherit was the pretense of empire-building.</p>

<p>The new GWC focused almost entirely on the slave trade. It had lost Brazil, lost New Netherland, lost most of its territorial ambitions. What it retained were its West African trading posts and its relationships with the Spanish crown, which granted the company asiento contracts—licenses to supply enslaved Africans to Spanish colonies.</p>

<p>In 1662, the GWC had obtained contracts to deliver 24,000 enslaved Africans to the Spanish Americas. The company made Curaçao—a small island in the Caribbean that the Dutch still control today—into a massive slave trading hub. Ships brought captives from West Africa to Curaçao, where they were "processed" and sold to buyers from across the Caribbean and Spanish Main.</p>

<p>By 1687, thanks to these contracts, the company paid its highest dividend ever. The money was soaked in blood, but the shareholders didn't care.</p>

<h2>The Long Twilight</h2>

<p>The second GWC lasted more than a century, but it was never the titan its predecessor had aspired to be. It was a slave trading company with some Caribbean islands and a few African outposts—profitable enough to survive, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784) delivered the final blow. The British captured most of the company's remaining assets. By 1792, the GWC was dissolved, its remnants absorbed into the Dutch state.</p>

<p>The company that had purchased Manhattan, conquered Brazil, and shipped hundreds of thousands of Africans into bondage simply ceased to exist. No dramatic collapse, no final battle. Just an accounting entry and a transfer of assets.</p>

<h2>The Shadow on the Streets</h2>

<p>Walk through New York today and you're walking through the GWC's legacy. The street grid of lower Manhattan, the place names, the very existence of the city—all trace back to a corporation founded four centuries ago to wage economic war on Spain.</p>

<p>But there's a darker legacy too. The Dutch West India Company was one of the largest slave traders in history. It helped build the infrastructure of the Atlantic slave trade—the ships, the fortresses, the Caribbean processing centers—that would continue for another century after the company's demise. When American slavery finally ended in 1865, it was dismantling a system the GWC had helped create.</p>

<p>That neighborhood in Greenwich Village, the one that was once called "Little Africa," holds both parts of this story. It was home to freed slaves, yes—but they were freed from a slavery that the Dutch had imported in the first place. The company that built New Amsterdam also built the auction blocks.</p>

<p>This is the strange, uncomfortable truth about corporations like the GWC. They could be vehicles for exploration and settlement, for trade and innovation. But they could also be vehicles for conquest and enslavement, for extraction and exploitation. Often, they were both at once—and the people who invested in them, who profited from them, didn't have to think too hard about which was which.</p>

<p>The Dutch West India Company has been gone for more than two centuries. But its shadow still falls on streets from Manhattan to Curaçao, from Recife to Accra. We're still living in the world it helped make.</p>
