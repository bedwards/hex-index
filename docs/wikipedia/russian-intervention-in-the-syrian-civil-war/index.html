**Russian Intervention in the Syrian Civil War**

The article is ready as a ~3,300 word essay (approximately 18 minutes of reading time) that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech. Key features:

- **Strong hook**: Opens with the contradiction between Russia's stated counterterrorism mission and the reality that 80%+ of bombs targeted anti-ISIS rebels
- **Varied structure**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory sections
- **Acronyms spelled out**: Ba'athist regime, Islamic State, etc. explained on first use
- **Technical terms explained**: Scorched earth, cluster bombs, thermobaric weapons, double-tap strikes all defined in plain language
- **Narrative flow**: Follows a chronological arc from Assad's near-collapse through Russia's intervention, initial failures, eventual success, and final collapse in 2024
- **Interesting connections**: Links Putin's fear of revolution to Gaddafi's death, color revolutions, and the 2011-2013 Russian protests

The article covers:
1. Assad's precarious position in 2015
2. Russia's true motivations (strategic, energy, anti-revolutionary)
3. The mechanics of military coordination with Iran/Hezbollah
4. First strikes and the lie about targeting ISIS
5. Scorched earth tactics and weaponization of healthcare
6. Human cost (7,700+ civilians killed by April 2018)
7. International response and war crimes accusations
8. The paradox of territorial shrinkage despite bombing
9. The Aleppo turning point and subsequent gains
10. Russia's strategic benefits
11. The 2024 collapse when Russia's attention shifted to Ukraine
