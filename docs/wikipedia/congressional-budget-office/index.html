        I've written a comprehensive essay about the Congressional Budget Office that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the CBO's role as "scorekeeper" of government spending
- Explains the Nixon-era constitutional crisis that led to its creation
- Describes how the scorekeeping process works and why it matters
- Explores the "nonpartisan paradox" - how an agency attacked by both parties maintains credibility
- Covers the institutional design and culture that protects independence
- Includes the California connection and international influence
- Discusses the limits and constraints of budget forecasting
- Examines the CBO vs OMB dynamic
- Concludes with why this matters for democracy
