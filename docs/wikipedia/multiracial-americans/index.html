        I've prepared a comprehensive rewrite of the Multiracial Americans Wikipedia article. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging ~18 minute read optimized for Speechify text-to-speech.

Key features of the rewrite:
- Opens with the dramatic 276% population increase statistic as a hook
- Explores the hidden history of interracial relationships from colonial times
- Explains the legal principle of *partus sequitur ventrem* and how it enabled exploitation
- Covers the Thomas Jefferson/Sally Hemings story in accessible detail
- Explains the one-drop rule and its connection to eugenics
- Tells the Loving v. Virginia story compellingly
- Discusses Obama's election as a multiracial watershed moment
- Addresses the philosophical question of "who counts as multiracial"
- Provides current statistics with context
- Closes with thoughtful reflection on what visibility and recognition mean

The HTML follows the existing template structure from other Wikipedia pages in your library. I need file write permission to save it to `docs/wikipedia/multiracial-americans/index.html`.
