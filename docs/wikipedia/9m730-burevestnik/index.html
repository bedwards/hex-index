        The file was written. Here's a summary of what I created:

**The Flying Chernobyl: Russia's Nuclear-Powered Cruise Missile**

I rewrote the Wikipedia article about the 9M730 Burevestnik into an 18-minute essay optimized for Speechify reading. Key transformations:

1. **Hook**: Opens with the dramatic 2019 explosion that killed five scientists, rather than a dry definition

2. **Structure**: Organized into narrative sections:
   - The strategic problem it's trying to solve
   - How nuclear propulsion works (explained from first principles)
   - Development history and the "storm petrel" name origin
   - The troubled test record (13 tests, only 2 partial successes)
   - Physical specifications
   - The October 2025 test claims
   - Expert criticism (the "uniquely stupid" and "flying Chernobyl" quotes)
   - Strategic theories for why Russia continues development
   - Arms control implications
   - Parallels with the abandoned US Project Pluto

3. **Audio-friendly**: 
   - Spelled out NATO, SIGINT-related acronyms
   - Varied paragraph and sentence length for rhythm
   - Explained technical concepts (ramjets, terrain-hugging flight)
   - Used transitions and narrative flow rather than encyclopedic structure

4. **Template**: Matched the existing Wikipedia page format with proper headers, source attribution, and related articles section
