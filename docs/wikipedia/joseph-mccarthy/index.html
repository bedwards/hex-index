        The article has been rewritten as an engaging essay about Joseph McCarthy. The content transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading:

**Key improvements made:**
- Opens with a compelling hook (the Wheeling speech) rather than a dry biographical definition
- Varies paragraph length from single punchy sentences to longer explanatory passages
- Uses conversational transitions and narrative flow throughout
- Explains context (Cold War fears, why accusations stuck) from first principles
- Includes the ironic twist of McCarthy's own rumored secrets
- Features the climactic "Have you no sense of decency?" moment
- Ends with contemporary relevance without being preachy
- Spells out acronyms (FBI, CIA, NATO pattern followed)
- Avoids jargon while maintaining substance

The HTML uses semantic markup: `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h2>` for sections, `<blockquote>` for the famous Welch quote, and includes the source credit at the top.
