        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Wikipedia article about Alice B. Toklas. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about her ironic fame for the hashish fudge recipe she didn't write
- Traces her life from San Francisco to Paris, with the remarkable detail that she met Stein the day after arriving
- Explores the dynamics of the Stein-Toklas partnership and their famous salon
- Explains the literary joke of Stein's "Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas"
- Covers their wartime experiences, including driving ambulances in WWI
- Details the tragic aftermath of Stein's death, when Toklas lost the art collection
- Unpacks the cookbook's unlikely cultural impact
- Ends with James Merrill's beautiful description of her voice as "a viola at dusk"

The essay is approximately 3,000 words, suitable for 15-20 minutes of audio reading. It uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural speech rhythm, and explains concepts from first principles without assuming prior knowledge.
