        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article about the postpartum period, transforming it from encyclopedic reference material into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. 

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about the WHO's characterization of this period as both critical and neglected
- Explains the three phases (acute, subacute, delayed) in accessible terms
- Covers the major topics: postpartum bleeding, skin-to-skin contact, blood clots, lochia, afterpains, breastfeeding, sleep deprivation, urinary incontinence, mental health challenges, and long-term recovery
- Includes the striking statistic about U.S. maternity leave policy compared to other developed nations
- Discusses postpartum confinement traditions across cultures
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for better audio flow
- Spells out acronyms (ACOG, DVT, FMLA, etc.) on first use
- Avoids jargon or explains technical terms when necessary

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/postpartum-period/index.html` once you grant write permission.
