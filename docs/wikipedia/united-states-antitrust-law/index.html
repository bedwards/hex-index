<h2>The War Against Economic Power</h2>

<p>In 1911, the most powerful company in America was ordered to destroy itself.</p>

<p>Standard Oil, the petroleum empire built by John D. Rockefeller, controlled roughly ninety percent of American oil refining. The company had achieved this dominance through a combination of ruthless efficiency and outright bullying—secret rebate deals with railroads that crushed competitors, economic threats that forced smaller refiners to sell or perish. When the Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil had to break itself into thirty-four separate companies, it wasn't just a legal decision. It was a declaration that in America, no business would be allowed to accumulate unchecked economic power.</p>

<p>That case established a principle that Americans have been arguing about ever since: how much should the government interfere with businesses in order to protect competition itself?</p>

<h2>Why "Antitrust" Is a Misleading Name</h2>

<p>The term sounds strange to modern ears. What do trusts have to do with monopolies?</p>

<p>In the late nineteenth century, clever industrialists discovered a legal loophole. A "trust" was traditionally just an arrangement where you gave someone else control over your property to manage for your benefit—like a trustee managing an inheritance. But American business titans realized they could use this mechanism to consolidate entire industries. Competing companies would hand over their stock to a single board of trustees, who would then coordinate all their activities. The companies remained technically separate, but they acted as one giant entity.</p>

<p>These "corporate trusts" became the vehicle for building monopolies in oil, steel, railroads, and sugar. The word entered the public vocabulary as a synonym for dangerous concentrations of corporate power. When Congress finally acted to address the problem, they called their solution "antitrust" law—literally, a law against trusts.</p>

<p>The trusts themselves disappeared in the early twentieth century as states made it easier to simply create large corporations directly. But the name stuck. Most of the world now calls this area of law "competition law" or "anti-monopoly law," which are more descriptive. Americans, characteristically, kept the original nineteenth-century terminology.</p>

<h2>The Three Pillars</h2>

<p>American antitrust law rests on three major statutes, each addressing a different threat to competition.</p>

<p>The Sherman Act of 1890 was the original weapon. Section 1 attacks coordination—when competitors secretly agree to fix prices, divide up markets, or boycott other businesses. Section 2 attacks domination—when a single company uses its power to crush or exclude competitors. Both sections are written in sweeping language that outlaws "every contract, combination, or conspiracy in restraint of trade" and prohibits anyone from monopolizing "any part of trade or commerce."</p>

<p>This broad wording was intentional but immediately created problems. Taken literally, even a simple business partnership restrains trade by combining two competitors. Courts quickly recognized they couldn't enforce the law as written without making ordinary commerce illegal.</p>

<p>The Clayton Act of 1914 provided more specific rules. It targeted mergers and acquisitions that might "substantially lessen competition"—stopping monopolies before they formed rather than waiting until a company had already achieved dominance. It also carved out an important exception: workers organizing into unions wouldn't be treated as an illegal combination, even though collective bargaining is technically a form of price-fixing for labor.</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission Act, also from 1914, created a new enforcement agency with broad power to prohibit "unfair methods of competition." The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, shares responsibility for enforcing antitrust law with the Justice Department, but operates independently and can act more flexibly.</p>

<h2>The Rule of Reason</h2>

<p>When the Supreme Court decided the Standard Oil case, it established something called the "rule of reason." Despite what the Sherman Act's text said about banning "every" restraint of trade, the Court held that only "unreasonable" restraints were actually illegal. Most business practices would be evaluated case by case, looking at their actual effects on competition.</p>

<p>Some practices, however, were deemed so obviously harmful that no case-by-case analysis was needed. These became "per se" illegal—meaning illegal in themselves, regardless of circumstances. Price-fixing between competitors was the clearest example. If two companies agreed to charge the same prices, that agreement was criminal, full stop. No court would entertain arguments about why the price-fixing might have been beneficial.</p>

<p>This distinction between "rule of reason" analysis and "per se" illegality became central to how antitrust law works. The category something falls into often determines whether the defendant has any real chance of winning.</p>

<h2>The Tides of Enforcement</h2>

<p>Having laws on the books means nothing without the will to enforce them. American antitrust enforcement has swung dramatically over the decades, driven by changing economic philosophies and political priorities.</p>

<p>For the first decade after the Sherman Act passed, almost nothing happened. Presidents and attorneys general showed little interest in going after big business. The law gathered dust while a massive wave of industrial mergers swept through the economy in the late 1890s and early 1900s.</p>

<p>The Progressive Era changed this. Theodore Roosevelt earned his reputation as a "trust-buster" by directing the Justice Department to sue forty-five companies during his presidency. His successor William Howard Taft was even more aggressive, targeting ninety companies. The Standard Oil breakup came during this period of heightened enforcement.</p>

<p>Then came World War I, which taught American leaders that close collaboration between government and business could efficiently coordinate economic production. Many abandoned their suspicion of corporate cooperation. After the Wall Street crash of 1929, some gave up on free market competition entirely, advocating for centralized economic planning instead. The Supreme Court's decisions during this era reflected these shifting attitudes, taking what one scholar called a "largely tolerant" view toward agreements between competitors.</p>

<h2>The Structuralist Revolution</h2>

<p>By the late 1930s, the pendulum swung back hard.</p>

<p>President Franklin Roosevelt's advisors, influenced by economists who argued that reviving competition was essential for recovery from the Great Depression, convinced him to appoint aggressive "trustbusting" lawyers to the Justice Department. This intellectual shift transformed how courts approached antitrust cases.</p>

<p>American judges began following what's called a "structuralist" approach. They focused obsessively on market concentration—how many competitors existed and how much market share each controlled. High concentration was treated as inherently suspicious. Courts gave little weight to arguments that mergers or business practices might create efficiencies that benefited consumers.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's 1940 decision in the Socony-Vacuum case exemplified this approach. Oil refiners had agreed to buy up surplus gasoline from independent refineries, claiming they were just recreating government programs that had stabilized the industry during the Depression. The Court refused to consider these justifications. Price-fixing agreements between competitors were per se illegal—period. The Court expanded per se illegality to cover more and more business practices: tying arrangements where you could only buy one product if you also bought another, agreements dividing up territories, collective boycotts.</p>

<p>Merger enforcement became especially strict after Congress passed the Celler-Kefauver Act in 1950. Courts blocked mergers even when the combined company would control only a small fraction of the market. In one famous 1962 case, the Supreme Court prohibited a merger that would have given the resulting company just five percent market share. Justice Potter Stewart, dissenting in a 1966 case, complained that the only consistent pattern he could find in merger law was that "the Government always wins."</p>

<h2>The Chicago Revolution</h2>

<p>Beginning in the 1970s, everything changed again.</p>

<p>A group of economists and legal scholars, many associated with the University of Chicago, launched a sustained intellectual assault on the structuralist approach. Their arguments were sophisticated and grounded in rigorous economic analysis.</p>

<p>The Chicago school pointed out that many practices courts had condemned as anticompetitive actually had perfectly innocent explanations. A company that locked customers into long-term contracts might be trying to crush competitors—or it might be protecting investments it needed to make to serve those customers well. A manufacturer that required retailers to maintain minimum prices might be stifling competition—or it might be preventing free-riding by discount stores on the marketing efforts of full-service retailers.</p>

<p>Game theory, a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions, showed that the same business practice could be either harmful or beneficial depending on context. Bright-line rules that treated certain conduct as automatically illegal would inevitably catch some behavior that was actually good for consumers.</p>

<p>Scholars like Robert Bork, Richard Posner, and Frank Easterbrook translated these economic insights into legal arguments that judges could understand and apply. All three later became influential federal appellate judges themselves, implementing the ideas they had championed as academics.</p>

<p>The economic struggles of the 1970s—the oil crisis, stagflation, and the recession of 1973 to 1975—made American policymakers receptive to arguments that overzealous antitrust enforcement was handicapping American companies competing against foreign rivals. Courts began pulling back.</p>

<p>The pivotal moment came in 1977, when the Supreme Court decided a case involving television manufacturers and their distribution contracts. In language that explicitly drew on Chicago school scholarship, the Court ruled that non-price restrictions in distribution agreements should be evaluated under the rule of reason, not treated as per se illegal. Over the following decades, more and more business practices were moved out of the per se category into rule-of-reason analysis, where defendants actually had a chance to defend themselves.</p>

<h2>The Microsoft Saga</h2>

<p>The late 1990s brought the most dramatic antitrust confrontation since the Standard Oil era.</p>

<p>Microsoft dominated the personal computer industry through its Windows operating system, which ran on the vast majority of the world's computers. When the internet exploded into mainstream use, Microsoft perceived Netscape's web browser as an existential threat—a platform that could potentially make the underlying operating system irrelevant. The company responded with a campaign of aggressive tactics to crush Netscape and maintain its monopoly.</p>

<p>A coalition of nineteen states and the federal Justice Department sued. The trial, held in Washington's federal district court, became a public spectacle. Internal Microsoft emails revealed executives casually discussing how to "cut off Netscape's air supply." The company had pressured computer manufacturers to exclude Netscape, tied its own browser to Windows in ways that made removing it nearly impossible, and punished business partners who failed to cooperate.</p>

<p>The trial judge found Microsoft guilty of illegal monopolization and ordered the company broken in two. But Microsoft appealed, and the appeals court, while affirming that Microsoft had violated the law, overturned the breakup order. It also removed the trial judge from the case after discovering he had been giving interviews to journalists while the trial was ongoing—a serious breach of judicial ethics.</p>

<p>With a new judge and a new presidential administration less interested in aggressive enforcement, Microsoft settled. The company agreed to modify some of its practices but remained intact. Critics complained the case showed that even proven antitrust violations resulted in minimal consequences. Defenders argued the litigation had constrained Microsoft's behavior enough to allow space for new competitors like Google to emerge.</p>

<h2>The Eternal Debate</h2>

<p>What is antitrust law actually for?</p>

<p>This question sounds simple but has no agreed-upon answer. Different answers lead to radically different enforcement approaches.</p>

<p>One influential view, associated with the Chicago school, holds that antitrust law should focus exclusively on consumer welfare. The only relevant question is whether a business practice raises prices or reduces output for consumers. If a merger creates a more efficient company that can offer lower prices, it should be allowed—even if it eliminates competitors and creates a dominant firm. Competition is valued not for its own sake but only as a means to benefit consumers.</p>

<p>A competing view holds that antitrust law serves broader purposes. Concentrated economic power threatens democracy by giving a few corporations outsized political influence. It harms workers by reducing their employment options. It stifles innovation by allowing dominant firms to buy up or crush potential disruptors. It damages communities by giving distant corporate headquarters power over local economies. On this view, protecting the competitive process itself—maintaining an economy with many independent decision-makers—matters beyond just consumer prices.</p>

<p>Some economists go further, arguing that antitrust enforcement actually harms the economy. Regulations that restrict mergers or business practices, they contend, prevent companies from achieving efficiencies that would benefit everyone. The threat of antitrust liability discourages firms from competing aggressively or investing in growth. In this view, the cure is worse than the disease.</p>

<p>Despite this disagreement, surveys of professional economists consistently show strong support for antitrust enforcement. A 1990 survey found that seventy-two percent of American Economic Association members agreed that large firms in the United States were likely to engage in collusive behavior. By 2021, eighty-five percent agreed that "corporate economic power has become too concentrated." Whatever their theoretical disagreements, most economists believe the real-world threat of monopoly power justifies an active enforcement regime.</p>

<h2>How It Works Today</h2>

<p>Modern American antitrust enforcement operates through multiple channels.</p>

<p>The Justice Department's Antitrust Division handles criminal enforcement—prosecuting executives who engage in price-fixing or bid-rigging cartels. It also brings civil cases challenging mergers and monopolistic behavior. The FTC shares civil enforcement authority and can act through its own administrative proceedings as well as federal court.</p>

<p>Private parties who have been harmed by antitrust violations can sue for damages—and if they win, they're entitled to three times their actual losses, a powerful incentive that encourages private enforcement. Many significant antitrust cases are brought by competitors or customers, not the government.</p>

<p>States can enforce their own antitrust laws within their borders and can join federal enforcement actions. The Microsoft case, notably, was brought by states alongside the federal government.</p>

<p>Most merger challenges never reach trial. Companies proposing large mergers must notify the government in advance and wait for review. If regulators object, companies often abandon the merger or agree to conditions—like selling off certain business units—rather than face prolonged litigation.</p>

<h2>The Stakes for Tech</h2>

<p>Today's antitrust debates center heavily on the technology industry.</p>

<p>A handful of companies—Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft—have achieved dominance that rivals or exceeds the industrial titans of a century ago. They control platforms that other businesses depend on to reach customers. They accumulate data that reinforces their advantages and creates barriers for potential competitors. They acquire nascent rivals before they can grow into threats.</p>

<p>Whether and how to address this concentration has become one of the most contested questions in American economic policy. Critics argue that existing antitrust frameworks, designed for an industrial economy, fail to address the distinctive features of digital platform competition. Defenders counter that the same principles apply—market power is market power, whether exercised by a railroad or a search engine.</p>

<p>The outcome of this debate will shape not just the technology industry but the broader economy for decades to come. It will determine whether the American economic model continues to feature genuinely competitive markets or evolves into something more oligopolistic—a handful of dominant platforms managing their respective domains.</p>

<p>That's ultimately what antitrust law has always been about: deciding how much power any single company should be allowed to accumulate in a democratic society. Americans have answered that question differently in different eras. How the current generation answers it remains an open question.</p>
