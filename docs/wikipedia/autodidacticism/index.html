        The essay has been written. It transforms the Wikipedia article on autodidacticism into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify. Key features:

- **Hook-first structure** - Opens with the striking Stack Overflow statistic about self-taught developers
- **Varied rhythm** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones
- **Spelled-out terms** - "Massive Open Online Courses, known as MOOCs"
- **First-principles explanations** - Breaks down Greek etymology, explains heutagogy vs andragogy
- **Narrative flow** - Traces autodidacticism from James Watt through Ibn Tufail to modern online learning
- **Clean semantic HTML** - Uses proper `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<em>` tags for Speechify compatibility

The rewrite maintains all the substantive content from the source—the historical context, philosophical frameworks, famous autodidacts, and modern developments—while making it flow naturally as spoken audio.
