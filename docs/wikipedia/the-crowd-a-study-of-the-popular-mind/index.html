        I've written the essay but need permission to save it. The rewritten article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay about Gustave Le Bon's 1895 book "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind." 

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about what happens to rational individuals when they join crowds
- Explains Le Bon's core thesis about crowd psychology and the "hypnotic" effect of masses
- Contextualizes the book's troubling influence on both Freud and Hitler/Mussolini
- Critically examines Le Bon's elitism and racial pseudoscience while acknowledging valid observations
- Connects the historical material to modern relevance (online mobs, democratic deliberation)
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for Speechify compatibility
- Avoids jargon and explains terms like "bimetallism" when they appear

Would you like me to proceed with saving the file once permissions are granted?
