        I've written a complete essay on Armen Alchian, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about Alchian cracking a nuclear secret through stock price analysis
- Tells the story of his Armenian immigrant family background
- Explains his transformation of UCLA's economics department
- Details his key contributions: property rights economics, evolutionary theory of markets, and the theory of the firm
- Translates technical economic concepts into accessible language
- Includes the colorful golf-as-capitalism anecdote
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for good audio rhythm
- Runs approximately 3,400 words (about 15-20 minutes of reading)

The file is ready to write to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/armen-alchian/index.html` once you grant write permission for that directory.
