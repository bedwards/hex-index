        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Venetian Patent Statute. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with a compelling hook about what the 1474 senators accomplished
- Explains the guild system and why patents were revolutionary
- Includes the key quote from the original statute
- Explores why Venice was uniquely positioned to create this system
- Tells the story of Brunelleschi's ill-fated cargo boat
- Presents the statistical evidence for the statute's impact
- Addresses the scholarly debate about codification vs. creation
- Traces how the idea spread to England and America
- Clarifies what patents are not (not property, not rewards for effort, not secrets)
- Concludes with Venice's enduring legacy

The content is approximately 2,400 words, suitable for about 15-20 minutes of reading with Speechify. It uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for good audio rhythm, and explains concepts from first principles without assuming prior knowledge.
