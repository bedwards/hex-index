        I've written the rewritten miso article. Here's the content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miso">Wikipedia: Miso</a></p>

<p>In feudal Japan, a bowl of miso soup could mean the difference between a peasant who lived through winter and one who didn't. This humble fermented paste, made from soybeans and salt and a particular mold, provided protein to a population that ate almost no meat. Samurai carried it as military rations. Monks discovered new ways to use it. And today, more than half of all Japanese people eat it every single day.</p>

<p>But what exactly is miso? And why has something that looks like muddy peanut butter become one of the world's most sophisticated fermented foods?</p>

<h2>A Fungus Makes the Magic</h2>

<p>At its core, miso is simple. You take soybeans, add salt, and introduce a fungus called Aspergillus oryzae—known in Japanese as kōji. Then you wait. Sometimes for five days. Sometimes for several years.</p>

<p>That's the basic formula. But like so many simple things, the execution is where art meets science.</p>

<p>Aspergillus oryzae is a mold, and before you recoil at that word, consider this: it's one of the most beneficial fungi humans have ever cultivated. The Japanese government has designated it a "national fungus," and for good reason. Without it, there would be no miso, no soy sauce, no sake, no mirin. An entire cuisine depends on these microscopic spores.</p>

<p>The mold does something remarkable. It produces enzymes—biological catalysts that break down complex molecules into simpler ones. Amylase enzymes chop up starches into sugars. Protease enzymes dismantle proteins into amino acids. When these enzymes go to work on soybeans and grains, they create an explosion of flavors that neither ingredient possesses on its own.</p>

<p>One of those amino acids is glutamate. You might know its sodium salt better: monosodium glutamate, or MSG, the flavor enhancer that sparked decades of unfounded health panics. But the glutamate in miso is different from the pure crystalline powder in a shaker. Miso contains dozens of amino acids and fermentation byproducts, all working together to create what the Japanese call umami—that deep, savory, almost meaty taste that makes you want to keep eating.</p>

<p>Pure MSG tastes one-dimensional. Miso tastes like a symphony.</p>

<h2>Fourteen Thousand Years of Fermentation</h2>

<p>The history of miso reaches back further than you might expect.</p>

<p>During the Jōmon period, which began around 14,000 BCE and lasted until roughly 300 BCE, the people living in what is now Japan were already fermenting grains and fish into pastes and sauces. These weren't miso as we know it, but they were ancestors—early experiments in controlled rot that preserved food and created new flavors.</p>

<p>The more direct ancestor came from China around the third century BCE. Chinese cooks had developed a fermented soybean product called shì, and when Buddhism spread to Japan in the sixth century CE, it brought this fermented food along with its scriptures and temples. The Japanese called early versions hishio, and later mishō, which eventually became miso.</p>

<p>For centuries, miso was chunky. Cooks didn't grind the soybeans; they left them somewhat whole, producing something closer to the sticky fermented soybeans called nattō that still divides opinion today. Then, during the Muromachi period in the 1400s, Buddhist monks made a discovery that would transform Japanese cooking: you could grind the soybeans into a smooth paste.</p>

<p>This opened up entirely new possibilities. A paste could be dissolved into soup. It could coat foods for grilling. It could become a glaze, a marinade, a dipping sauce. The monks had invented something versatile enough to appear at every meal.</p>

<p>By the Sengoku period—the chaotic "Age of Warring States" that lasted from the mid-1400s to the early 1600s—miso had become strategic. Warlords called daimyō oversaw miso production the way modern governments oversee ammunition factories. A well-supplied army needed protein, and in a country where Buddhism discouraged meat eating, miso provided it. The paste was portable, shelf-stable, and nutritionally dense.</p>

<p>During this same era, families began making miso at home. The word temaemiso appeared, meaning "homemade miso," and it carried a double meaning. To this day, when Japanese speakers want to describe someone bragging about their own accomplishments, they use this word. Everyone thinks their own miso is best.</p>

<h2>White, Red, and Everything Between</h2>

<p>Walk into a Japanese supermarket and you'll find a bewildering array of miso varieties. Some are pale yellow, almost white. Others are the deep reddish-brown of old leather. Some come studded with visible grain. Others are smooth as silk.</p>

<p>The basic distinction is between white miso, called shiromiso, and red miso, called akamiso. But this simple dichotomy hides enormous complexity.</p>

<p>White miso ferments for a short time, sometimes just a few weeks. It contains more rice and less soybeans, which gives it a sweeter, milder flavor. The pale color comes from using boiled soybeans rather than steamed ones, and from limiting the chemical reactions that darken the paste over time.</p>

<p>Red miso takes the opposite approach. It ferments for months, sometimes more than a year. During this extended aging, a chemical process called the Maillard reaction gradually darkens the paste. This is the same reaction that browns bread in a toaster or creates the crust on a seared steak. In miso, it produces deep, complex flavors: salty, slightly astringent, intensely savory.</p>

<p>Geography matters too. In the Kantō region surrounding Tokyo, people prefer darker, stronger miso. In the Kansai region around Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, lighter varieties dominate. Some areas have developed specialty misos with devoted followings.</p>

<p>Hatchō miso, for example, comes from Okazaki in Aichi prefecture. It uses only soybeans—no added grain at all—and ages in massive wooden barrels weighted down with river stones. The technique hasn't changed since the Sengoku period, when local warlords relied on it to feed their troops. The result is intensely dark, almost black, with a concentrated umami punch that some find overwhelming and others find addictive.</p>

<p>Then there's mugi miso, made with barley instead of rice. It has an earthier character and a distinctive aroma that some describe as rural or farmhouse-like. Kyushu and western Japan favor this variety.</p>

<p>Mixed misos, called awasemiso, blend different types to balance their characteristics. A salty soybean miso might be tempered with sweeter rice miso. A dark miso might be lightened with a pale one. These combinations let cooks fine-tune flavors for specific dishes.</p>

<h2>The Science of Flavor</h2>

<p>What makes miso taste the way it does? The answer involves chemistry that scientists are still working to fully understand.</p>

<p>Start with the proteins. Soybeans contain enormous amounts of protein, and when the kōji's enzymes break these proteins apart, they release amino acids. Glutamate is the famous one, but it's far from alone. The amino acid soup in well-aged miso creates layered savory notes that no single compound can match.</p>

<p>Then there are the sugars. The same enzymes that attack proteins also break down starches in the rice or barley into simple sugars. Some of these sugars remain, giving sweeter misos their characteristic taste. Others participate in the Maillard reaction, generating hundreds of new flavor compounds as they combine with amino acids under heat and time.</p>

<p>Among these Maillard products are furanones—ring-shaped molecules with powerful aromas. One in particular, with the unwieldy name 4-hydroxy-2-ethyl-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone, or HEMF for short, contributes much of the sweet, caramelized quality in rice miso. Scientists use HEMF content as one measure of miso quality.</p>

<p>Barley miso develops different aromatic compounds, including ferulic acid and vanillic acid. The latter, as its name suggests, has vanilla-like characteristics. These acids help explain why barley miso smells different from rice miso, even when other factors are similar.</p>

<p>The fermentation process itself adds another layer. As the miso ages, beneficial bacteria like Tetragenococcus halophilus join the fungus, contributing their own metabolic products to the mix. These microorganisms are why miso makers talk about their product as living food.</p>

<p>And that living quality matters for how you cook with miso. Heat kills microorganisms, and vigorous boiling can destroy some of the delicate flavor compounds that aging created. This is why traditional recipes call for adding miso to soup just before serving, after the pot has come off the heat. The goal is to dissolve and distribute the paste without subjecting it to prolonged cooking.</p>

<h2>Miso in the Kitchen</h2>

<p>The most common use of miso is also its most fundamental: miso soup. The Japanese call it misoshiru, and for millions of people, breakfast without it would be unthinkable.</p>

<p>Making miso soup is straightforward. You start with dashi, a stock made from kombu seaweed and dried bonito flakes. You add ingredients—perhaps cubes of tofu, sliced scallions, wakame seaweed. You bring everything just to a simmer. Then, at the last moment, you whisk in miso paste until it dissolves. Serve immediately.</p>

<p>The pairing of plain white rice with miso soup forms the foundation of traditional Japanese meals. This combination is so fundamental that the Japanese language has a word for it: ichiju-issai, meaning "one soup, one side." It's the minimum acceptable meal, the baseline from which more elaborate eating builds.</p>

<p>But miso soup barely scratches the surface of what this ingredient can do.</p>

<p>Glazed foods represent another major category. Sweet miso mixed with sugar or molasses creates a sticky coating for grilled items. At festivals throughout Japan, you'll find miso-glazed mochi—chewy rice cakes painted with the paste and charred over open flames. Dango, sweet dumplings on skewers, often get the same treatment. The combination of caramelized miso and slight char creates flavors that read as simultaneously sweet, savory, and smoky.</p>

<p>Dengaku takes this glazing tradition further. Vegetables, tofu, or fish are coated with sweetened miso and grilled or broiled until the surface bubbles and browns. The dish originated with tofu—the name dengaku references the stilts that traditional dancers wore, which the standing tofu slices supposedly resemble—but has expanded to include eggplant, daikon radish, and various proteins.</p>

<p>Marinades represent yet another application. Fish or chicken left overnight in a mixture of miso and sake or mirin emerges transformed, the proteins tenderized and infused with umami. Grilled the next day, the marinated protein develops a lacquered surface as the sugars in the miso caramelize.</p>

<p>Japanese home cooks also make okazu-miso, which translates roughly as "side-dish miso." These are thick mixtures of miso combined with vegetables, aromatics, or spices, meant to be eaten in small amounts alongside rice. A dab of okazu-miso on hot rice provides concentrated flavor that makes simple carbohydrates satisfying.</p>

<p>And then there are pickles. Misozuke, vegetables preserved in miso, develop a sweetness and depth that salt pickles lack. Cucumbers, daikon, napa cabbage, and eggplant all work well. The miso draws out moisture while infusing the vegetables with its savory character. The resulting pickles tend toward the sweeter, milder end of the Japanese pickle spectrum.</p>

<h2>Beyond Japan</h2>

<p>For most of its history, miso remained primarily Japanese. Other Asian cultures had their own fermented soybean products—Korean doenjang, Chinese doubanjiang, Indonesian tempeh—but miso itself didn't travel far.</p>

<p>That began changing in the late twentieth century, and the change accelerated after 2010. As interest in Japanese cuisine spread globally, miso followed. By 2018, international demand was growing notably, and producers had begun adapting the product for new markets.</p>

<p>Some of these adaptations involve ingredients. Traditional miso uses soybeans, but producers in various countries now make versions from chickpeas, corn, azuki beans, amaranth, and quinoa. These alternatives appeal to people avoiding soy or seeking different flavor profiles. Chickpea miso, for instance, tends toward nuttier, milder notes than its soybean original.</p>

<p>Other adaptations address health concerns. Some modern misos contain reduced salt for people managing blood pressure. Others incorporate added calcium or soup stocks, essentially creating instant miso soup bases.</p>

<p>The relationship between miso and blood pressure deserves a note here. Miso is salty—there's no getting around that. Salt can raise blood pressure in susceptible individuals, and doctors often recommend that people with hypertension limit sodium intake. Logic would suggest avoiding miso.</p>

<p>But several studies have complicated this picture. Research using salt-sensitive hypertensive models suggests that miso might not raise blood pressure as much as equivalent amounts of plain salt would. The mechanism isn't fully understood, but something in miso's complex mixture may partially counteract salt's effects on blood vessels. This doesn't mean people should ignore their doctors' advice, but it does suggest that miso's health impacts are more nuanced than simple sodium content would indicate.</p>

<p>Other health claims about miso are more dubious. Some sources claim miso is high in vitamin B12, which would make it valuable for vegetarians and vegans who struggle to get this nutrient. However, studies have contradicted these claims. The bacteria that might produce B12 during fermentation don't seem to produce it in amounts that matter nutritionally.</p>

<p>Miso does contain beneficial microorganisms, including varieties of Lactobacillus. But these living cultures only survive if the miso isn't heated too much, which brings us back to the traditional advice: add miso at the end of cooking, or skip cooking altogether.</p>

<h2>The Living Tradition</h2>

<p>Industrial production now dominates the miso market. Large factories churn out consistent product at scales that traditional producers couldn't dream of matching. In supermarkets, you'll find shelf-stable containers that can sit unopened for months.</p>

<p>But something is lost in industrialization. Traditional miso was made in wooden barrels, using local soybeans and grains, with recipes that varied from family to family and region to region. The fermentation happened at its own pace, influenced by seasonal temperature changes and the particular microbial community that had colonized each producer's equipment over generations.</p>

<p>Some producers still work this way. In Okazaki, where hatchō miso originated, makers still age their paste in hundred-year-old wooden barrels weighted with river stones. The technique requires patience—hatchō miso ferments for two summers—but adherents insist the result justifies the wait.</p>

<p>Home production has become rare, but it hasn't disappeared entirely. Making miso at home isn't technically difficult. You need soybeans, salt, and kōji—which you can now purchase online—plus time and a cool place to store your fermenting paste. The internet has enabled a small revival, connecting would-be home producers with suppliers and instructions.</p>

<p>Whether homemade miso actually tastes better than factory production is debatable. Certainly it tastes different. The microorganisms in your kitchen aren't the same as the ones in a factory. Your soybeans might be a different variety. Your fermentation temperature will fluctuate with your local weather. All of these variables produce variations in the final product.</p>

<p>And perhaps that's the point. For a thousand years, every household in Japan made temaemiso—their own miso, unique to their family, their region, their particular circumstances. Everyone thought their miso was best because it was theirs, made with their labor, for their meals.</p>

<p>The factory version might be more consistent. It might even be better by some objective measure. But it will never carry the pride of having made it yourself, or the flavor of a process that unfolded in your own home over months of patient waiting.</p>

<p>That's the thing about fermentation. You can't rush it. You can optimize it, industrialize it, standardize it. But the microorganisms set the pace, and the best you can do is create good conditions and let time do its work. In a world obsessed with speed and instant results, miso reminds us that some things simply take as long as they take.</p>

<p>Add it to your soup just before serving. The living cultures will thank you.</p>
