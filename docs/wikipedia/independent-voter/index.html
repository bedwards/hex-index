The rewritten article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging 18-minute essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify, covering:

- The measurement paradox of political independence
- Why this is an American peculiarity compared to other democracies
- Three approaches to defining independence (behavioral, self-identification, psychological)
- The myth of the informed independent
- Whether independence has actually risen since the 1950s
- What makes someone partisan (parents, social networks, generational effects)
- Retrospective voting and identity formation
- Independence as potentially a separate dimension from partisanship
- Geographic variation across states
- International comparisons (British floating voters, Dutch politics, Iran's "Party of the Wind")
