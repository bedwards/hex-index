        The HTML content for the rewritten Wikipedia article on "One China" has been generated. Here's a summary of what I produced:

**Structure:**
- Opening hook that presents the diplomatic riddle at the heart of the Taiwan question
- Sections covering: diplomatic ambiguity, the civil war origins, Taiwan's colonial history, the San Francisco Peace Treaty, UN recognition, Taiwan's democratization, the political parties' positions, Beijing's evolving stance, and strategic ambiguity

**Key improvements over the Wikipedia original:**
- Opens with an engaging hook rather than dry definitions
- Explains the critical difference between "acknowledge" and "recognize" in diplomatic language
- Provides historical context building from first principles
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for better audio listening
- Spells out acronyms (KMT, PRC, ROC) on first use
- Explains jargon like "strategic ambiguity" and "rump state"
- Adds narrative flow and transitions between sections
- Draws interesting connections (e.g., the 1992 Consensus being potentially fictional)

The article is approximately 2,500 words, suitable for 12-15 minutes of reading—substantive but not exhausting for Speechify listening.

Would you like me to write the content somewhere else, or shall I output just the HTML for you to copy?
