        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article. The content transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key changes include:

- **Opening hook**: Starts with the human impact (10,000 people deceived annually) rather than a dry definition
- **Varied rhythm**: Mix of short punchy paragraphs and longer explanatory ones
- **First principles explanations**: Explains how poverty plus awareness of opportunity creates trafficking conditions, rather than just stating "poverty causes trafficking"
- **Historical context**: Details how the sex industry emerged from military bases during the Vietnam War era
- **Clear structure**: Organized by concept (economics, geography, demographics, law) with narrative flow
- **Humanized ending**: Closes with a typical victim's experience to make abstract statistics concrete

The article is approximately 2,500 words, providing 12-15 minutes of reading time with Speechify.
