        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on nerve nets. The content transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features:

- **Hook-forward structure**: Opens with the evocative image of "a brain spread throughout your entire body"
- **Varied rhythm**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones for audio listening
- **Jargon explained**: Technical terms like cephalization, diploblasts, and voltage-gated ion channels are explained in plain language
- **First principles approach**: Builds understanding step by step, from basic concepts to evolutionary implications
- **Interesting connections**: Draws parallels to the somatosensory homunculus, discusses the mystery of independent nervous system evolution
- **Narrative flow**: Uses transitions and storytelling rather than encyclopedia-style lists
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy, paragraphs, and emphasis for Speechify compatibility

The article needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/nerve-net/index.html` once the directory is created and write permissions are granted. The content follows the same template structure as the existing Wikipedia articles in the project (like `nihilism/index.html`), linking to the shared stylesheet and using the same header/navigation structure.
