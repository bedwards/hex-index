        The article has been written. Let me provide a summary of what I created:

The rewritten article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content about Joseph Campbell into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify reading. Key improvements include:

**Narrative hook**: Opens with the striking image of an 82-year-old mythology professor marveling at a Grateful Dead concert, rather than a dry biographical statement.

**Varied structure**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory sections, creating rhythm for audio listening.

**Explained concepts**: Technical terms like "monomyth," "archetypes," and "collective unconscious" are introduced with clear explanations.

**Connections to context**: References the hero's journey concept which relates to the Substack article about Snakes & Ladders (a game about ascents and descents, virtue and vice).

**Key sections covered**:
- His remarkable five-year self-education period (nine hours of reading daily)
- The core thesis of The Hero with a Thousand Faces
- The "metaphor problem" and his radical position on theists vs atheists
- "Follow your bliss" properly explained (not the bumper sticker version)
- The Star Wars influence
- The four functions of myth
- His teaching career and intellectual influences

**Length**: Approximately 2,800 words, suitable for 15-20 minutes of reading/listening time.
