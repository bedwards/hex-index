        I've prepared the rewritten article on scientific racism. The content transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging essay suitable for text-to-speech reading. Here are the key features:

**Structure:**
- Opens with the dramatic 1950 UNESCO statement rather than a dry definition
- Flows chronologically from early classification attempts through modern persistence
- Uses varied paragraph lengths for audio rhythm
- 24 minute estimated reading time

**Key sections covered:**
- The 1950 UNESCO reckoning and what it meant
- François Bernier's 1684 first racial classification
- The monogenism vs polygenism debate (Boyle, Lord Kames)
- Linnaeus' taxonomic system and its problems  
- Charles White's "Great Chain of Being" hierarchy
- 19th century craniometry explosion
- Early critics: Franz Boas, Julian Huxley, Lancelot Hogben
- Post-WWII scientific consensus
- Modern persistence ("The Bell Curve", "Mankind Quarterly", online movements)
- Why this history matters for understanding pseudoscience

The article is ready to be written to `docs/wikipedia/scientific-racism/index.html` once you grant write permissions for that new directory.
