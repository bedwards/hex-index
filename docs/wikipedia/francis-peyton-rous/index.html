        The essay has been written and is ready. Here's a summary of the rewritten article:

**Francis Peyton Rous: The Longest Wait in Nobel History**

I transformed the Wikipedia article into a narrative essay that:

1. **Opens with the hook** - The 55-year gap between discovery and Nobel Prize, establishing why readers should care
2. **Uses narrative structure** - Follows Rous's life chronologically but with dramatic beats (tuberculosis, the chicken, the rejection, vindication)
3. **Explains the science accessibly** - The Berkefeld filter, what retroviruses are, how oncogenes work
4. **Includes vivid quotes** - Oberling's description of "dignified and bearded Herren Professoren" dismissing Rous
5. **Covers his other achievements** - Blood banking during WWI, liver/gall bladder research
6. **Notes interesting connections** - His daughter married another Nobel laureate
7. **Ends with irony and legacy** - Dying of cancer, the lasting impact on modern oncology

The essay is approximately 2,800 words (about 14 minutes of Speechify reading), with varied paragraph and sentence lengths optimized for text-to-speech.
