        I've written a comprehensive essay on glow discharges, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about familiar technologies sharing a common ancestor
- Explains the physics from first principles (what plasma is, why low pressure matters, how the Townsend avalanche works)
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for good audio rhythm
- Covers key topics: the anatomy of a glow discharge, different discharge regimes, sputtering and its dual nature as both problem and analytical tool
- Connects to the related Substack article about vacuum tubes
- Explains technical terms when introduced (bremsstrahlung, secondary electron emission, etc.)
- Adds interesting context (the quantum mechanics connection, striations as an unsolved problem)

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/glow-discharge/index.html` but I need write permission for that new directory. Would you like to grant permission so I can save the article?
