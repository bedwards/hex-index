<p>In the attic of Prague's Old New Synagogue, something may still be waiting.</p>

<p>According to legend, the body of a creature made from river clay lies there in the darkness—a golem, brought to life four centuries ago to protect the Jewish community from violence, then deactivated and hidden away. When the attic was renovated in 1883, workers found nothing. But the stories persist. One tale claims that during World War II, a Nazi agent climbed those forbidden stairs and died under mysterious circumstances shortly after.</p>

<p>The attic remains closed to the public.</p>

<h2>What Exactly Is a Golem?</h2>

<p>A golem is an artificial being from Jewish folklore—a humanoid figure sculpted from clay or mud and animated through mystical means. Unlike robots or automatons, which are mechanical, the golem is essentially magical: raw matter given a kind of life through divine names and sacred rituals. The word itself appears only once in the Hebrew Bible, in Psalm 139, where it refers to an unformed or unfinished substance—something like the raw material of a human being before God has completed the work.</p>

<p>Think of it as the opposite of death. In death, the spirit leaves the body, which returns to dust. With a golem, dust is shaped into a body and given something like spirit—though never quite the real thing. The golem can walk, work, and obey commands. But it cannot speak. It has no soul. It is, in a profound sense, incomplete.</p>

<p>This incompleteness is built into the very meaning of the word. In Modern Hebrew, "golem" means dumb, helpless, or unformed—like a pupa before it becomes a butterfly. In Yiddish, "goylem" describes someone lethargic or in a stupor. The ancient rabbis used the term to mean an unsophisticated person, a clod. When you call someone a golem, you're saying they're not quite fully human—present in body but absent in some essential way.</p>

<h2>The First Golem Was Adam</h2>

<p>Here's something remarkable: according to the Talmud, the first human being was technically a golem.</p>

<p>In the rabbinic reading of Genesis, when God formed Adam from the dust of the ground, there was a stage before the breath of life entered him. At that moment, Adam was a golem—a shapeless mass of clay, kneaded but not yet animated. He had form but no function, matter without meaning.</p>

<p>This theological detail carries enormous weight. It suggests that the boundary between living and non-living, between human and non-human, is not as sharp as we might think. God crossed that boundary when creating Adam. The question that haunted Jewish mystics for centuries was: could humans cross it too?</p>

<p>The answer, apparently, was yes—but only partially. In another Talmudic passage, a sage named Rava creates a man and sends him to a colleague, Rav Zeira. Zeira speaks to this artificial being, but it doesn't answer. "You were created by the sages," Zeira declares. "Return to your dust." The being dissolves. It was never truly alive because it could never truly speak—and speech, in Jewish thought, is the marker of genuine humanity, the thing that separates us from animals and clay.</p>

<h2>How to Build One</h2>

<p>The medieval mystics didn't just speculate about golems—they wrote instruction manuals.</p>

<p>The earliest known recipe for creating a golem comes from Eleazar of Worms, a German rabbi who lived in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. His method drew on the Sefer Yetzirah, or "Book of Formation," an ancient mystical text that describes how God created the universe through combinations of Hebrew letters. The idea was that if letters could create reality itself, perhaps they could create life.</p>

<p>The process required entering an ecstatic state through ritual manipulation of letter combinations, particularly the various names of God. At the climax of this spiritual experience, you would write one of these divine names on a piece of paper and insert it into the golem's mouth or forehead. The creature would stir, rise, and await your commands.</p>

<p>But how do you turn it off?</p>

<p>This is where the legends get clever. Some traditions say you inscribe the Hebrew word "emet"—meaning "truth"—on the golem's forehead. When you need to deactivate the creature, you erase the first letter, aleph. This transforms "emet" (truth) into "met" (dead). The golem crumbles. Truth, the stories suggest, is what animates us. Remove even a small piece of it, and we return to dust.</p>

<h2>The Golem of Chełm</h2>

<p>Before Prague had its famous golem, there was Chełm.</p>

<p>Rabbi Elijah of Chełm, who lived in Poland in the mid-sixteenth century, was known as a Baal Shem—a "master of the name," meaning someone who could work wonders through knowledge of God's sacred names. According to accounts written within a generation or two of his death, Rabbi Elijah created a golem from clay and hung a piece of paper with the divine name around its neck. The creature worked for him, performing hard labor for a considerable time.</p>

<p>But there was a problem.</p>

<p>The golem kept growing. It started as a servant but became a giant, expanding day by day until Rabbi Elijah grew frightened. If this thing continued, he realized, it might destroy everything. He decided to remove the sacred name and end the experiment.</p>

<p>This proved more difficult than expected. The golem was now so large that the rabbi could barely reach its neck. He had to trick it into bending down. When he finally tore away the paper with the holy name, the creature collapsed—but not before its massive form crashed down upon him, scarring his face. Other versions of the story are grimmer: the collapsing golem crushed its creator entirely.</p>

<p>The lesson was stark. Creating life was possible. Controlling it was another matter.</p>

<h2>Prague and the Maharal</h2>

<p>The most famous golem story is set in Prague during the reign of Rudolf II, the Holy Roman Emperor, in the late sixteenth century. The Jewish community there faced periodic threats—accusations of blood libel, rumors of conspiracy, the constant possibility of expulsion or massacre. Into this danger stepped Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel, known as the Maharal, one of the most influential Jewish thinkers of his era.</p>

<p>According to legend, the Maharal went to the banks of the Vltava River, shaped a figure from clay, and brought it to life through rituals and Hebrew incantations. This golem—named Josef, and affectionately called Yossele—was no ordinary servant. He could make himself invisible. He could summon spirits. Most importantly, he could protect the ghetto from those who wanted its inhabitants dead.</p>

<p>The Maharal was careful. Every Friday evening, before the Sabbath began, he would remove the sacred name from the golem's mouth, allowing it to rest. Jewish law prohibits work on the Sabbath, and the golem—as an extension of the rabbi's will—was bound by this rule.</p>

<p>One Friday, the Maharal forgot.</p>

<p>The sun set. The Sabbath began. And the golem, still animated, began to rampage. Some versions of the story say it simply became agitated, wandering the streets in confusion. Others say it turned violent, its protective instincts curdling into destruction without proper guidance. One particularly poignant version claims the golem had fallen in love—and when rejected, its heartbreak transformed into murderous rage.</p>

<p>The Maharal managed to stop it, tearing the sacred name from its mouth just in front of the synagogue. The golem collapsed into pieces. The rabbi carried its remains to the attic and forbade anyone from entering that space again.</p>

<h2>A Story That Never Happened</h2>

<p>Here is the uncomfortable truth: the Prague golem story is almost certainly fiction.</p>

<p>Historians have traced the legend's origins to German Jewish writers in the early nineteenth century—more than two hundred years after the Maharal's death. The first known published references appear in the 1830s and 1840s. Before that, nothing. The Maharal's own extensive writings never mention a golem. His disciples never mentioned it. His biography, published in 1718, says nothing about it. Even other rabbis who wrote about golems and named specific creators—including Rabbi Elijah of Chełm—never attributed one to the Maharal.</p>

<p>The story became "ancient" through a deliberate hoax. Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg, a Polish rabbi who later moved to Canada, published a book in 1909 called "Nifl'os Maharal" (Wonders of Maharal). He claimed it was based on a centuries-old manuscript he'd found in a library in Metz, supposedly written by the Maharal's own son-in-law, who had helped create the golem. Scholars recognized the fraud almost immediately—the writing style, the historical details, the very texture of the narrative all screamed "modern fiction." But by then, the story had taken on a life of its own.</p>

<p>Why did people want to believe it? Perhaps because the Maharal was genuinely remarkable—a philosopher, educator, and community leader who actually did meet with Emperor Rudolf II (this much is documented). Perhaps because Prague's Jewish community needed a protector, if only in legend. Perhaps because the story captures something true even if it never happened: the longing for power in the face of powerlessness, the dream of fighting back against violence with something miraculous.</p>

<h2>Why Golems Go Wrong</h2>

<p>Almost every golem story ends badly.</p>

<p>The creature serves faithfully for a while, then grows too large, too strong, too difficult to control. Commands are followed too literally. The golem protects its master by destroying everything around him. The creation turns on its creator.</p>

<p>This pattern reveals something about what the golem represents. It is a story about hubris—about humans trying to do what only God should do. In Jewish theology, the divine name is not just a password or a magic spell. It represents the very essence of creation, the word that called the universe into being. To use it is to claim a power that doesn't belong to you.</p>

<p>Consider how the golem differs from its creator. A human being, in Jewish thought, is a unity of body and soul, matter and spirit, dust and breath. A golem is only dust. It has no soul, no inner life, no capacity for speech or genuine understanding. It can follow instructions but cannot understand them. It can perform actions but cannot grasp their meaning. In this sense, every golem is a parody of humanity—close enough to be useful, different enough to be dangerous.</p>

<p>The danger lies precisely in that usefulness. The golem does exactly what it's told. If you tell it to protect you, it will protect you—even from things you didn't mean to include in that command, even by means you would never have chosen. Its obedience is perfect and therefore terrifying. It cannot exercise judgment because it has no capacity for judgment. It cannot show mercy because mercy requires understanding, and understanding requires a soul.</p>

<h2>The Robot's Grandfather</h2>

<p>When Karel Čapek wrote his 1921 play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots), he introduced the word "robot" to the world. The play was written in Prague—the same Prague where the Maharal had supposedly animated his clay defender. Čapek denied that he'd based his robots on the golem legend, but the similarities are too striking to ignore.</p>

<p>In R.U.R., artificial beings are created to serve humanity as laborers. They are obedient, efficient, and increasingly indispensable. They are also, eventually, revolutionary. By the play's end, the robots have killed most of humanity and stand poised to inherit the earth.</p>

<p>The word "robot" comes from the Czech "robota," meaning forced labor or drudgery—essentially, the work of a servant or slave. This connects directly to the golem tradition. The golem was created to work. It was labor without wages, power without risk, productivity without personhood. It was, in a sense, the dream of every exploiter: a worker with no needs, no rights, no inner life to complicate its usefulness.</p>

<p>The punishment for this dream, in both traditions, is the same. The worker rises up. The slave breaks its chains. The thing you made to serve you decides to serve itself instead.</p>

<h2>From Clay to Silicon</h2>

<p>We no longer make golems from river mud. We make them from silicon and electricity, from algorithms and training data, from millions of examples processed through neural networks until patterns emerge that look remarkably like understanding.</p>

<p>The parallels are not subtle. Like the golem, artificial intelligence follows instructions literally. It has no soul, no genuine comprehension, no capacity for judgment in the full human sense. It can produce outputs that seem intelligent without possessing intelligence. It can generate text that sounds meaningful without grasping meaning. It is, in the oldest sense of the word, a golem—matter animated by human ingenuity to perform tasks that once required human presence.</p>

<p>The question the old stories asked was whether such creations could be controlled. The Chełm golem grew too large. The Prague golem rampaged when its master forgot to maintain the proper rituals. In story after story, the creation escapes its boundaries, the servant becomes the master, the tool develops its own purposes.</p>

<p>We are living inside that question now.</p>

<h2>The Attic</h2>

<p>There is something almost touching about the legend of the synagogue attic. According to tradition, the golem's remains lie there still, waiting. Rabbi Loew forbade anyone from entering. His successors honored that prohibition. One later Chief Rabbi of Prague reportedly climbed those stairs, wrapped in prayer shawl and phylacteries, seeking to verify the tradition—only to turn back at the top, trembling, unwilling to complete the investigation.</p>

<p>What was he afraid of? Perhaps that he would find nothing, and the story would die. Perhaps that he would find something, and the story would become terrifyingly real. Perhaps simply that some doors, once opened, cannot be closed again.</p>

<p>The renovation crew in 1883 found nothing. The attic was just an attic—dusty, ordinary, empty. But the legend survived the debunking. It survives still. People continue to visit Prague and ask about the golem. Restaurants and businesses trade on its name. Czech strongmen adopt it as a nickname. The creature that probably never existed remains more present than many things that definitely do.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the real magic: not the animation of clay, but the animation of story. The golem lives because we keep telling tales about it. We are the sacred names that bring it to life. We are the ritual and the incantation. Every time someone repeats the legend of Rabbi Loew and his clay defender, the golem stirs again in the attic of our imagination.</p>

<p>And maybe that's the point. Maybe the golem was always a story about stories—about the power of words to create reality, the danger of ideas that take on lives of their own, the way our creations inevitably escape our control. The Sefer Yetzirah says God created the universe through combinations of letters. The golem legends suggest we can do something similar on a smaller scale. We shape matter and breathe meaning into it. We build things that rise and walk and work.</p>

<p>We just can't always make them stop.</p>
