<p>Before there was anything, there was a dream. In the emptiness before creation, the Lenape creator spirit Kishelamàkânk fell asleep in the void and dreamed the entire world into being—mountains, forests, animals, humans, even the ceremonies they would perform. Then he woke up. And there was nothing again.</p>

<p>So he set about making the dream real.</p>

<h2>The Original Telling</h2>

<p>The story of Turtle Island is one of the oldest continuously told narratives in North America. European colonists first recorded it between 1679 and 1680, when a Hackensack elder named Tantaqué explained it to Jasper Danckaerts near Fort James in Lower Manhattan. But the story had already been traveling through indigenous communities for countless generations before any European ears heard it.</p>

<p>According to the Lenape tradition, Kishelamàkânk began by creating helper spirits: the Grandfathers of the North, East, and West, and the Grandmother of the South. Together, they shaped the Earth as it had appeared in the dream. One of their final acts was to create a special tree. From its roots emerged the first man. When the tree bent down and kissed the ground, the first woman sprang forth.</p>

<p>Everything worked beautifully. For a while.</p>

<h2>The Bear's Tooth and the Great Flood</h2>

<p>The trouble started with a single magical object: a tooth from a giant bear that granted its owner special powers. Humans, being humans, started fighting over it. The wars grew so devastating that people scattered across the land, forming new tribes and developing new languages just to get away from each other.</p>

<p>The creator saw this chaos and sent down a spirit named Nanabush to restore harmony. Nanabush climbed to the top of a mountain and lit the first Sacred Fire. Its smoke drifted across the world, and curiosity drew all the scattered peoples to investigate. When they gathered, Nanabush crafted the first ceremonial pipe from a sumac branch and a bowl of soapstone. The creator provided tobacco. And Nanabush taught the people that whenever conflicts arose, they should sit together, smoke, and make decisions that served everyone's good.</p>

<p>This was the first peace pipe. The first parliament. The original talking circle.</p>

<p>But peace didn't last. That troublesome bear tooth found its way into a conflict between two malevolent spirits—a giant toad who controlled all the waters, and an evil snake. In their struggle, the toad swallowed both the tooth and the snake. The snake, now inside the toad, bit through its captor's side.</p>

<p>The waters exploded out.</p>

<p>Nanabush saw the flood coming and began climbing the nearest mountain, grabbing every animal he could find along the way and tucking them into his sash. When he reached the summit, there was a cedar tree. He climbed it, breaking off branches as he went higher and higher. At the very top, with water still rising, he pulled out his bow, played it like a musical instrument, and sang. The waters stopped.</p>

<h2>The Turtle Volunteers</h2>

<p>Now Nanabush had a problem. He was perched at the top of a cedar tree with a sash full of animals and nowhere to put them. He asked which creature could float in the water and support everyone else.</p>

<p>The turtle stepped forward.</p>

<p>This is the moment that gives the story—and the continent—its name. The turtle said he would float, and the others could rest on his back. It was a generous offer, but also a modest one. A single turtle, even a brave one, cannot support an entire world's worth of life.</p>

<p>Nanabush needed to make the turtle bigger. And for that, he needed earth.</p>

<p>The beaver volunteered to dive down and retrieve some of the old world's soil from the bottom. He dove deep. When he floated back up, he was dead. Nanabush revived him, but the beaver had found nothing.</p>

<p>The loon tried next. Same result. Dead, empty-handed, revived.</p>

<p>Finally, the muskrat descended. He stayed under longer than anyone thought possible. When he surfaced, he too was dead. But clutched in his tiny paws was a bit of mud—a handful of the old Earth.</p>

<p>Nanabush placed this earth on the turtle's back, then took out his bow and sang again. The turtle began to grow.</p>

<h2>Measuring the Expanding World</h2>

<p>As the land expanded, Nanabush sent scouts to find its edges. The bear ran for two days and returned, reporting he had reached the end. The deer took two weeks to find the boundary. Then Nanabush sent the wolf.</p>

<p>The wolf never came back.</p>

<p>The land had grown so vast that the wolf is still running. This is why wolves howl at night, according to Lenape tradition—they are calling their ancestor home from an endless journey.</p>

<h2>The Haudenosaunee Version</h2>

<p>The Iroquois Confederacy, known in their own language as the Haudenosaunee, tells a parallel but distinct version of this story. Their tradition holds that the Earth began as a thought—"the thought of a ruler of a great island which floats in space, a place of eternal peace."</p>

<p>In this telling, the central figure is Sky Woman. She fell from above when the world was still covered entirely by water—or rather, by what they call "the great cloud sea." The animals saw her falling and rushed to help. Various creatures dove to retrieve mud from the ocean floor. The muskrat succeeded where others failed, and this soil was placed on a turtle's back. The dirt multiplied. The turtle grew. Eventually, an entire continent rested on the patient shell.</p>

<p>In the Seneca language, this mythical turtle has a specific name: Hah-nu-nah. It's distinct from ha'no:wa:h, the word for an ordinary, everyday turtle you might find in a pond. The world-bearing turtle is something else entirely.</p>

<h2>Death as Creation</h2>

<p>Scholar Susan M. Hill has emphasized an aspect of the Haudenosaunee telling that Western audiences often miss: the deaths in this story are not tragedies. They are acts of creation.</p>

<p>When the muskrat dies retrieving soil for Sky Woman—called Mature Flower in some versions—this represents a fundamental belief about how existence works. We all eventually give our bodies back to the land. We become soil. That soil continues supporting life. Death feeds creation in an endless cycle.</p>

<p>This concept appears again when Mature Flower's daughter dies in childbirth, becoming the first person buried on the turtle's back. From her grave grew corn, strawberries, and other essential plants. Her death literally nourished the world.</p>

<p>The soil, in Haudenosaunee understanding, is not passive material. It has agency. It shapes creation.</p>

<h2>Turtle Island in Modern Consciousness</h2>

<p>The term "Turtle Island" experienced a renaissance in the 1970s. It moved from oral tradition into activist vocabulary, adopted by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people seeking to reframe how we think about North America.</p>

<p>American poet Gary Snyder, an ecologist and Buddhist practitioner, championed the term as a bridge between cultures. His 1974 poetry collection, simply titled "Turtle Island," won the Pulitzer Prize. Snyder argued that by translating this indigenous name into English—or Spanish as "Isla Tortuga"—we could shift how people understand the continent itself. It becomes not a "new world" discovered by Europeans, but an ancient place with its own deep identity.</p>

<p>The name has since proliferated through contemporary culture. The Turtle Island Quartet, a jazz string ensemble, adopted it. Turtle Island Foods, makers of Tofurky, borrowed it. Research cooperatives and educational programs use it. At Canadian universities, it's now common for courses, meetings, and graduation ceremonies to begin with spoken acknowledgments of traditional Indigenous territories, often including reference to Turtle Island.</p>

<h2>The Power of Stories</h2>

<p>Cherokee-Greek writer Thomas King opens every chapter of his book "The Truth About Stories" with a version of the Turtle Island narrative. But each time he tells it, the story changes slightly. This is not a flaw. It is the point.</p>

<p>King's version features a woman named Charm from another planet—curious to a fault, always asking questions that others consider too nosy. When she becomes pregnant, she develops an unshakeable craving for Red Fern Root, which grows only beneath the oldest tree. While digging for it, she tunnels so deep she breaks through to another world and falls all the way to a young, water-covered Earth.</p>

<p>Water birds fly up to catch her. With nowhere to set her down, they offer the turtle's back. As her delivery approaches, the animals worry the space is too small, so they dive for mud. The otter succeeds, surfacing exhausted and unconscious but clutching soil in its paws. Charm creates land from this mud, magic, and the turtle's shell. She gives birth to twins who keep the world in balance—one creating flatlands, light, and woman; the other making mountains, shadows, and man.</p>

<p>King emphasizes that this is a creation story fundamentally different from the Western tradition. In Genesis, a single all-powerful deity creates unilaterally. In Turtle Island, creation is collaborative. Animals sacrifice themselves. A turtle volunteers its body. Spirits and creatures work together. The world begins in chaos and moves toward harmony through cooperation.</p>

<h2>Braiding Knowledge</h2>

<p>Botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, uses the Sky Woman story as a framework for her book "Braiding Sweetgrass," which weaves together indigenous wisdom with scientific knowledge.</p>

<p>In Kimmerer's version, Sky Woman falls from above clutching something precious in her hands—seeds from the Tree of Life. Geese rise to cushion her landing and place her on a turtle's back. Animals gather to help, some giving their lives in the search for soil. The muskrat finally surfaces, dead but successful, a handful of earth in its grasp. Sky Woman takes this offering with profound gratitude and plants her seeds, beginning the garden that becomes Turtle Island.</p>

<p>For Kimmerer, the story teaches something essential about our role as a species. Humans are what ecologists call a "keystone species"—our actions disproportionately shape the ecosystems we inhabit. The question is whether we use that power to heal or to harm. Sky Woman arrived as a gift-bearer, a gardener, a grateful recipient of others' sacrifices. We could approach our relationship with the land the same way.</p>

<p>"We cannot even begin to move toward ecological and cultural sustainability," Kimmerer writes, "if we cannot even imagine what the path feels like."</p>

<h2>The Black Snake and Water Protection</h2>

<p>In 2020, Anishinaabe author Carole Lindstrom published "We Are Water Protectors," a children's book written in response to the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy. The pipeline appears in her story as a great black snake threatening the waters.</p>

<p>This connects to a prophecy known among many Indigenous nations: that a black snake would one day threaten to poison the waters and the people. When thousands gathered at Standing Rock in 2016 to oppose the pipeline's construction, they often invoked this prophecy. They called themselves water protectors, not protesters.</p>

<p>Lindstrom's book draws directly from Turtle Island imagery. Water is the origin of life—the element that covered the world before the turtle offered its back. The book closes with the main character returning a turtle to the water, declaring, "We are stewards of the earth. Our spirits are not to be broken."</p>

<h2>Similar Concepts Worldwide</h2>

<p>The idea of a world supported by a turtle is not unique to North American traditions. Hindu cosmology features a similar concept, with a turtle supporting elephants that in turn support the earth. Terry Pratchett's beloved Discworld series imagines a flat world carried through space on the back of a giant turtle named A'Tuin. The concept has resonated across cultures and centuries.</p>

<p>But Turtle Island is specifically rooted in this continent's geography, ecology, and Indigenous nations. Other examples of indigenous place names reclaiming colonial designations include Aotearoa for New Zealand, used by the Māori; Abya Yala, a Guna term sometimes applied to the Americas as a whole; and Aztlán, the legendary ancestral homeland of the Aztec peoples.</p>

<p>These names matter. They encode relationships with the land that colonial names often erase. To call this place Turtle Island is to invoke a story of cooperation between species, of death feeding life, of a world created through collective effort rather than unilateral command.</p>

<h2>The Story That Never Ends</h2>

<p>The wolf, according to Lenape tradition, is still running somewhere out there, trying to find the edge of Turtle Island. The land keeps growing. The wolf keeps searching. And the people keep telling the story.</p>

<p>Each teller changes it slightly. Thomas King's versions shift from chapter to chapter. Different nations emphasize different animals—muskrat, otter, water beetle. Sky Woman falls from different circumstances for different reasons. The details vary.</p>

<p>But the turtle remains. Patient, stable, bearing the weight of everything. Volunteering when no one else could do what needed to be done.</p>

<p>And every night, somewhere, a wolf howls. Calling its ancestor home from a journey that began when the world was young, wet, and waiting for someone to offer their back as foundation.</p>
