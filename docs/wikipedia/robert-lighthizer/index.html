        I've prepared a comprehensive rewrite of the Robert Lighthizer Wikipedia article. The article is ready to be saved to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/robert-lighthizer/index.html` but I need write permission for that directory/file.

The rewritten article:
- Opens with a compelling hook about Lighthizer as a "heretic" who challenged free trade orthodoxy
- Traces his career from Ashtabula, Ohio through Georgetown, Covington & Burling, the Senate Finance Committee, and Reagan's trade office
- Explains his three-decade career at Skadden representing domestic industries against foreign competition
- Details his prescient warnings about China dating back to 1997
- Covers his tenure as Trump's Trade Representative, including NAFTA renegotiation and the China trade war
- Explains his "New American System" philosophy and its historical roots
- Notes the surprising bipartisan continuity under Biden
- Includes personal details about his family and his brother's Civil War preservation work
- Runs approximately 18 minutes for text-to-speech reading

Would you like me to try writing the file again, or would you prefer I output the HTML content directly?
