        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article on sabermetrics. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the Oakland A's 20-game winning streak
- Tells the story chronologically, from Henry Chadwick's box score in 1858 through modern tracking technology
- Explains technical concepts (OBP, WAR, DIPS) in accessible language
- Includes human interest elements like Davey Johnson's brewery computer and Bill James's pork and beans factory job
- Connects to the broader "Moneyball" phenomenon referenced in the related Substack article about NFL media
- Closes with a philosophical reflection on questioning conventional wisdom

The content is optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading with varied sentence and paragraph lengths, spelled-out acronyms on first use, and no jargon without explanation.

However, I need permission to write the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/sabermetrics/index.html`. Could you grant write access to create this file?
