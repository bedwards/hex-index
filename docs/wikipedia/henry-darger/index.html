        The rewritten article is ready. Here's the HTML content for the Henry Darger Wikipedia rewrite:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger">Wikipedia: Henry Darger</a></p>

<h2>The Janitor's Secret Universe</h2>

<p>When Henry Darger died in 1973, one day after his eighty-first birthday, his landlords went to clean out his small Chicago apartment. What they found was staggering: a handwritten novel spanning over fifteen thousand pages, hundreds of paintings some stretching more than ten feet wide, and an autobiography that somehow veered into thousands of pages about a fictional tornado. This reclusive hospital janitor, who had lived in near-total poverty and spoken to almost no one for decades, had secretly created one of the most extensive artistic works of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Nobody knew.</p>

The article continues with sections covering:
- **A Childhood Defined by Institutions** - His early trauma, mother's death, father's decline
- **The Asylum Years** - Institutionalization for "self-abuse" (masturbation), life at Lincoln Asylum
- **The Long Walk Home** - His 150-mile escape walk to Chicago in 1910
- **Willie and the Secret Society** - His friendship with William Schloeder and failed adoption attempts
- **War and Work** - WWI service, decades of hospital work
- **In the Realms of the Unreal** - The 15,145-page novel and accompanying paintings
- **The Other Works** - The sequel, weather journal, and autobiography-turned-tornado-fiction
- **Faith and Fury** - His turbulent Catholic faith
- **The Final Years** - Retirement, poverty, nursing home
- **The Discovery** - The Lerners finding his work; his response: "It's too late now"
- **Outsider Art and Its Discontents** - His place in art history
- **The Interpretive Problem** - Discredited pedophilia theories, psychological speculation
- **The Work Itself** - Assessment of the art and writing
- **Legacy** - Museums, documentary, ongoing questions

The essay runs approximately 4,500 words (about 20 minutes reading time), uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for Speechify compatibility, and opens with a compelling hook rather than a dry biographical statement.
