        The essay is ready. Here's what I've written:

**Commodity Fetishism: The Magic Trick of the Marketplace**

I've transformed the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay (~2,400 words, roughly 12 minutes reading time) that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - Starts with "Pick up your phone" to immediately connect to the reader's experience and the Substack article about phone addiction

2. **Builds understanding step-by-step** - Explains fetishism from first principles without assuming Marxist vocabulary

3. **Uses varied rhythm** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs ("But markets aren't natural phenomena. They're made entirely of human decisions.") with longer explanatory ones

4. **Includes the key Marx quotes** - Preserves the Cuban gold story and core passages in blockquotes

5. **Makes modern connections** - Links nineteenth-century theory to digital economy, social media data extraction, and the 2008 financial crisis

6. **Returns to the theme** - Ends by connecting commodity fetishism directly to phone addiction, tying back to the Substack article

The HTML uses semantic markup (p, h2, blockquote) optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.
