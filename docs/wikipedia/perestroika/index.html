        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on Perestroika. Here's the HTML content:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika">Wikipedia: Perestroika</a></p>

<p>In 1986, a senior Soviet official named Alexander Yakovlev confided to a small circle of trusted colleagues about what he called a "sledgehammer" strategy. The plan was audacious: they would use Lenin's own writings to attack Stalin and Stalinism. If that worked, they would use earlier socialist thinkers to attack Lenin. And then, step by step, they would dismantle the entire revolutionary apparatus from within. "The Soviet totalitarian regime could be destroyed only through glasnost and totalitarian party discipline," Yakovlev later wrote, "while hiding behind the interests of improving socialism."</p>

<p>This was perestroika—Russian for "restructuring"—and whether it was a sincere reform effort gone wrong or a deliberate demolition project remains debated to this day. What's certain is that it changed the world.</p>

<h2>The Stagnation That Demanded Change</h2>

<p>By the early 1980s, the Soviet Union was dying by inches. The economy had calcified into what historians call the "Era of Stagnation"—a polite term for systemic rot. Growth rates that once rivaled the West had collapsed. Consumer goods were scarce. The black market thrived. Meanwhile, the gerontocracy that ran the country was literally dying off: three General Secretaries passed away in less than three years between 1982 and 1985.</p>

<p>When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in March 1985 at the relatively youthful age of 54, he represented something new. He was the first Soviet leader to have been born after the 1917 Revolution, untainted by direct involvement in Stalin's purges. More importantly, he was surrounded by a younger generation of Party functionaries who had grown deeply frustrated with the system's dysfunction.</p>

<p>Russian-British sociologist Mikhail Anipkin has called perestroika a "revolution of quadragenarians"—people in their forties who had spent their careers watching the system fail and were desperate for change. His own father, a high-ranking Party official, was among those who enthusiastically embraced Gorbachev's reforms and pushed for democracy within the Party itself.</p>

<h2>Restructuring Without a Blueprint</h2>

<p>Gorbachev first uttered the word "perestroika" in a speech on December 10, 1984, three months before he even came to power. But what exactly it meant remained fuzzy for years.</p>

<p>The initial phase, from 1985 to 1987, was modest—Gorbachev talked about "acceleration" and tweaking central planning without fundamentally changing it. Think of it as rearranging furniture in a house with structural problems.</p>

<p>The more radical phase came in 1987. At a plenary session that June, Gorbachev presented his "basic theses" for economic reform. A month later, the Supreme Soviet passed the Law on State Enterprise, which sounds technical but represented a genuine break with decades of practice. State enterprises could now, in theory, determine their own output based on actual demand rather than arbitrary quotas. They had to cover their own costs. Workers' collectives, not distant ministries, would control operations.</p>

<p>The problem was that the state still owned the means of production. Factories were told to be entrepreneurial while wearing handcuffs.</p>

<p>Even more radical was the Law on Cooperatives, passed in May 1988. For the first time since the 1920s—since Lenin himself had allowed private business during his brief New Economic Policy—Soviet citizens could legally own businesses in services, manufacturing, and foreign trade. Cooperative restaurants and shops began appearing across the country.</p>

<h2>Glasnost: The Transparency That Broke the Dam</h2>

<p>Perestroika cannot be understood apart from its partner policy: glasnost, meaning "transparency" or "openness." Where perestroika was about restructuring the economy, glasnost was about restructuring information.</p>

<p>Gorbachev's calculation was straightforward. The old guard of the Communist Party would resist any meaningful reform. Their careers, their power, their worldview all depended on the existing system. To overcome them, Gorbachev needed to go over their heads—directly to the people.</p>

<p>In January 1987, he called openly for democratization. Local soviets, previously appointed by Party branches, would now be elected by citizens from among multiple candidates. This seems like a minor procedural change, but in a one-party state, it was revolutionary.</p>

<p>The March 1989 election for the Congress of People's Deputies marked the first time Soviet voters had ever chosen the membership of a national legislative body. The results stunned everyone, including Gorbachev. Across the country, voters crossed out unopposed Communist candidates—many of them prominent officials—using their newly discovered power to reject the establishment.</p>

<h2>The China Comparison</h2>

<p>At almost the same time Gorbachev was launching perestroika, another Communist giant was undergoing its own transformation. Deng Xiaoping's "reform and opening up" in China shared the same basic goal: making socialism work better through market mechanisms. The outcomes could not have been more different.</p>

<p>China's gross domestic product has grown consistently since the late 1980s. The Soviet Union's collapsed, and many successor states experienced economic free-fall throughout the 1990s—a period Russians grimly call the "wild nineties."</p>

<p>What explains the difference?</p>

<p>Deng's reforms were bottom-up, starting with agriculture and light industry. Peasants were allowed to sell produce from private plots at market prices. Special Economic Zones attracted foreign investment. State factory managers got more autonomy while the banking system was reformed to provide them capital. Crucially, prices were gradually phased out of state control through a "dual pricing" system rather than abruptly freed.</p>

<p>Gorbachev's reforms were top-down and industrial. Factory managers were told to meet state demands but find their own funding—an impossible contradiction. Price controls remained. The ruble couldn't be freely exchanged. Private property was still largely forbidden. The reforms created new bottlenecks without fixing old ones.</p>

<p>But the deepest difference was political. Deng maintained authoritarian control, suppressing political dissent—most notoriously at Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Gorbachev paired economic reform with political liberalization.</p>

<p>Gorbachev himself understood this divergence but insisted it was unavoidable. He quoted a 1986 newspaper article that he felt captured his predicament: "The apparatus broke Khrushchev's neck and the same thing will happen now." Nikita Khrushchev, the previous Soviet reformer, had been ousted in 1964 by Party hardliners. Without glasnost to mobilize public support, Gorbachev believed any economic reform would be strangled in its crib.</p>

<h2>The Parade of Sovereignties</h2>

<p>There was another factor that China didn't face: the Soviet Union was simultaneously a unitary state and a collection of nominally sovereign republics, each with its own ethnic identity. The Baltic states—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—had been independent nations within living memory, forcibly annexed in 1940. Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, and others had distinct languages, cultures, and historical grievances.</p>

<p>Glasnost didn't create these tensions, but it removed their suppression. Nationalist movements that had been forced underground for decades suddenly could organize openly. Gorbachev's extension of regional autonomy—intended to make the system more flexible—instead gave nationalists the tools to demand independence.</p>

<p>Gorbachev called this process a "parade of sovereignties," and he identified it as the single factor that most undermined his gradualist approach. He had wanted to restructure the Soviet system. Instead, he had lit the fuse that would blow it apart.</p>

<h2>The Cold War Ends</h2>

<p>On the international stage, Gorbachev promoted what he called "new political thinking"—and here, at least, the results matched his intentions. He argued for the de-ideologization of international politics, abandoning the concept of class struggle as a guide to foreign policy. Universal human interests, he said, should take priority over the interests of any class. The world was increasingly interdependent, and security should be achieved through political rather than military means.</p>

<p>This represented a fundamental break from decades of Soviet foreign policy, which had been premised on inevitable conflict between capitalism and communism. By abandoning that premise, Gorbachev removed the ideological foundation of the Cold War.</p>

<p>The implications rippled outward. When Eastern European countries began pushing for independence in 1989—Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia—the Soviet Union did not intervene with tanks as it had in Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968. The Berlin Wall fell in November 1989. Within two years, the entire Eastern Bloc had dissolved and Germany had reunified.</p>

<h2>The West Watches and Waits</h2>

<p>One of the more melancholy aspects of perestroika's failure was the response—or non-response—of Western powers. American President George H. W. Bush pledged solidarity with Gorbachev rhetorically but never committed his administration to supporting the reforms financially.</p>

<p>"No bailout for Gorbachev" was a consistent policy line of the Bush administration. Multiple factors drove this: minimalist foreign policy instincts, budget constraints, skepticism from Soviet experts about the reforms' viability, and a frugal attitude that viewed large-scale economic aid as wasteful.</p>

<p>Whether Western financial support could have saved perestroika remains counterfactual history. But the lack of it meant Gorbachev was trying to restructure a continent-spanning economy while running out of money.</p>

<h2>The Collapse</h2>

<p>By the late 1980s, perestroika had created the worst of all possible worlds: enough reform to destabilize the old system, not enough to create a functioning new one. Shortages worsened. Deficits mounted. Gorbachev's credibility eroded as people saw little tangible improvement in their lives.</p>

<p>Scholars argue that Gorbachev and his advisors underestimated both the severity of the crisis and the political risks of decentralization. They had no clear strategy for what would happen if constituent republics—now empowered by democratization—decided they wanted out entirely.</p>

<p>By the time of the Twenty-Eighth Party Congress in July 1990, the sweeping and unintended consequences of Gorbachev's reforms were undeniable. Nationalities across the constituent republics were pulling harder than ever to break away. In August 1991, hardliners attempted a coup to reverse the reforms. The coup failed, but it fatally weakened both Gorbachev and the central Soviet government.</p>

<p>By December 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved. Gorbachev resigned on Christmas Day.</p>

<h2>The Sledgehammer's Work</h2>

<p>Was perestroika a sincere reform effort that failed due to circumstances beyond Gorbachev's control? Or was it, as Yakovlev's frank confession suggests, a deliberate strategy to dismantle the Soviet system from within while appearing to improve it?</p>

<p>The answer may be both. Different actors within the reform movement had different intentions. Gorbachev himself seems to have genuinely believed in the possibility of reformed socialism—a more humane, more efficient version of the system he'd grown up in. Others around him, like Yakovlev, may have understood earlier that the system couldn't be reformed, only destroyed.</p>

<p>What's certain is that perestroika proved Yakovlev's tactical insight correct: the mechanisms of totalitarianism could be turned against the system of totalitarianism. By allowing open criticism, by permitting elections, by loosening central control, the reformers created space for forces that ultimately swept away not just the excesses of the system but the system itself.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union lasted 74 years. Perestroika lasted six. In that brief window, a superpower that had shaped the twentieth century simply ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Historians will debate for centuries whether this was tragedy or liberation, whether a better path existed, whether the dissolution was inevitable or contingent on specific choices made by specific individuals. What remains is the sheer scale of the transformation: hundreds of millions of people woke up in new countries, under new systems, facing new uncertainties.</p>

<p>For better or worse, that was perestroika's legacy—not the restructuring Gorbachev had promised, but a demolition that cleared the ground for whatever would come next.</p>

The article is approximately 2,200 words and should take about 11-12 minutes to read aloud. I've opened with the dramatic Yakovlev "sledgehammer" quote as a hook, varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio flow, spelled out acronyms on first use, explained concepts from first principles (like glasnost and the dual-pricing system), and drawn comparisons to make the material accessible. The China comparison section ties directly to the context of the related Substack article about viewing the world from China.
