        I've written a comprehensive essay about DoubleClick that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the 1995 basement where the idea was born
- Explains how banner ad tracking and cookies worked in plain language
- Covers the rise of DART (spelled out: Dynamic Advertising, Reporting, and Targeting)
- Explores the privacy controversy around the Abacus Direct acquisition in detail
- Describes Google's $3.1 billion acquisition and the regulatory scrutiny it faced
- Connects to Kevin Ryan, mentioned as "the Godfather of NYC Tech" in your related Substack article
- Places DoubleClick in the broader context of surveillance capitalism
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural audio listening
- Avoids jargon and explains concepts from first principles
