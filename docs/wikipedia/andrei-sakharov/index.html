        I've written an engaging essay about Andrei Sakharov based on the Wikipedia article. The content is complete and ready - I just need permission to save it to the file. 

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about his moral journey from weapons creator to dissident
- Explains complex physics concepts (tokamaks, radiation implosion, baryon asymmetry) in accessible language
- Weaves his personal story with broader historical context about the Cold War and Soviet society
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for good Speechify listening
- Spells out acronyms and avoids jargon
- Draws interesting connections (the Oppenheimer/Teller parallel, the ITER fusion project today)
- Runs approximately 3,500 words (~17 minutes reading time)
