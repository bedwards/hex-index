        I've written the rewritten Hot Hand Wikipedia article. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative suitable for text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the thirty-year scientific reversal
- Tells the story chronologically from the 1985 study through the 2015 correction
- Explains the gambler's fallacy as a contrasting concept
- Details the Miller-Sanjurjo statistical bug discovery in accessible terms
- Explores applications beyond basketball (investing, decision-making)
- Includes the curious age-related findings
- Closes with broader lessons about science and folk wisdom

The content is approximately 2,700 words (about 18 minutes of reading time) and uses semantic HTML with proper headings, paragraphs, and the source attribution. I need file write permission to save it.
