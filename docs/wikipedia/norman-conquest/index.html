        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Norman Conquest. Here's the content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England">Wikipedia: Norman Conquest</a></p>

<p>In the span of a single year, England had three kings, fought three major battles, and saw its entire ruling class swept away. The year 1066 remains the most famous date in English history, and for good reason: it was the last time a foreign army successfully invaded and conquered England. The ripples from that conquest shaped the English language, English law, English architecture, and the very idea of what it means to be English.</p>

<p>But the Norman Conquest wasn't just about one battle on a Sussex hillside. It was the culmination of a century of tangled alliances, broken promises, and competing claims to power. To understand how a French-speaking duke came to rule Anglo-Saxon England, we need to start with Vikings.</p>

<h2>From Raiders to Rulers: The Origins of Normandy</h2>

<p>In 911, the king of France made a desperate bargain. Charles the Simple—a name that meant "straightforward" rather than "stupid," though history has not always been kind to Charles—faced a problem he couldn't solve with armies. Viking raiders had been terrorizing the French coast for generations, sailing up rivers to plunder monasteries and towns before disappearing back to sea.</p>

<p>Charles's solution was elegant in its cynicism: he would pay one group of Vikings to keep the other Vikings out.</p>

<p>He granted a large territory along the northern French coast to a Viking chieftain named Rollo, on the condition that Rollo convert to Christianity and defend the land against further raids. The arrangement worked surprisingly well. Within a few generations, Rollo's descendants had stopped being Vikings entirely. They intermarried with the local French population, adopted Christianity with genuine enthusiasm, and began speaking a dialect of French with just enough Old Norse vocabulary thrown in to mark them as distinct.</p>

<p>They called themselves Normans—"Northmen"—and their territory became Normandy. But they retained something of their Viking ancestors' ambition and capacity for violence. Over the next century, the Normans expanded their duchy westward, annexing neighboring territories piece by piece. They also developed a fearsome reputation as warriors, particularly their cavalry, which combined heavy armor with aggressive tactics in a way that made Norman knights the most formidable fighters in Western Europe.</p>

<h2>A Marriage That Would Change History</h2>

<p>In 1002, an English king made a decision that would have consequences no one could foresee for more than half a century.</p>

<p>Æthelred the Unready—another unfortunate nickname, though this one was a pun on his name that meant "poorly advised"—married Emma of Normandy, the sister of the Norman duke. It was a diplomatic marriage, meant to strengthen ties between England and Normandy at a time when both faced threats from Danish raiders.</p>

<p>Æthelred and Emma had a son named Edward. When Danish invaders conquered England in 1013, young Edward fled to Normandy with his mother. He would spend the next twenty-five years there, growing up in the Norman court, speaking Norman French, surrounded by Norman customs and Norman friends.</p>

<p>When Edward finally returned to England in 1042 to claim the throne after the Danish dynasty died out, he was English in name only. He brought Norman advisors with him, appointed Normans to positions in the Church and the government, and surrounded himself with the culture he'd known since childhood. The English called him Edward the Confessor for his conspicuous piety, but many of them resented the foreign influence he represented.</p>

<p>One family resented it most of all: the Godwins.</p>

<h2>The Godwins: England's Most Powerful Family</h2>

<p>Godwin, Earl of Wessex, was the most powerful nobleman in England. His earldom covered most of southern England, and his sons controlled much of the rest. When Edward married Godwin's daughter Edith, it seemed to cement the family's position at the heart of English power.</p>

<p>But the relationship between Edward and the Godwins was always tense. Edward never forgave Godwin for his role in the death of Edward's brother Alfred, who had been blinded and killed after Godwin handed him over to political rivals years earlier. The Godwins, for their part, saw Edward's Norman friends as competitors for influence and wealth.</p>

<p>The struggle between king and earl erupted into open conflict in 1051, when Edward briefly exiled the entire Godwin family. During this period of estrangement, Edward may have made a fateful promise. According to Norman sources, Edward told his cousin William, Duke of Normandy, that William would inherit the English throne after Edward's death.</p>

<p>Did this actually happen? We have only Norman sources for the claim, and they had obvious reasons to invent or exaggerate such a promise. But it's not implausible. Edward had no children, he was surrounded by Normans, and he genuinely disliked the Godwins. Promising the throne to William would have been a way to spite his rivals from beyond the grave.</p>

<p>The Godwins returned from exile within a year, more powerful than ever. Godwin himself died in 1053—according to legend, he choked to death while denying any role in Alfred's murder—but his son Harold became the new Earl of Wessex and the most powerful man in England after the king.</p>

<h2>Harold's Fateful Journey</h2>

<p>Sometime around 1064 or 1065, Harold Godwinson took a ship across the English Channel. What happened next would become one of history's great disputed stories.</p>

<p>Harold's ship was blown off course and landed in the territory of a French count hostile to Normandy. William of Normandy demanded Harold's release and brought the English earl to his court. There, according to Norman accounts, Harold swore a solemn oath to support William's claim to the English throne.</p>

<p>The Bayeux Tapestry—that extraordinary 230-foot embroidered narrative of the conquest, probably made within a decade or two of the events it depicts—shows Harold placing his hands on sacred relics while William watches. In medieval Europe, an oath sworn on relics was the most binding promise a man could make. To break such an oath was not merely dishonorable but sacrilegious.</p>

<p>English sources tell a different story. They claim Harold was tricked into swearing the oath, that he didn't know relics were hidden beneath the cloth-covered table where he placed his hands. Or they claim the oath was coerced, extracted under duress while Harold was effectively a prisoner. Or they simply don't mention the oath at all.</p>

<p>What we know for certain is that Harold returned to England, and that when Edward the Confessor died on January 5, 1066, Harold did not support William's claim. Instead, he had himself crowned king the very next day.</p>

<h2>The Witenagemot Decides</h2>

<p>Harold's coronation wasn't the brazen power grab his enemies claimed. It was ratified by the Witenagemot, the council of important men—nobles, bishops, and royal officials—who traditionally advised English kings and confirmed their successions.</p>

<p>The Witenagemot had several candidates to choose from. There was Edgar Ætheling, the grandson of an earlier English king and the closest blood relative to the royal line. But Edgar was only about fourteen years old, untested in war or politics, at a time when England clearly needed a strong ruler. There was Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, who claimed the English throne based on an old agreement between Norwegian and English kings. But Hardrada was a foreigner who would rule England as a Norwegian possession.</p>

<p>And there was Harold Godwinson: an adult, a proven warrior and administrator, an Englishman who commanded the loyalty of the most powerful family in the realm. The Witenagemot chose Harold.</p>

<p>William of Normandy had a different view. To him, Harold was an oath-breaker and a usurper. The throne had been promised to William by Edward himself, and Harold had sworn to uphold that promise. William began gathering an army.</p>

<h2>A Kingdom Under Siege</h2>

<p>Harold knew invasion was coming. He spent the spring and summer of 1066 preparing, keeping his army mobilized along the southern coast where William's ships would have to land. But medieval armies couldn't stay in the field indefinitely. Most of Harold's troops were members of the fyrd, a militia system that required free men to serve for a limited period each year. These men were also farmers, and their crops wouldn't harvest themselves.</p>

<p>On September 8, with his supplies exhausted and his men needed at home, Harold disbanded his southern army. It was exactly the wrong moment.</p>

<p>Within days, word arrived from the north: Harald Hardrada had landed in Yorkshire with an enormous fleet—perhaps 300 ships carrying 15,000 warriors. Worse, Hardrada had been joined by Harold's own brother Tostig, who had been exiled from England the previous year and was now seeking revenge.</p>

<p>The Norwegian and English rebels won a crushing victory at Fulford on September 20, destroying the northern English army under Earls Edwin and Morcar. York, the second city of England, prepared to surrender.</p>

<p>Harold force-marched his army north at a pace that still astonishes military historians. His men covered nearly 200 miles in about nine days, averaging 25 miles per day over roads that were little more than dirt tracks. On September 25, the English fell on the Norwegian camp at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The battle was a slaughter. Harald Hardrada died early in the fighting, struck in the throat by an arrow. Tostig died too, along with most of the Norwegian army. Of the 300 ships that had brought the invasion force, only 24 were needed to carry the survivors home.</p>

<p>Harold had won a tremendous victory. He had also exhausted his army and positioned them 250 miles from where they were about to be needed.</p>

<h2>The Normans Land</h2>

<p>Three days after Stamford Bridge, William's fleet finally crossed the Channel. The duke had been waiting for weeks, held in port by unfavorable winds. Some of his men had begun to desert, fearing the crossing itself or losing confidence in the enterprise. When the wind finally shifted on September 27, William seized his chance.</p>

<p>His force probably numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 men—the contemporary sources give wildly varying figures, and modern historians can only estimate. About a quarter to a third of them were cavalry, another third were archers, and the remainder were infantry. They landed at Pevensey on the Sussex coast on September 28 and immediately began constructing fortifications.</p>

<p>William had chosen his landing site carefully. The area around Pevensey and nearby Hastings belonged to the Godwin family. By raiding and burning there, William wasn't just gathering supplies—he was attacking Harold personally, destroying his property and his tenants. William was also sending a message: come face me, or watch your homeland burn.</p>

<p>Harold learned of the landing while still in the north, probably around October 1 or 2. Once again, he marched at extraordinary speed, reaching London in about a week and pausing there only briefly to gather additional forces. By October 13, he was in Sussex, perhaps 6 miles from William's position at Hastings.</p>

<h2>The Hill at Senlac</h2>

<p>Harold chose his ground carefully. He positioned his army on Senlac Hill—the modern town of Battle marks the spot—blocking the road from Hastings to London. It was a strong defensive position. The hill's slopes would slow any cavalry charge, and the English fought on foot in a dense formation called the shield wall, locking their shields together to present an almost impenetrable barrier.</p>

<p>Harold's army probably numbered between 7,000 and 8,000 men, roughly equal to William's force. But there were crucial differences. Harold had few archers, while William had many. More importantly, Harold had no cavalry at all, while perhaps 2,000 of William's men fought on horseback.</p>

<p>In early medieval warfare, cavalry had a mixed record against disciplined infantry. Horses will not charge into a solid wall of spears and shields; they'll shy away or try to go around. But cavalry had tremendous advantages in pursuit and in exploiting any gap in enemy lines. If the shield wall broke, even for a moment, mounted knights could pour through and attack the vulnerable infantry from behind.</p>

<p>Everything depended on the English holding their formation.</p>

<h2>October 14, 1066</h2>

<p>The battle began around nine in the morning and lasted until dusk—an extraordinarily long engagement for the medieval period. William attacked first, sending his archers forward to rain arrows on the English line. But arrows are most effective against unarmored troops, and the English shield wall simply absorbed the volleys.</p>

<p>The Norman infantry charged uphill into the shield wall and were thrown back. The cavalry charged and were thrown back. On the left side of the Norman line, the Breton contingent broke and fled down the hill, with English troops pursuing them.</p>

<p>This was the crisis point. A rumor swept through the Norman army that William himself had been killed. If the rumor had been true, the invasion would have ended right there. But William was very much alive. He tore off his helmet so his men could see his face, rallied the panicking troops, and sent his cavalry to cut off and slaughter the English who had broken ranks to pursue the fleeing Bretons.</p>

<p>The battle resumed. The Normans attacked, were repulsed, attacked again. Twice more, Norman cavalry feigned retreat, and twice more, English soldiers broke formation to chase them, only to be ridden down when the cavalry turned.</p>

<p>Still the English center held. Harold's housecarls—his personal troops, professional warriors equipped with the best armor and the terrifying two-handed Danish axes that could split a horse's skull—stood firm on Senlac Hill as the autumn afternoon wore on.</p>

<h2>The Death of a King</h2>

<p>How Harold died remains uncertain, even a thousand years later.</p>

<p>The Bayeux Tapestry appears to show a figure being struck in the eye by an arrow, with a Latin caption identifying him as Harold. But art historians have noted that the tapestry has been repaired many times, and the "arrow in the eye" may be a later addition conforming to legends that developed in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>The earliest written account, by William of Jumièges, says simply that William killed Harold—possibly meaning that William's army killed him, or possibly that the duke struck the fatal blow himself. Another chronicler says the fighting was so intense around the king that no one actually saw how he died.</p>

<p>What we know is that Harold fell, probably late in the afternoon. With him died his brothers Gyrth and Leofwine and most of his housecarls. The English army, exhausted and leaderless, finally broke. The Normans pursued them into the gathering darkness, cutting down the fleeing survivors.</p>

<p>Harold's body was so mangled that it could only be identified by marks on his skin—possibly tattoos, possibly scars. His mother Gytha offered William her son's weight in gold for custody of the body. William refused. According to most accounts, he had Harold buried on the seashore, though Waltham Abbey later claimed to possess the king's remains.</p>

<h2>The Conquest Continues</h2>

<p>William expected the English to surrender after Hastings. They did not.</p>

<p>The Witenagemot met and proclaimed Edgar Ætheling—the teenage prince who had been passed over for Harold—as the new king. Earls Edwin and Morcar, who had missed Hastings because their forces had been wrecked at Fulford, declared their support. So did the archbishops of Canterbury and York.</p>

<p>William responded with systematic brutality. He marched around London rather than attacking it directly, burning and pillaging as he went, cutting the city off from resupply. One by one, the English leaders came to submit. Edgar Ætheling surrendered. The earls surrendered. The archbishops surrendered. London surrendered.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day 1066, William was crowned King of England in Westminster Abbey. But he would spend the next six years fighting rebellions across the kingdom.</p>

<h2>The Harrying of the North</h2>

<p>The most devastating of these rebellions came in 1069, when the north of England rose against Norman rule with Danish support. William's response was one of the most notorious acts of medieval warfare.</p>

<p>He systematically devastated the north of England. His troops killed livestock, burned crops and agricultural equipment, salted fields, and slaughtered anyone who resisted. The goal was not merely to defeat the rebellion but to ensure that no rebellion could be supported in the north for years to come.</p>

<p>The Domesday Book, compiled in 1086, records the results: village after village in Yorkshire listed as "waste," meaning uninhabited and unproductive. Contemporary chronicles report that refugees from the devastation sold themselves into slavery to survive, and that the roads were lined with corpses. Modern estimates suggest that 100,000 people may have died, from violence or from the resulting famine.</p>

<p>Even some Norman chroniclers were horrified. Orderic Vitalis, a monk of mixed Norman and English parentage writing a generation later, called the harrying of the north William's worst act and suggested it would weigh heavily on his soul at the Last Judgment.</p>

<h2>The New Order</h2>

<p>By 1072, William had crushed the last significant resistance. He then set about transforming England.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was almost entirely dispossessed. By the time of the Domesday Book, only two major landholders in England were English. Everyone else—everyone who held land directly from the king, everyone who commanded troops, everyone who held a castle—was Norman or French or Breton. It was a complete replacement of the ruling class.</p>

<p>William distributed the confiscated lands to his followers, but on different terms than Anglo-Saxon kings had used. Under the new Norman system, all land belonged ultimately to the king. Great lords held their estates in exchange for military service, and they in turn granted portions to their own followers on similar terms. This was the feudal system, and while elements of it had existed in England before, William systematized and extended it.</p>

<p>He also built castles—hundreds of them, all across England. The Anglo-Saxons had fortified towns and royal residences, but they didn't build castles in the Norman style: private fortifications that allowed a small garrison to dominate the surrounding countryside. Within a generation, England was dotted with these stone and timber strongholds, each one a visible symbol of Norman power.</p>

<h2>The Language of Power</h2>

<p>The conquest transformed the English language itself.</p>

<p>For the next three centuries, the ruling class of England spoke Norman French. Government documents were written in Latin or French. Literature patronized by the nobility was in French. English survived as the language of peasants and servants, of common people in markets and fields.</p>

<p>When the two languages finally merged in the fourteenth century—after the Black Death killed so many people that the old social barriers began to break down—the result was Middle English, the language of Chaucer. It retained English grammar and basic vocabulary but absorbed thousands of French words.</p>

<p>This is why modern English often has two words for the same thing: one Germanic, one French. A farmer raises a cow or pig or sheep (English words); a lord eats beef or pork or mutton (French words). A common man goes to court; a noble man goes to tribunal. This linguistic doubling runs throughout the language, a permanent reminder of the conquest.</p>

<h2>The Domesday Book</h2>

<p>In 1085, William ordered the most comprehensive survey of land and resources that any medieval European kingdom had ever attempted. Royal commissioners visited every shire in England, recording who held each piece of land, what it was worth, how many people lived on it, how many plows it had, how much woodland and meadow and pasture.</p>

<p>The English called it the Domesday Book—the Book of Judgment—because there was no appeal from its findings, just as there would be no appeal from the Last Judgment. It was a remarkable feat of medieval administration, and it gave William an unprecedented understanding of his kingdom's resources.</p>

<p>It also preserved a snapshot of England at a moment of tremendous change. Historians can trace the dispossession of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy village by village, comparing who held the land "in the time of King Edward" with who held it in 1086. The Domesday Book is a record of conquest.</p>

<h2>William's Death and Legacy</h2>

<p>William died in 1087, from injuries sustained when his horse stumbled and threw him against the pommel of his saddle. He was in France at the time, fighting yet another war. His body was taken to Caen for burial, but the funeral was interrupted when a local man claimed that the church had been built on land stolen from his family. The claim had to be settled before the burial could proceed.</p>

<p>Worse followed. When attendants tried to force William's corpulent body into the stone sarcophagus, it burst, filling the church with such a stench that mourners fled. It was not, perhaps, the dignified end that the conqueror of England had imagined for himself.</p>

<p>But the conquest endured. William's sons ruled England after him—first William Rufus, then Henry I. When Henry's daughter Matilda fought a civil war against her cousin Stephen, both sides were Norman. When Henry II founded the Plantagenet dynasty, he was Norman on his mother's side. The royal families of England would be of French origin for centuries to come.</p>

<h2>What the Conquest Changed</h2>

<p>Some historians have argued that the Norman Conquest changed less than it might appear. The basic structures of English government—the shires, the courts, the tax system—survived the conquest and were used by the Normans. The legal traditions that would eventually become English common law drew on both Norman and Anglo-Saxon sources. The English church maintained continuity across the conquest, though its highest offices went to Norman appointees.</p>

<p>But other things changed profoundly. The Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was destroyed so completely that by 1086 it had effectively ceased to exist. The relationship between lords and peasants was transformed by the systematization of feudal obligations. The built environment changed, as Norman castles and churches reshaped the English landscape.</p>

<p>And the culture changed. England had been connected primarily to Scandinavia; after 1066, it was connected to France. English kings held territories in France and fought French wars. English nobles married French spouses and spoke French languages. English culture absorbed French influences in everything from architecture to cuisine to literature.</p>

<h2>The End of an Era</h2>

<p>The Norman Conquest marks the end of Anglo-Saxon England as clearly as any historical event can mark an ending. The men who ruled England before October 14, 1066, were almost entirely gone by October 15. The language, the laws, the customs, the very names people gave their children—all would change in the generations that followed.</p>

<p>Harold Godwinson was the last Anglo-Saxon king. He was also, though no one knew it at the time, the last king of any origin to see England successfully invaded. Nine and a half centuries later, that record still stands.</p>

<p>The small hill at Senlac, where Harold's housecarls formed their shield wall on an autumn morning, is quiet now. A ruined abbey marks the spot where the high altar supposedly stood on the place where Harold fell. Tourists visit. School groups learn about 1066. The battle that shaped English history becomes another story from the distant past.</p>

<p>But listen carefully to English as it's spoken today, and you can still hear the conquest in every sentence—in every word borrowed from French, in every doubling of vocabulary, in the very bones of the language. Some victories echo forever.</p>
