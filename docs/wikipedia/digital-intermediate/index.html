        I've written the complete rewritten Wikipedia article about Digital Intermediate. The essay opens with the compelling story of how the Coen Brothers used this technology to transform *O Brother, Where Art Thou?*, then systematically explains:

- How traditional film processing works (original camera negatives, intermediates, photochemical timing)
- The three phases of digital intermediate: scanning, grading, and recording
- The critical role of 3D look-up tables in making the process practical
- The evolution from visual effects-only to full-film processing
- The distinction between telecine and digital intermediate
- How terminology has evolved as digital cinematography has replaced film
- The curious "film intermediate" process used on films like *Dune* and *The Batman*
- The archival paradox of recording digital masters back to film for preservation
- Key milestones from 1990 to 2005

The piece is structured for Speechify listening with varied paragraph and sentence lengths, avoids jargon (or explains it immediately), and connects back to the source Substack article about *Toy Story* through its focus on the intersection of film and digital technology.
