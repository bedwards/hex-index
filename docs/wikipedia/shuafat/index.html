<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuafat">Wikipedia: Shuafat</a></p>

<p>In 2008, archaeologists digging near a refugee camp to prepare for a light rail system stumbled onto something remarkable: the remains of a sophisticated Jewish settlement, impeccably planned with orderly rows of houses and two elegant public bathhouses. The settlement had been suddenly abandoned around 130 CE, just before the catastrophic Bar Kokhba revolt against Rome. The wealthy families who lived there—possibly including priests—had stayed close to Jerusalem after the Romans destroyed it in 70 CE, apparently hoping the Temple would someday be rebuilt.</p>

<p>They were wrong. Within a few years, Rome would crush Jewish resistance so thoroughly that Jews would be banned from Jerusalem entirely. The settlement was forgotten, buried under nearly two millennia of subsequent history.</p>

<p>Today, this same patch of earth is called Shuafat, a Palestinian Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem with 35,000 residents. It sits three miles north of the Old City, straddling one of the most contested boundaries on the planet. The light rail that prompted the archaeological dig now carries passengers through a landscape where every layer of ground tells a different story about who belongs here.</p>

<h2>Seven Thousand Years of Interrupted Habitation</h2>

<p>The oldest traces of human settlement at Shuafat date back seven thousand years, to the Chalcolithic period—that transitional era when humans first began working with copper while still relying heavily on stone tools. But Shuafat's history is not one of continuous occupation. People have come and gone, built and abandoned, conquered and fled, over and over again.</p>

<p>By the second and first centuries BCE, the site held a fortified agricultural settlement. Archaeologists in 1991 found what they initially believed might be one of the oldest synagogues ever discovered—an underground room dating to the early first century BCE. This interpretation generated considerable excitement, then considerable doubt. By 2008, the scholarly consensus had shifted: the structure probably was not a synagogue at all. Whatever it was, it was destroyed by a massive earthquake in 31 BCE, the same seismic catastrophe that damaged Herod the Great's palace at Jericho.</p>

<p>The settlement reached its peak during the Roman period, between 70 and 130 CE—precisely that window after Jerusalem's destruction when displaced Jewish elites clung to the area. The archaeological evidence for their Jewishness is compelling. Excavators found large quantities of chalkstone vessels, a distinctive type of container used only by Jews because they believed stone, unlike clay, could not transmit ritual impurity. Some of these vessels belonged to types that only appeared after 70 CE, dating the settlement precisely to the post-Temple period.</p>

<p>Later excavations also uncovered several mikva'ot—Jewish ritual baths—providing even more conclusive evidence. But the site also yielded puzzles. The public bathhouses were Roman-style, not Jewish. Archaeologists found imported Italian and Greek wines, produced by non-Jews, which observant Jews of that era would have considered impure and avoided. Were Jews operating bathhouses for Roman soldiers? Was this a mixed community? The wealth of the inhabitants is not in doubt—rich coin hoards, cosmetics, fine buildings—but their exact relationship with their Roman overlords remains unclear.</p>

<p>After the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Romans expelled Jews from Jerusalem and its surroundings. Shuafat was abandoned or destroyed, then reoccupied on a much smaller scale in the second through fourth centuries CE. Agricultural terraces from this later period have been found west of modern Shuafat Street.</p>

<h2>What's in a Name?</h2>

<p>The name Shuafat itself is a minor mystery. In the nineteenth century, the British surveyors Claude Conder and Horatio Kitchener suggested it derived from Jehoshaphat, a king of Judah who ruled in the ninth century BCE. The Arabic name does sound similar: Shu'afat echoes Yehoshaphat. Local peasants told the scholar Edward Henry Palmer that the village had been named after "a king Shafat (perhaps Jehoshaphat)."</p>

<p>But the French archaeologist Charles Clermont-Ganneau, who investigated the question more thoroughly, was skeptical. He noted that the Hebrew name Jehoshaphat lacks the guttural 'ayin sound present in Shu'afat, making the connection linguistically dubious. He recorded several competing local traditions: one woman told him the ancient name had been Alaikou; another tradition held it was once called Deir Mahruk, meaning "the burned convent." The Jehoshaphat story, Clermont-Ganneau concluded, was "an entirely artificial tradition," probably influenced by the nearby Valley of Jehoshaphat—the traditional site of the Last Judgment in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic eschatology.</p>

<p>An alternative etymology suggests the name comes from the Arabic word sha'af (plural sha'fat), meaning mountaintop or summit. This would be fitting: Shuafat sits on elevated ground with clear sightlines to Jerusalem's domes and minarets.</p>

<p>Biblical historians have tried to connect Shuafat to places mentioned in scripture—Mizpah in Benjamin, Nob, or Gebim—but none of these identifications are certain. The past has a way of covering its tracks.</p>

<h2>Crusaders, Mamluks, and Ottomans</h2>

<p>The Crusaders knew the place as Dersophath or Dersophach. In March 1179, its revenues were granted to the Abbey of St. Mary of Mount Zion. A Crusader-era structure survives in fragmentary form. The nineteenth-century French explorer Victor Guérin thought it might be a small church; the local name for it was El-Kniseh, Arabic for "the church." He noted pointed windows and fine ashlar masonry reused from ancient buildings.</p>

<p>But the German archaeologist Conrad Schick, visiting later, found no church—just a thick-walled building with two preserved windows, constructed in typical Crusader fashion with a slightly elevated central vault. He thought it was a khan, a kind of inn or caravansary for travelers. A Muslim shrine, the tomb of Sheikh 'Abd-allah, was later built on top of whatever the original structure had been.</p>

<p>The Mamluk period (1260–1516) left its mark in the form of agricultural terraces, the sort of patient landscape engineering that transforms hillsides into productive farmland. When the Ottoman Empire absorbed Palestine in 1517, Shuafat appeared in tax registers as a small village of eight Muslim families paying taxes on wheat, barley, vineyards, and other produce—a total of 2,200 akçe.</p>

<p>The Ottomans would hold the area for exactly four centuries.</p>

<h2>A Village on an Elevated Plateau</h2>

<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, European travelers were passing through and recording their impressions. The American Biblical scholar Edward Robinson, visiting in 1838, described Shuafat as a small Muslim village with the remains of an old wall. The French archaeologist Louis Félicien de Saulcy, who saw it in 1851, wrote that "this village has the appearance of a castle of the middle ages with a square keep."</p>

<p>When Guérin visited in 1863, he found about 150 inhabitants living in houses that were "for the most part fairly old and vaulted internally." He was struck by the view: from this elevated plateau, one could "make out perfectly the cupolas and minarets of Jerusalem." An Ottoman census around 1870 counted 23 houses and 90 men (women were not counted). The British Palestine Exploration Fund's survey of 1883 described "a small village, standing on a flat spur immediately west of the watershed, surrounded with olive-trees," with wells to the north and a sacred chapel dedicated to Sultan Ibrahim.</p>

<p>The Ottomans built a road through Shuafat, following the route of the ancient Roman road that connected Jerusalem to Nablus (the city the Romans called Flavia Neapolis, built near the ruins of biblical Shechem). This road had carried traffic for nearly two thousand years.</p>

<p>By 1896, the population had grown to about 276. The 1922 British census counted 422, all Muslims. By 1931, it was 539, still all Muslims, living in 123 houses. The 1945 statistics showed 760 residents and over 5,000 dunams of land—a dunam being roughly a quarter of an acre—used for plantations, cereals, and a small built-up area.</p>

<h2>The Partition That Never Happened</h2>

<p>In 1947, as the British prepared to withdraw from Palestine and the United Nations debated how to divide the territory, Shuafat was designated as the northernmost point of a proposed "corpus separatum"—a special zone for Jerusalem and its surrounding villages that would be placed under international control. The idea was that Jerusalem, "in view of its association with three world religions," deserved separate treatment from the rest of Palestine.</p>

<p>This never happened.</p>

<p>In mid-February 1948, with war already breaking out between Jewish and Arab forces, Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni—the leader of Palestinian irregular fighters in the area—tried to persuade Shuafat's residents to attack the neighboring Jewish village of Neve Ya'akov. They refused.</p>

<p>On May 13, 1948, just before Israel declared independence, the villagers were evacuated on orders from the Arab Legion, the British-trained army of Jordan. The Palmach—the elite strike force of the pre-state Jewish military—then captured Shuafat, destroying many of its buildings. Jordan subsequently occupied the area and annexed the West Bank in April 1950.</p>

<p>King Hussein of Jordan built a palace at Shuafat. By 1961, the population had recovered to 2,541, including 253 Christians.</p>

<h2>The Refugee Camp: A History of Forced Moves</h2>

<p>Next to the neighborhood of Shuafat sits the Shuafat refugee camp, but the camp's origins lie elsewhere—in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.</p>

<p>After the 1948 war, the Red Cross housed Palestinian refugees in the depopulated Jewish Quarter, where Jews had lived for centuries before being expelled by Jordanian forces. This ad hoc settlement grew into the Muaska refugee camp, managed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), housing refugees from 48 locations now inside Israel. Over time, poor non-refugees also moved in. The old Jewish buildings deteriorated. Sanitation failed. Conditions became unsafe.</p>

<p>Neither UNRWA nor the Jordanian government wanted the international backlash that would come from demolishing the historic Jewish houses. But something had to be done.</p>

<p>In 1964, authorities decided to move the refugees to a new camp on land near Shuafat—land that had been mostly Jewish-owned before 1948. The refugees resisted. Moving meant abandoning their livelihoods near the Old City's markets and tourists, and losing easy access to holy sites. Many were eventually relocated by force during 1965 and 1966.</p>

<p>Then came the Six-Day War of June 1967. Israel captured East Jerusalem, including both the Shuafat neighborhood and the refugee camp, and later annexed them. Residents were offered Israeli citizenship. Most refused, viewing the annexation as illegal occupation. Many accepted permanent residency status instead—a status that grants most of the practical rights of citizenship without the political acknowledgment of Israeli sovereignty.</p>

<h2>One Place, Two Realities</h2>

<p>The Shuafat refugee camp is unique: the only Palestinian refugee camp inside Jerusalem or any other Israeli-administered area. Its residents carry Jerusalem identity cards, granting them the same privileges as Israeli residents. Yet the camp itself is largely serviced by UNRWA, even though 40 to 50 percent of its current residents are not registered refugees but people who moved there later.</p>

<p>The Israeli West Bank barrier—the controversial wall and fence system that Israel began building in the early 2000s—was partially constructed between the camp and the rest of Shuafat and Jerusalem. Some Israeli health clinics operate inside the camp, but the Israeli presence is otherwise limited to checkpoints controlling entry and exit.</p>

<p>This creates a peculiar security vacuum. Israeli police rarely enter the camp due to safety concerns. The Palestinian Civil Police Force does not operate in Israeli-administered areas. According to the Israeli advocacy group Ir Amim, the camp suffers from high crime rates as a result. Unlike other UNRWA camps, residents of Shuafat camp pay taxes to Israeli authorities—taxation without, critics might say, much representation or service in return.</p>

<h2>Land, Building, and the "Green Zone"</h2>

<p>According to the Applied Research Institute Jerusalem, a Palestinian organization, Israel has confiscated nearly 4,000 dunams of Shuafat's land—47 percent of the town's original area—to establish five Israeli settlements or neighborhoods: Ramat Shlomo, Ramot, Ramat Eshkol, Pisgat Amir, and French Hill. Israeli authorities describe these as neighborhoods of Jerusalem; Palestinians and most of the international community consider them settlements built on occupied territory.</p>

<p>The Shuafat Ridge, adjacent to the Palestinian neighborhood, was declared a "green zone" by Israeli authorities—ostensibly for environmental protection, but effectively preventing Palestinian construction. Teddy Kollek, Jerusalem's longtime mayor, openly admitted the real purpose: the green zone designation would be unfrozen when the time was right to build a new Jewish neighborhood there.</p>

<p>In July 2001, Israeli authorities demolished 14 houses under construction in Shuafat on orders from then-mayor Ehud Olmert, who said the structures lacked building permits. The families acknowledged they did not own the land—they had built on what they understood to be permission from Islamic Trust religious authorities—but argued that obtaining legal permits was nearly impossible for Palestinians. Olmert said the houses were on public land in a green zone and posed a security threat to nearby Pisgat Ze'ev.</p>

<p>Isabel Kershner of the New York Times, visiting in 2007, described Shuafat as suffering from an absence of municipal planning, overcrowding, and potholed roads—the infrastructure deficits that accumulate when a community exists in political limbo.</p>

<h2>Sovereignty and Its Discontents</h2>

<p>A survey conducted for the book Negotiating Jerusalem in 2000 found that 59 percent of Israeli Jews supported redrawing Jerusalem's boundaries to exclude Arab neighborhoods like Shuafat. The goal, respondents said, was to ensure a "Jewish majority" in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>When Ehud Olmert became prime minister, he questioned whether annexing areas like Shuafat had been wise. An Israeli proposal to transfer control of the area to the Palestinian Authority split the community. A camp official favored coming under Palestinian sovereignty. But the neighborhood's mukhtar—the traditional village headman—rejected the idea. His residents voted in Israeli elections, he noted. And under Palestinian control, what would stop rocket attacks on Israel from being launched nearby?</p>

<p>This is the dilemma of Shuafat: a place where residents pay Israeli taxes but receive few Israeli services, where they can vote in Jerusalem municipal elections but many refuse on principle, where they live inside the Israeli-drawn boundaries of Jerusalem but do not consider themselves part of Israel, where the wall separates neighbors from neighbors, and where seven thousand years of intermittent settlement have left layer upon layer of contested meaning beneath their feet.</p>

<p>The wealthy Jewish families who settled here after 70 CE, hoping for the Temple's restoration, eventually fled or were killed. The Crusaders came and went. The Mamluks terraced the hillsides. The Ottomans collected taxes for four centuries. The British drew their maps. The Jordanians built a palace. The Israelis built a wall.</p>

<p>And still people live on this elevated plateau, from which one can make out perfectly the domes and minarets of Jerusalem.</p>
