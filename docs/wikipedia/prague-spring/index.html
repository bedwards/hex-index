        I've written the Prague Spring article. Here's the rewritten essay:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring">Wikipedia: Prague Spring</a></p>

<p>On the night of August 20th, 1968, half a million soldiers from four different countries poured across the Czechoslovak border. They came with tanks, armored vehicles, and what The New York Times described as "the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue." Their mission: to crush a revolution that had produced not a single shot fired in anger.</p>

<p>The Prague Spring lasted exactly seven months and sixteen days. It began with a bureaucratic shuffle—one communist leader replacing another—and ended with the largest military invasion in Europe since World War II. In between, something remarkable happened: a country tried to build "socialism with a human face," and for a brief moment, it almost worked.</p>

<h2>The Reluctant Revolutionary</h2>

<p>Alexander Dubček was nobody's idea of a radical. He had spent his entire adult life as a loyal Communist Party functionary, rising through the ranks in Slovakia with the patient diligence of a man who understood how to work within the system. When he replaced Antonín Novotný as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on January 5th, 1968, the change seemed almost cosmetic. In his first public statements, Dubček insisted his appointment would "further the goals of socialism and maintain the working class nature of the Party."</p>

<p>Novotný had been losing support for years. The economy was stagnating—the Soviet model of industrialization made little sense for a country that had been industrialized before the war—and his attempts at reform had only generated appetite for more. When Dubček and the economist Ota Šik challenged him at a Central Committee meeting, Novotný made a fatal miscalculation: he invited Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to Prague, expecting support.</p>

<p>Brezhnev arrived and discovered that Novotný had almost no allies left.</p>

<p>He withdrew his backing.</p>

<h2>Testing the Boundaries</h2>

<p>The first real signal that something had changed came on February 4th, less than a month after Dubček took power. Eduard Goldstücker, a scholar who had just become chairman of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers, appeared on television and did something unprecedented: he criticized Novotný directly, on camera, explaining exactly how the former leader's policies had prevented progress in Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>Everyone waited for the consequences. Under the old regime, such public criticism would have ended a career—or worse. But nothing happened. Goldstücker suffered no repercussions at all.</p>

<p>This was the crack in the dam. Within weeks, the Union's journal—renamed Literární listy and published without censors for the first time—had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most widely published periodical in Europe. Television began hosting discussions where students could question writers and political figures openly. Former political prisoners appeared on screen alongside the secret police officers who had interrogated them.</p>

<p>For the first time in two decades, Czechoslovaks could talk about their own history.</p>

<h2>The Action Programme</h2>

<p>In April, Dubček launched what he called the "Action Programme"—a blueprint for transformation that reads, even now, as remarkably ambitious. It proposed loosening restrictions on the press, on speech, on travel. It suggested moving toward a multiparty government. It called for limiting the power of the secret police and reorganizing the country into a federation of two equal republics, Czech and Slovak.</p>

<p>The document was careful. Its authors went out of their way not to criticize the Communist regime's past actions, framing everything as policies that had simply "outlived their usefulness." They specified that reform would proceed under Communist Party direction. They proposed a ten-year transition period.</p>

<p>None of this caution mattered to Moscow.</p>

<p>The Action Programme's core philosophy was captured in a single sentence: "Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy." This was, from the Soviet perspective, heresy dressed up in Marxist language. If socialism could provide more freedom than Western democracy, what justification remained for one-party rule?</p>

<h2>The Summer of Anxiety</h2>

<p>Reactions across the Eastern Bloc split along predictable lines. Hungary's János Kádár—who had himself navigated the aftermath of his country's 1956 uprising—initially supported Dubček. Poland's Władysław Gomułka worried less about the reforms themselves than about what the Czechoslovak press was saying about the Soviet model. East Germany's leaders watched nervously, remembering their own workers' revolt of 1953.</p>

<p>In March, the "Warsaw Five"—the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and East Germany—summoned Czechoslovak representatives to Dresden. The questioning was pointed. Any talk of "democratization," the Soviets suggested, amounted to veiled criticism of their entire system.</p>

<p>By May, the KGB had launched Operation Progress, infiltrating pro-democratic organizations within Czechoslovakia. Soviet agents joined the reviving Socialist and Christian Democrat parties, gathering intelligence and building networks for what was to come.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary meeting took place in late July at Čierna nad Tisou, a town on the Soviet border. For the first time in history, nearly the entire Soviet Politburo traveled outside their own country for negotiations. They met the full Czechoslovak Presidium in a rail car, the two sides arguing for four days.</p>

<p>Dubček tried to walk an impossible line. He defended his reforms while pledging loyalty to the Warsaw Pact. He promised to curb "anti-socialist" tendencies while insisting that opening the press had been necessary. He agreed to prevent the revival of the Social Democratic Party while maintaining that the Communist Party could lead a more pluralistic society.</p>

<p>Brezhnev appeared to accept a compromise. The Soviets would withdraw troops that had been conducting "exercises" in Czechoslovakia since June. The September Party Congress would proceed as planned.</p>

<p>Three weeks later, the tanks rolled in.</p>

<h2>The Invasion That Wasn't Supposed to Happen</h2>

<p>The August 21st invasion involved forces from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland—a deliberate demonstration of Warsaw Pact unity. Romania refused to participate, as did Albania, which had already broken with Moscow years earlier. The military planners expected the operation to last four days.</p>

<p>It took eight months to fully suppress resistance.</p>

<p>The Czechoslovak response became a case study in what scholars call "civilian-based defense." There was no military resistance—the Czechoslovak army stayed in its barracks, ordered to stand down—but the population found countless ways to make occupation ungovernable. Street signs were removed or switched to misdirect convoys. Curfews were openly defied. Citizens surrounded Soviet tanks and tried to engage soldiers in conversation, asking why they had come to a country that posed no threat.</p>

<p>The most famous act of protest came in January 1969, when a twenty-year-old philosophy student named Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague's Wenceslas Square. He left a note explaining that he was the first of a group prepared to sacrifice themselves to demand an end to censorship and the withdrawal of occupying forces. Other self-immolations followed. None achieved their political aims, but they seared the Prague Spring into the world's conscience.</p>

<h2>Normalization</h2>

<p>The word the new regime chose for what came next was "normalization"—normalizace in Czech, a term that carried its own dark irony. What it meant in practice was the systematic reversal of everything Dubček had attempted.</p>

<p>Gustáv Husák, who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and eventually became President, had himself been a victim of Stalinist persecution in the 1950s. He had spent six years in prison on fabricated charges. Now he presided over a new wave of purges, expelling reformers from the Party and from public life.</p>

<p>The scale was staggering. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs. Writers who had published freely were banned. Academics were dismissed from universities. The country's entire intellectual class was driven underground or into exile.</p>

<p>Milan Kundera, who had been a prominent voice of the Prague Spring, eventually left for France. His novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, published in 1984, would become the era's most famous literary monument—a meditation on fate, chance, and the weight of living under occupation. Václav Havel, a playwright who had been part of the same cultural ferment, stayed in Czechoslovakia and kept writing. His plays were performed abroad while being banned at home. He spent years in prison for his dissident activities.</p>

<p>The poet Karel Kryl escaped to West Germany on the night of the invasion and never returned while the communist regime lasted. From exile, he recorded songs that were smuggled back into Czechoslovakia on cassette tapes, becoming the voice of a generation that had lost its country.</p>

<h2>The Kafka Conference</h2>

<p>One of the strangest precursors to the Prague Spring was a three-day academic symposium held in May 1963 at a castle in Liblice. The subject was Franz Kafka—the Prague-born writer who had died in 1924 and whose works had been suppressed throughout the Eastern Bloc as decadent and bourgeois.</p>

<p>The conference seems, at first glance, like an unlikely spark for revolution. Scholars presented papers on alienation in The Trial, on the nature of bureaucracy in The Castle. But the discussion kept circling back to questions that couldn't be asked directly: What happens when individuals are crushed by impersonal systems? How do people maintain their humanity under regimes that deny their basic dignity?</p>

<p>Representatives from every Eastern Bloc country attended—except the Soviet Union, which sent no one. This absence was itself a statement. The conference ended with Kafka's rehabilitation, his books returning to Czechoslovak libraries and bookstores. But more importantly, it demonstrated that ideas could flow across borders, that intellectuals could create space for dissent within the framework of officially sanctioned culture.</p>

<p>The path from a literary conference about a long-dead author to tanks in the streets took five years. But the connection was real. The Prague Spring was, at its heart, an argument about whether socialism could accommodate human freedom—the same question Kafka had been asking, in his own oblique way, half a century earlier.</p>

<h2>What Survived</h2>

<p>Almost nothing of Dubček's reforms outlasted the invasion. Almost nothing.</p>

<p>The one exception was the federation. The decision to reorganize Czechoslovakia into two republics—Czech and Slovak—had been implemented before the tanks arrived, and the Soviets chose not to reverse it. This administrative restructuring, the most bureaucratic and least threatening of all the Prague Spring's innovations, turned out to be the only one with lasting consequences.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years later, when Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into two separate nations, the framework for that divorce already existed. The Velvet Revolution of 1989 finally ended communist rule, and the Velvet Divorce of 1993 ended the country itself. Both events were so peaceful they earned those gentle names. The foundations for both had been laid in 1968.</p>

<p>Dubček himself lived to see it. After decades of forced obscurity—he had been demoted to a forestry inspector in Slovakia—he emerged in 1989 to stand alongside Václav Havel on a balcony overlooking hundreds of thousands of demonstrators in Prague. The crowd chanted his name. He became chairman of the federal parliament. He died in a car accident in 1992, one year before the country he had tried to reform ceased to exist.</p>

<h2>The Brezhnev Doctrine</h2>

<p>The invasion of Czechoslovakia formalized a principle that Soviet leaders had applied informally for years. In November 1968, Brezhnev articulated what became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine: any threat to socialist rule in any Eastern Bloc country was a threat to all of them, and all of them had the right—indeed, the duty—to intervene.</p>

<p>This doctrine governed Soviet policy for the next two decades. It was invoked to justify the presence of Soviet troops throughout Eastern Europe, to discourage any reform that might loosen Moscow's control, to make clear that 1956 in Hungary and 1968 in Czechoslovakia could happen again to anyone who strayed too far.</p>

<p>The doctrine's abandonment came as suddenly as its proclamation. In 1989, as communist regimes collapsed across Eastern Europe, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev declined to intervene. His spokesman, Gennadi Gerasimov, was asked what had happened to the Brezhnev Doctrine. He replied that it had been replaced by the "Sinatra Doctrine": the Eastern European countries could now do it their way.</p>

<p>The last Soviet troops left Czechoslovakia in 1991, twenty-three years after they arrived.</p>

<h2>Socialism With a Human Face</h2>

<p>The phrase that defined the Prague Spring—"socialism with a human face"—sounds almost quaint now, a relic of a time when people still believed that socialism and democracy might be compatible, that the Soviet model was a distortion rather than an inevitable outcome. Dubček and his allies genuinely believed they could build something new: a system that retained the economic principles of Marxism while granting the freedoms that Western democracies took for granted.</p>

<p>They were wrong about the compatibility. The Soviet Union would not permit the experiment to continue, not because it feared failure but because it feared success. If Czechoslovakia could prove that socialism worked better with freedom, the entire justification for Soviet-style authoritarianism collapsed.</p>

<p>But the Prague Spring demonstrated something else—that ordinary people, given the chance, will reach for freedom even when the odds are hopeless. The resistance that greeted the invasion wasn't organized by any political party or directed by any leader. It emerged spontaneously from a population that had tasted seven months of openness and refused to surrender it without a fight.</p>

<p>That resistance failed, measured by its immediate aims. Censorship returned. The reformers were purged. Twenty years of normalization followed. But measured by what it revealed about human nature—about the stubborn, impractical, doomed insistence on dignity—the Prague Spring succeeded in ways its architects never anticipated. The people who removed street signs and argued with tank crews and set themselves on fire in public squares weren't calculating their odds. They were asserting something about who they were and what they believed.</p>

<p>Some things are worth doing even when they cannot succeed.</p>
