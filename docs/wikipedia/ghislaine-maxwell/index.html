        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Ghislaine Maxwell Wikipedia article for your reading library. The piece:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the contrast between her privileged upbringing and her eventual conviction
- Traces her life chronologically from her birth in France through her father's empire, his death and disgrace, her reinvention in New York, her relationship with Epstein, and ultimately her conviction
- Explains context that may not be obvious (what the Kit-Cat Club was, who the Huguenots were, what a Wang 2200 computer was)
- Varies sentence and paragraph length for better audio listening
- Ends with a reflection on what her case reveals about power, social networks, and institutional failure

The essay runs approximately 2,800 words, which should provide around 15-20 minutes of reading time with Speechify. Would you like me to save it to a specific location, or would you like any adjustments to the content?
