        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Soviet education. The essay transforms the encyclopedic source material into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The dramatic statistic about women's literacy in 1897 vs. the achievement four decades later
2. **Tells a story** - Following the chronological arc from tsarist illiteracy through revolution, collapse, and reconstruction
3. **Varies sentence and paragraph length** - Short punchy paragraphs ("It was a disaster.") mixed with longer explanatory sections
4. **Spells out acronyms** - PTU, VUZ, and other Soviet abbreviations are explained
5. **Explains from first principles** - The korenizatsiya policy, the three-tier system, and the VUZ structure are all built up step by step
6. **Adds interesting connections** - The Lysenko affair, the comparison with Western military academies, the irony of the 1920s progressive education experiment failing
7. **Ends with synthesis** - A reflection on the tension between mass education as liberation vs. indoctrination

The essay runs approximately 2,500 words (roughly 12-15 minutes reading time with Speechify), keeping it substantive while being accessible for audio listening.

However, I notice I'm encountering permission issues creating the output directory. The content is ready - would you like me to output it a different way, or can you grant the directory creation permission?
