        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about maternal deprivation. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a compelling hook** - Bowlby's encounter with an affectionless teenage thief
2. **Follows a narrative arc** - from historical ignorance, through early researchers, to Bowlby's breakthrough work and its lasting impact
3. **Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths** - creating rhythm suitable for text-to-speech
4. **Explains technical terms** - like "anaclitic depression" (from the Greek for "leaning upon") and "ethology" (the study of animal behavior)
5. **Includes memorable details** - the pediatrician who replaced the hand-washing sign with "Do not enter without picking up a baby"
6. **Connects to the related Substack article** - the essay's focus on maternal care and its effects on mental health directly relates to the article on maternal desire

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/maternal-deprivation/index.html` once you grant write permission.
