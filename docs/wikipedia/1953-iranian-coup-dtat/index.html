<p>In the summer of 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency and British intelligence orchestrated the overthrow of a democratically elected leader in Iran. They did it to protect oil profits. The aftershocks of that decision would reverberate for decades, ultimately contributing to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and shaping the fraught relationship between Iran and the West that persists today.</p>

<p>This is the story of how two Western powers toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh, a man whose crime was believing that Iran's oil should benefit Iranians.</p>

<h2>The Chess Game for Persia</h2>

<p>Long before oil entered the picture, Iran—then called Persia—found itself squeezed between two expanding empires. From the north came Russia, pushing ever southward. From the south and west came Britain, protecting its route to India and its expanding commercial interests.</p>

<p>In 1892, British diplomat George Curzon captured the dynamic with chilling clarity. Iran, he wrote, was nothing more than "pieces on a chessboard upon which is being played out a game for the dominion of the world."</p>

<p>The Iranian people were not consulted about their role as pawns.</p>

<p>Throughout the late 1800s, Iran's monarchs sold off their country piece by piece. In 1872, a British entrepreneur named Paul Reuter struck an extraordinary deal with Naser al-Din Shah Qajar. In exchange for funding the Shah's extravagant European vacation, Reuter would receive exclusive rights to Iranian roads, telegraphs, factories, and natural resources. The terms were staggering: Reuter would pocket sixty percent of all net revenue for twenty years.</p>

<p>The deal collapsed under pressure from both domestic outrage and Russian opposition. But it established a pattern that would repeat: foreign interests acquiring Iranian resources at terms that primarily benefited foreigners.</p>

<h2>The Birth of British Oil in Iran</h2>

<p>In 1901, another Shah, Mozzafar al-Din, granted a sixty-year petroleum concession to William Knox D'Arcy, a wealthy British entrepreneur. D'Arcy paid twenty thousand pounds—substantial money at the time, equivalent to roughly 2.6 million pounds today—and promised Iran sixteen percent of future net profits.</p>

<p>Sixteen percent. Of net profits. As calculated by the company.</p>

<p>For seven years, D'Arcy's team drilled without success. Then, on May 26, 1908, at a depth of 1,180 feet, they struck oil. It was one of the largest petroleum discoveries in history.</p>

<p>The find transformed Britain's strategic calculations. When World War One erupted, the British government bought a controlling stake in what had become the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The British navy was converting from coal to oil, and controlling Persian oil suddenly became a matter of national survival.</p>

<p>For Iran, the math was simple and brutal. British companies extracted Iranian oil, processed it at the Abadan refinery—the largest in the world—and sold it globally. Iran received a fraction of the proceeds while foreign technicians ran the operations and British managers made the decisions.</p>

<h2>Democracy Interrupted</h2>

<p>The Iranians did not accept foreign domination passively. In 1905 and 1906, massive popular protests forced the Shah to accept a constitution that established a parliament, limited royal power, and created the position of prime minister. It was a genuine democratic revolution, Iran's first.</p>

<p>Britain and Russia opposed it immediately. They backed the Shah's son, Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar, who attempted to destroy the new parliament by force. A guerrilla movement led by a man named Sattar Khan eventually deposed him in 1910, but the constitutional experiment remained fragile.</p>

<p>By 1921, after years of chaos and mismanagement under the Qajar dynasty, a military officer named Reza Khan rose to power—reportedly with British backing. Within four years, parliament voted to remove the last Qajar Shah and crown Reza Khan as Reza Shah Pahlavi, founder of a new dynasty.</p>

<p>Reza Shah was a modernizer and an autocrat. He built roads and schools and suppressed all opposition. He tried to renegotiate the oil concession on better terms but found that Iran remained too weak to challenge British interests directly. The best he could manage was a modest renegotiation that still heavily favored the British.</p>

<p>Among those he imprisoned was a politician named Mohammad Mosaddegh. The experience would shape Mosaddegh's entire political philosophy.</p>

<h2>World War and Its Aftermath</h2>

<p>When World War Two began, Reza Shah declared neutrality and tried to balance between the various powers. Britain and the Soviet Union were not interested in Iranian neutrality. In 1941, they invaded.</p>

<p>The stated reasons were strategic: they needed to secure Iranian oil fields and use the Trans-Iranian Railway to supply the Soviet war effort against Nazi Germany. They also wanted to eliminate German influence in Iran. But the invasion's most significant outcome was deposing Reza Shah and installing his twenty-two-year-old son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, as the new Shah.</p>

<p>The British chose the young Shah precisely because they believed he would be easier to control than his father.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the 1940s, the new Shah governed tentatively. Many of his father's authoritarian measures were rolled back. Iranian democracy experienced a genuine, if incomplete, revival.</p>

<p>But the fundamental problem remained: the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company continued extracting vast wealth from Iranian soil while Iranians saw little benefit.</p>

<h2>The Fifty-Fifty Question</h2>

<p>To understand what came next, you need to understand what was happening elsewhere in the oil world.</p>

<p>In 1950, the Arabian American Oil Company—known as ARAMCO—reached a landmark agreement with Saudi Arabia: a fifty-fifty split of oil profits. The deal infuriated Britain but established a new baseline for what oil-producing nations could demand.</p>

<p>Iranians looked at the Saudi arrangement and then at their own sixteen percent and asked an obvious question: Why?</p>

<p>Mohammad Mosaddegh had an answer. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should not merely share more profits. It should be nationalized entirely. Iranian oil should belong to Iran.</p>

<h2>Mosaddegh's Rise</h2>

<p>Mosaddegh was an aristocrat with connections to the former Qajar dynasty—which made his relationship with the Pahlavi Shah complicated from the start. He was also a committed democrat who believed the Shah should reign ceremonially, like European constitutional monarchs, rather than wielding real political power.</p>

<p>In 1949, after surviving an assassination attempt, the Shah began expanding his authority. He finally convened the Senate that the 1906 constitution had authorized but that had never actually met. Since the Shah had the right to appoint half the senators, he used this power to stack the body with loyalists.</p>

<p>Mosaddegh viewed these moves as dangerous steps toward autocracy. He helped organize the National Front, a coalition of parties opposed to the Shah's growing power and united by a common goal: oil nationalization.</p>

<p>By 1951, the National Front had won a majority in the Majlis, Iran's parliament. The sitting prime minister, Haj Ali Razmara, opposed nationalization. A religious extremist assassinated him.</p>

<p>Parliament then selected Mosaddegh as the new prime minister. Under Iran's constitution, the Shah was required to confirm parliament's choice. He did so, likely calculating that he had little alternative given the political momentum behind the nationalization movement.</p>

<h2>The Nationalization Crisis</h2>

<p>On May 1, 1951, Mosaddegh's government nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Iranian oil would henceforth be managed by the National Iranian Oil Company. Foreign corporate representatives were expelled.</p>

<p>Britain's response was immediate and multifaceted. The British government considered military action, potentially seizing the Abadan refinery by force. Prime Minister Clement Attlee ultimately rejected that option as too provocative.</p>

<p>Instead, Britain organized a global boycott of Iranian oil. British technicians were withdrawn. The Royal Navy intercepted tankers. Major oil companies around the world agreed not to purchase Iranian crude or help Iran refine and market its oil.</p>

<p>The boycott devastated Iran's economy. But Mosaddegh refused to back down.</p>

<h2>America's Shifting Stance</h2>

<p>Initially, the United States tried to broker a compromise. The Truman administration was uncomfortable with British colonialism and wary of setting a precedent by using the CIA to overthrow a government. As late as 1952, American officials were considering ways to assist Mosaddegh.</p>

<p>Everything changed with Eisenhower's election in November 1952.</p>

<p>The new administration viewed the world through a Cold War lens. Mosaddegh's government had not aligned with the Soviet Union, but the Iranian Communist party—known as the Tudeh—was growing more influential. American officials convinced themselves that if Mosaddegh remained in power, Iran might eventually fall into the Soviet orbit.</p>

<p>In reality, Mosaddegh was a nationalist, not a communist. But in the ideological climate of the early 1950s, the distinction seemed less important than the perceived risk.</p>

<p>British intelligence officials had been lobbying for American involvement in a coup. They found willing partners in the new administration. Winston Churchill, back as British prime minister, and John Foster Dulles, the new American secretary of state, agreed that Mosaddegh had to go.</p>

<h2>Operation Ajax</h2>

<p>The CIA called it Operation Ajax. British intelligence called it Operation Boot. The plan involved bribery, propaganda, and orchestrated chaos.</p>

<p>American and British agents paid Iranian newspaper editors to run anti-Mosaddegh articles. They hired provocateurs to stage demonstrations and commit violence that could be blamed on the left. They bribed politicians, military officers, and—crucially—some of Tehran's most feared mob bosses.</p>

<p>The first attempt to overthrow Mosaddegh failed. On August 15, 1953, the Shah signed royal decrees dismissing Mosaddegh and appointing General Fazlollah Zahedi as the new prime minister. But Mosaddegh learned of the plot and had the officers delivering the decree arrested. The Shah fled the country, first to Baghdad and then to Rome.</p>

<p>It looked like the coup had collapsed. CIA officers in Tehran cabled Washington that the operation had failed.</p>

<p>But the agents on the ground did not give up. On August 19, paid mobs flooded Tehran's streets, ostensibly demanding the Shah's return. Men transported into the city by truck and bus overwhelmed government supporters. The violence killed between two hundred and three hundred people.</p>

<p>By evening, General Zahedi emerged from hiding and announced that he was taking control. The Shah flew back from Rome in triumph. Mosaddegh was arrested at his home.</p>

<h2>The Aftermath</h2>

<p>Mosaddegh was tried for treason by a military court—not an impartial civilian court—and sentenced to three years in prison. After serving his sentence, he was placed under house arrest, where he remained until his death in 1967. Other supporters of his government faced imprisonment or execution.</p>

<p>The Shah now ruled without meaningful constraint. Over the following years, he built an increasingly authoritarian state, backed by American military and economic support. His secret police, known by its Persian acronym SAVAK, became notorious for torture and repression.</p>

<p>A new oil consortium was established, giving American companies a forty percent stake—the reward, perhaps, for the CIA's role in the coup. British Petroleum retained a forty percent share. The nationalization was effectively undone, though the fiction of Iranian ownership was maintained.</p>

<p>The Shah would rule for another twenty-six years.</p>

<h2>The Long Shadow</h2>

<p>In 1979, a revolution swept Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from power. The revolutionaries who seized the American embassy and held its staff hostage for 444 days remembered the 1953 coup well. To them, it was proof that America could never be trusted, that it would always place its interests above Iranian democracy.</p>

<p>For decades, the American and British governments denied any involvement in Mosaddegh's overthrow. The cover story held that Iranians had removed him on their own, that the CIA and MI6 were merely observers.</p>

<p>In 2000, then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged American involvement, calling it a "setback for Iran's political development." In August 2013, the U.S. government released declassified documents that revealed the full extent of CIA planning and direction. The documents showed that the coup was "carried out under CIA direction" and was "an act of U.S. foreign policy, conceived and approved at the highest levels of government."</p>

<p>In 2023, marking the seventieth anniversary, the CIA formally took credit for the operation.</p>

<h2>What Might Have Been</h2>

<p>History offers no controlled experiments. We cannot know what would have happened if Mosaddegh had remained in power. Perhaps the Tudeh would have grown stronger. Perhaps the government would have collapsed under economic pressure. Perhaps Mosaddegh himself would have become authoritarian.</p>

<p>But we can observe what did happen. The coup installed a dictator who ruled through terror. It created grievances that fueled the 1979 revolution. It established a template for Cold War interventions that would be repeated in Guatemala, Chile, and elsewhere. It convinced a generation of Iranians—and others watching around the world—that Western rhetoric about democracy was hollow, that oil and geopolitics would always trump self-determination.</p>

<p>Mosaddegh's offense was believing that a nation's resources should primarily benefit its own people. For that belief, he lost his freedom, his country lost its democracy, and the reverberations continue still.</p>

<h2>The Uncomfortable Questions</h2>

<p>The 1953 coup forces us to confront uncomfortable questions about power and principle.</p>

<p>Britain claimed to support democracy but overthrew it when democracy threatened British profits. America claimed to defend freedom but installed a dictator when a free government seemed inconvenient. Both countries maintained for decades that they had done nothing wrong, that the official story of indigenous Iranian action was true.</p>

<p>The documents released in 2013 proved the lie. False flag attacks. Paid protesters. Bribed officials. Propaganda campaigns. All directed from Washington and London.</p>

<p>Understanding this history does not require believing that Mosaddegh was perfect or that his policies would have succeeded. It simply requires acknowledging what happened: two democracies conspired to destroy another democracy because that democracy's oil policies threatened corporate profits.</p>

<p>The Iranian people have not forgotten. Perhaps it is time the rest of us remembered as well.</p>
