<h2>The Philosopher Who Broke With His Master</h2>

<p>In May 1968, Paris erupted. Students occupied universities, workers launched the largest general strike in French history, and for a few weeks it seemed like the entire social order might collapse. Most philosophers watched from the sidelines, analyzing events through their existing theoretical frameworks. But for a young thinker named Jacques Rancière, those weeks in the streets changed everything.</p>

<p>Rancière had been a star pupil of Louis Althusser, the towering figure of French Marxism who had reimagined Marx's thought through the lens of structuralism. Together with Althusser and several other collaborators, Rancière had co-authored <em>Reading Capital</em> in 1965, a landmark work that treated Marx's masterpiece as a scientific text requiring rigorous philosophical interpretation. The book made Rancière's name in academic circles before he turned thirty.</p>

<p>Then came May '68.</p>

<p>Althusser's response to the uprising disappointed his protégé deeply. The master's theoretical apparatus, Rancière felt, left no room for what was actually happening—spontaneous popular revolt, workers and students acting without waiting for proper ideological guidance, people seizing history rather than being shaped by its forces. Althusser seemed to view the uprising as theoretically inconvenient, a messy deviation from how class struggle was supposed to work.</p>

<p>Rancière broke with him publicly. It was a rupture that would define his entire philosophical career.</p>

<h2>Listening to Workers Instead of Speaking for Them</h2>

<p>What bothered Rancière about Althusser—and about most radical philosophy—was the way intellectuals positioned themselves as the ones who truly understood the working class. The workers themselves, in this view, suffered from "false consciousness." They didn't grasp their own situation. They needed philosophers to explain their oppression to them and guide them toward liberation.</p>

<p>Rancière found this deeply condescending. Who were these bourgeois academics to claim superior insight into working-class experience?</p>

<p>He set out to do something different. Rather than theorizing about workers from above, he would investigate what workers actually thought, wrote, and dreamed. This led him to spend years in archives, reading letters and journals from nineteenth-century French laborers. What he discovered surprised him.</p>

<p>These workers weren't waiting for intellectuals to enlighten them. They were already doing their own thinking—and it wasn't always what Marxist theory predicted. Many didn't dream of seizing the means of production. They dreamed of writing poetry. Of staying up late to read philosophy. Of escaping the identity that society had assigned them.</p>

<p>This research became <em>The Nights of Labor</em>, published in French in 1981. The title refers to those precious hours after the workday ended, when laborers would forgo sleep to pursue intellectual and artistic endeavors. Rancière's workers weren't content to be "the working class" as defined by theorists. They wanted to become something else entirely.</p>

<h2>Les Révoltes Logiques: A Journal Against Condescension</h2>

<p>Between 1975 and 1981, Rancière helped lead an intellectual journal with a deliberately provocative name: <em>Les Révoltes Logiques</em>, which translates roughly as "Logical Revolts." The name contained a double meaning.</p>

<p>On one hand, it quoted a line from the French poet Arthur Rimbaud: "We'll smash all logical revolts." In context, Rimbaud was writing satirically in the voice of colonial powers crushing rational resistance. On the other hand, the phrase echoed a Maoist slogan popular among French radicals of the era: "It is right to revolt."</p>

<p>The journal's mission was to challenge how historians wrote about ordinary people. Too often, Rancière argued, working-class history treated its subjects as voiceless masses—objects of study rather than thinking beings with their own complex, contradictory ideas. Historians gave workers "historical treatment" while simultaneously rendering them mute.</p>

<p>Working alongside the feminist historian Geneviève Fraisse and others, Rancière pushed for what he called "history from below" that actually let people below speak. Not as representatives of their class, but as individuals with surprising and often uncomfortable things to say.</p>

<h2>The Ignorant Schoolmaster: A Radical Theory of Education</h2>

<p>In 1987, Rancière published what would become one of his most influential books: <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation</em>. On the surface, it tells the story of Joseph Jacotot, an obscure French educator from the early nineteenth century. But Rancière uses Jacotot's strange pedagogical experiments to advance a radical argument about equality and learning.</p>

<p>Jacotot had found himself in an unusual situation. Exiled to Belgium, he was asked to teach French to Flemish-speaking students. He spoke no Flemish. They spoke no French. Conventional teaching was impossible.</p>

<p>So Jacotot tried something desperate. He gave his students a bilingual edition of a novel—the French text on one side, Flemish translation on the other—and simply told them to figure it out. Learn the French by comparing it to the Flemish. No instruction. No explanation. Just the text and their own intelligence.</p>

<p>It worked. The students learned French, some of them remarkably well.</p>

<p>This accident led Jacotot to a startling conclusion: traditional teaching might actually impede learning. When a master explains something to a student, the implicit message is "you cannot understand this on your own—you need me to translate it into terms you can grasp." The student learns to depend on the teacher's intelligence rather than trusting their own.</p>

<p>Jacotot called this "stultification"—the process by which education makes people stupider by convincing them they need experts.</p>

<p>Rancière extended this into a general principle: all intelligence is equal. Not in the sense that everyone has identical abilities, but in the sense that anyone can learn anything if they apply their intelligence to it. The poor and disenfranchised don't need enlightened teachers to liberate them. They can liberate themselves.</p>

<blockquote>There is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies.</blockquote>

<h2>Politics as the Eruption of Equality</h2>

<p>Rancière developed a distinctive vocabulary for talking about politics, one that often inverts common usage. Understanding his terms helps unlock his thinking.</p>

<p>When most people say "politics," they mean the normal functioning of government—elections, legislation, policy debates, administration. Rancière calls all of this "the police order." Not police in the sense of officers with badges, but police in an older French sense: the management of the social body, the assignment of everyone to their proper place, the maintenance of order.</p>

<p>The police order determines who counts and who doesn't. Who gets to speak and who must remain silent. Who is visible and who is invisible. Every society has such an order, and it presents itself as natural, inevitable, comprehensive. Everyone has their role; everyone has their share.</p>

<p>Real politics, for Rancière, is something else entirely. It's the moment when those who have no part demand a part. When the uncounted insist on being counted. When people who are supposed to be silent start speaking and refuse to shut up.</p>

<p>Politics in this sense is always disruptive. It doesn't work within the existing order; it exposes that order's arbitrariness and incompleteness. It's fundamentally about equality—not equality as an abstract principle or distant goal, but equality enacted, equality demonstrated, equality made undeniable.</p>

<h2>Disagreement: When Understanding Fails</h2>

<p>Another key concept in Rancière's thought is what he calls "disagreement," though he means something more specific than ordinary disputes. A disagreement in his sense occurs when two parties cannot even agree on what they're arguing about—when one side literally doesn't hear or comprehend what the other is saying.</p>

<p>Imagine a worker demanding better conditions and an employer responding that there's nothing to discuss because workers are simply resources to be managed, not parties to a conversation. The employer doesn't disagree with the worker's arguments; the employer doesn't recognize that the worker is making arguments at all. This isn't a negotiation that could be resolved with better communication. It's a fundamental conflict about who gets to count as a speaking being.</p>

<p>Genuine politics emerges from such disagreements. It's the struggle to be heard by those who claim you have nothing to say.</p>

<h2>Post-Democracy and the Disappearance of Politics</h2>

<p>Rancière coined the term "post-democracy" to describe a condition he saw emerging in Western societies—and this was in the 1990s, well before the word became fashionable in political commentary.</p>

<p>Post-democracy doesn't mean the end of elections or democratic institutions. Those continue functioning. What disappears is genuine political conflict. Society comes to be managed by consensus. Experts determine optimal policies. Disagreement is reframed as either ignorance (which education can fix) or special interest (which negotiation can accommodate).</p>

<p>In post-democracy, the police order becomes so comprehensive that it seems to account for everyone. There's no longer any "part that has no part" demanding recognition. Politics in Rancière's sense becomes impossible because the very idea that the system might exclude anyone is unthinkable.</p>

<p>Of course, people are still excluded. But their exclusion is rendered invisible, unspeakable, literally incredible to those within the consensus.</p>

<h2>Aesthetics as Politics</h2>

<p>Later in his career, Rancière turned increasingly to questions of art and aesthetics. This might seem like a departure from his political concerns, but for him the two were always intertwined.</p>

<p>His concept of "the distribution of the sensible" captures this connection. Every social order determines what can be seen and what remains invisible, what can be said and what stays mute, who can speak as a political subject and who is merely noise. Aesthetic practices—art, literature, film, theater—can disrupt these distributions. They can make visible what was invisible, give voice to the voiceless, rearrange the boundaries of the perceptible.</p>

<p>Art doesn't do this by conveying political messages. Propaganda rarely disrupts anything. Rather, art at its most political reconfigures the field of experience itself. It changes what we're capable of sensing and imagining.</p>

<p>Rancière's aesthetic theory became influential in the art world. By 2006, his ideas had become a reference point in contemporary visual art, and he was lecturing at events like the Frieze Art Fair in London. His concept of "the emancipated spectator"—which challenges the idea that audiences need to be activated or awakened by art, arguing instead that watching is already an active, intelligent engagement—resonated with artists questioning assumptions about participation and passivity.</p>

<h2>The Philosopher and His Poor</h2>

<p>Throughout his work, Rancière remained skeptical of how philosophers relate to those they claim to champion. His 1983 book <em>The Philosopher and His Poor</em> examined this relationship historically, looking at how major thinkers from Plato onward have imagined and used "the poor" in their philosophies.</p>

<p>The pattern he found was consistent. Philosophers need the poor—as subjects of analysis, as justifications for their projects, as evidence for their theories. But this need comes with a kind of intellectual exploitation. The poor become raw material for philosophical production. Their voices are ventriloquized. Their experiences are translated into terms they wouldn't recognize.</p>

<p>This critique applied to Marxists as much as anyone. The proletariat in Marxist theory often bears little resemblance to actual workers with their messy, contradictory aspirations. The theory needs a certain kind of proletariat—properly class-conscious, historically destined—and finds ways to dismiss or explain away workers who don't fit the mold.</p>

<h2>Influence and Legacy</h2>

<p>Rancière's ideas have spread far beyond academic philosophy. His work on spectatorship influenced film theory, offering new ways to think about representation, politics, and audience engagement. Literary critics have cited him as a precursor to "postcritique," a movement questioning whether literary studies should focus primarily on exposing hidden meanings and ideological mystifications.</p>

<p>His educational philosophy, particularly <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</em>, has been taken up by teachers and theorists challenging conventional assumptions about expertise, authority, and the purpose of schooling. The book circulates in education schools alongside more conventional texts, often disturbing students who have never questioned the basic structure of instruction.</p>

<p>In mainstream French politics, the 2007 presidential candidate Ségolène Royal named Rancière as her favorite philosopher—a somewhat ironic honor given his critique of electoral politics as part of the police order rather than genuine political activity.</p>

<p>Gabriel Rockhill, who translated and edited several of Rancière's works for English-language audiences, has developed his own philosophical project in dialogue with Rancière's ideas, exploring the historical relationships between aesthetic and political transformations.</p>

<h2>A Philosophy Against Expertise</h2>

<p>If there's a single thread running through Rancière's decades of work, it might be this: a relentless suspicion of anyone claiming to know what others really need, really think, or really should become.</p>

<p>This suspicion began with his break from Althusser and the Marxist tradition of ideological analysis. It continued through his historical research on workers who refused to be what theorists said workers must be. It animated his educational philosophy, with its rejection of the master who enlightens the ignorant. It shaped his political thought, with its insistence that the excluded don't need vanguards to lead them.</p>

<p>Born in 1940, Rancière has continued writing and lecturing well into his eighties, publishing new work on time, landscape, fiction, and the uncertain present. He holds positions at the European Graduate School in Switzerland and as professor emeritus at the University of Paris VIII, the experimental university established after May '68 in the working-class suburb of Vincennes—later relocated to Saint-Denis.</p>

<p>His philosophy remains what it was from the beginning: aggressively anti-authoritarian, skeptical of expertise, committed to the proposition that equality is not a destination to be reached but a starting point to be asserted. Anyone can think. Anyone can learn. Anyone can speak.</p>

<p>The question is whether those with power are willing to listen.</p>
