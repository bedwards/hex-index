<h2>The Professor Who Became a Dictator</h2>

<p>On a spring day in 1992, tanks rolled through Lima. Soldiers surrounded the Peruvian Congress. The president himself had ordered them there—not to defend the legislature, but to shut it down. Alberto Fujimori, an agronomist and former university rector who had won the presidency just two years earlier as a political outsider, was staging a coup against his own government.</p>

<p>It was one of the most brazen power grabs in modern Latin American history. And remarkably, most Peruvians cheered.</p>

<p>To understand how a country could celebrate the destruction of its own democracy, you have to understand the chaos that preceded it. Peru in the late 1980s was a nation tearing itself apart. A Maoist guerrilla group called Sendero Luminoso—the Shining Path—was waging a brutal insurgency that would ultimately claim nearly seventy thousand lives. The economy had collapsed into hyperinflation so severe that prices could double in a matter of weeks. The previous president, Alan García, had left the country in what observers described as "economic and political chaos."</p>

<p>Into this maelstrom stepped Fujimori, a man almost nobody had heard of.</p>

<h2>The Accidental Candidate</h2>

<p>Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto was born in Lima on July 26, 1938, to Japanese immigrants from Kumamoto Prefecture who had arrived in Peru just four years earlier. His parents were Buddhists, but they had him baptized Catholic—a common pragmatic choice for immigrant families seeking to assimilate. At home, the family spoke Japanese. Outside, young Alberto navigated the world in Spanish, and eventually English and French as well.</p>

<p>Peruvians called him "el chino"—the Chinese guy. This might seem like an odd nickname for someone of Japanese heritage, but in Peru, as in much of Spanish-speaking Latin America, the term "chino" is applied broadly to anyone of East Asian descent. It can be derogatory or affectionate depending on context. Fujimori claimed to embrace it as a term of endearment from the people.</p>

<p>He was, by all accounts, academically brilliant. After graduating first in his class in agricultural engineering from the National Agrarian University, he pursued graduate studies in physics at the University of Strasbourg in France, then earned a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee on a Ford Foundation scholarship. His academic achievements were impressive enough that his university made him dean of the sciences faculty, and in 1984, appointed him rector—the equivalent of a university president.</p>

<p>He also hosted a television show. From 1988 to 1989, Fujimori appeared on a program called Concertando on Peru's state-owned network, Canal 7. For a mathematics professor and university administrator, he proved surprisingly comfortable in front of a camera. This media experience would serve him well in ways he could not yet imagine.</p>

<h2>The Dark Horse</h2>

<p>The 1990 Peruvian presidential election was supposed to be a coronation for Mario Vargas Llosa, the celebrated novelist who would later win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Vargas Llosa was running on a platform of aggressive neoliberal economic reform—privatization, deregulation, the whole Washington Consensus playbook that was then in vogue across Latin America.</p>

<p>Fujimori was barely a footnote in the race. He had founded a political party called Cambio 90—Change 90—but he was a complete unknown outside academic circles. His campaign seemed almost quixotic.</p>

<p>Then something unexpected happened.</p>

<p>Peruvian voters, exhausted by years of economic mismanagement and terrified by Vargas Llosa's promises of painful reforms, began looking for an alternative. Fujimori positioned himself as neither left nor right, but simply different—an outsider untainted by the political establishment that had brought the country to its knees. He was an engineer, a problem-solver, a technocrat who would approach governance rationally rather than ideologically.</p>

<p>At least, that was the pitch.</p>

<p>In the first round of voting, Fujimori shocked everyone by finishing second, forcing a runoff with Vargas Llosa. Left-wing groups and supporters of the outgoing García government, who despised Vargas Llosa's free-market agenda, threw their support behind the unknown professor. Fujimori won the runoff decisively.</p>

<p>With his victory, he became only the third person of East Asian descent to lead a South American nation, following Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henck Chin A Sen of Suriname.</p>

<h2>The Bait and Switch</h2>

<p>Fujimori had campaigned against the harsh neoliberal reforms proposed by Vargas Llosa. So his first major act as president came as a stunning betrayal to those who had voted for him: he implemented reforms even more aggressive than anything his opponent had proposed.</p>

<p>The program became known as the Fujishock.</p>

<p>Overnight, government subsidies vanished. Price controls disappeared. State-owned enterprises were put up for sale. The troubled currency, the inti, was replaced with a new one called the nuevo sol. Investment restrictions were eliminated. Tariffs were slashed.</p>

<p>The immediate human cost was staggering. Electricity prices quintupled. Water prices rose eightfold. Gasoline prices increased by three thousand percent. The government did establish a four hundred million dollar poverty relief fund, but this seemed almost laughably inadequate given the economic agony being inflicted on ordinary Peruvians.</p>

<p>Yet from a macroeconomic perspective, the shock therapy worked. Inflation, which had been running at catastrophic levels, began to fall rapidly. Foreign investment flooded in. The International Monetary Fund, or IMF—the global institution that provides loans to countries in financial distress, often in exchange for exactly these kinds of reforms—was pleased. Peru was welcomed back into the global economy.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, Fujimori was receiving guidance from Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian economist who had founded one of Latin America's first neoliberal think tanks, the Institute for Liberty and Democracy. De Soto had been receiving funding from the United States government since the Reagan administration, and he proved so influential that some observers dubbed him the "informal president." Between 1988 and 1995, de Soto and his organization were responsible for some four hundred initiatives, laws, and regulations that fundamentally transformed Peru's economic system.</p>

<h2>The Self-Coup</h2>

<p>By 1992, Fujimori had grown frustrated. Despite his sweeping economic reforms, he faced a Congress still controlled by his opponents. The legislature, he complained, was blocking his efforts to combat the Shining Path insurgency. Public opinion was on his side—in one poll, Congress had the approval of just seventeen percent of voters, while Fujimori himself stood at forty-two percent.</p>

<p>But what happened next was not a spontaneous reaction to political gridlock. Documents later revealed that Fujimori and his military handlers had been planning a coup for his first two years in office. The military had actually drafted plans for a takeover even before Fujimori's inauguration, under a scheme called Plan Verde—Green Plan. According to a contemporary news magazine report, one scenario in the plan was titled "Negotiation and agreement with Fujimori. Bases of negotiation: concept of directed Democracy and Market Economy." The military intended to present Fujimori with their terms at least twenty-four hours before he took office.</p>

<p>The key figure connecting Fujimori to the military was Vladimiro Montesinos, a lawyer and former army captain with a shadowy past. Montesinos had reportedly been charged with spying on the Peruvian military for the United States Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA—an allegation that, if true, would explain why the American government was reportedly supportive of Fujimori's candidacy. According to the U.S. ambassador, documents suggesting CIA support for Fujimori were authentic.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1992, Fujimori made his move. With military support, he shut down Congress, suspended the constitution, and dissolved the judiciary. It was what political scientists call an "autogolpe"—a self-coup, in which an elected leader uses unconstitutional means to seize additional power. Fujimori had effectively made himself dictator of Peru.</p>

<p>His approval rating soared.</p>

<p>Fujimori defended his actions by arguing that Peruvian democracy had been nothing more than "a deceptive formality—a façade." The coup, he claimed, was "not a negation of real democracy, but on the contrary... a search for an authentic transformation to assure a legitimate and effective democracy." It was the language of populist authoritarianism: the elected legislature was illegitimate, so destroying it actually strengthened democracy.</p>

<h2>International Isolation, Domestic Popularity</h2>

<p>The international community reacted with near-unanimous condemnation. The Organization of American States, or OAS—the regional body that includes most countries in the Western Hemisphere—denounced the coup and demanded a return to "representative democracy." Venezuela severed diplomatic relations entirely. Argentina withdrew its ambassador. Chile joined the chorus of criticism.</p>

<p>Fujimori initially proposed holding a referendum to ratify his coup, but the OAS rejected this idea. Eventually, he agreed to hold elections for a "Democratic Constituent Congress" that would draft a new constitution. These elections took place in November 1992, and the resulting constitution was approved by referendum the following year. Fujimori was then elected to a second term in 1995.</p>

<p>But the new constitutional order was designed to serve his interests. With Congress dissolved and the judiciary under his control, Fujimori faced no meaningful checks on his power. Vladimiro Montesinos, his shadowy intelligence chief, assumed what observers described as "the actual function of Peru's government." The National Intelligence Service, known by its Spanish acronym SIN, placed its operatives in military leadership roles throughout the armed forces.</p>

<p>What followed was a decade of authoritarian rule characterized by propaganda, corruption, extrajudicial killings, and systematic human rights violations.</p>

<h2>The Dark Side of Order</h2>

<p>Fujimori's government did achieve its stated objective of defeating the Shining Path. The guerrilla movement's leader, Abimael Guzmán, was captured in 1992, and the organization never recovered. For many Peruvians who had lived in terror of Shining Path violence, this was what mattered most. They were willing to overlook a great deal in exchange for safety.</p>

<p>But the methods employed were horrifying.</p>

<p>Under Plan Verde, the military conducted operations that resulted in multiple cases of extrajudicial killings—murders carried out by state forces without any legal process. The targets were often suspected Shining Path members or sympathizers, but the definition of "sympathizer" could be dangerously broad.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most disturbing element of Fujimori's rule was a forced sterilization program targeting Peru's indigenous population. Under the provisions of Plan Verde, indigenous women were subjected to sterilization procedures without their meaningful consent. The program was framed as a public health initiative, but its actual effect was to prevent indigenous Peruvians from having children. Estimates of the number of victims range into the hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, corruption flourished. Montesinos, who operated largely in the shadows, amassed a fortune through bribery and kickbacks. He maintained his power through an extensive network of informants and by secretly recording conversations with politicians, businessmen, and military officers—creating blackmail material that made him almost untouchable.</p>

<h2>A Third Term Too Many</h2>

<p>In 2000, Fujimori ran for a third term. This was controversial on its face—the constitution he himself had drafted limited presidents to two consecutive terms. Fujimori's supporters argued that his first term didn't count because it had occurred under the previous constitution, a bit of legal sophistry that convinced few outside his inner circle.</p>

<p>The election was marred by allegations of fraud. International observers expressed serious concerns about the integrity of the vote. But Fujimori claimed victory nonetheless.</p>

<p>Then the system began to collapse.</p>

<p>Videos emerged showing Montesinos bribing a congressman. The scandal was devastating—concrete evidence of the corruption that critics had long alleged. Fujimori initially tried to distance himself from his intelligence chief, but the revelations kept coming. More videos surfaced. More officials were implicated. The entire edifice of the Fujimori regime began to crumble.</p>

<p>Facing mounting allegations of corruption and crimes against humanity, Fujimori made a decision that would define the final chapter of his presidency. He fled to Japan.</p>

<h2>Exile and Extradition</h2>

<p>From Tokyo, Fujimori faxed his resignation to the Peruvian Congress. It was an ignominious end to a decade in power—a president of a major nation quitting by fax from exile in a foreign country.</p>

<p>But Congress refused to accept his resignation on those terms. Instead, legislators voted to remove him from office on the grounds that he was "permanently morally disabled"—an unusual constitutional provision, but one that allowed Peru to formally end his presidency while also branding him as unfit for the office he had held.</p>

<p>Peru issued multiple criminal charges against its former president and requested his extradition from Japan. The Japanese government refused. Fujimori, it turned out, was a Japanese citizen—his parents had registered his birth at the Japanese Embassy in Lima, making him eligible for citizenship under Japanese law. And Japan does not extradite its own citizens.</p>

<p>This raised awkward questions about Fujimori's eligibility to have been president in the first place. The Peruvian constitution requires that the president be born in Peru. In 1997, a Peruvian magazine called Caretas had alleged that Fujimori was actually born in Japan, in his father's hometown, and that his birth and baptismal certificates had been altered. The magazine claimed that Fujimori's mother had declared having two children when she entered Peru, and that Alberto was one of them. If true, this would have made his entire presidency constitutionally illegitimate.</p>

<p>The allegations were hotly contested. Another magazine called Sí described them as "pathetic" and "a dark page for Peruvian journalism." The issue seemed to die down after the Japanese government confirmed that Fujimori's parents had registered his birth at the embassy in Lima—though this statement was somewhat ambiguous about where the birth actually occurred.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth about his birthplace, Fujimori was safe in Japan. He remained there for five years.</p>

<h2>The Trap</h2>

<p>In 2005, Fujimori made a fateful miscalculation. He traveled to Santiago, Chile, apparently believing he could use the country as a base for a political comeback in Peru. Perhaps he thought Chile would be more sympathetic, or that he could slip back into Peruvian politics from a neighboring country.</p>

<p>Instead, the Carabineros de Chile—the Chilean national police—arrested him at Peru's request. After two years of legal proceedings, Chile extradited Fujimori to Lima to face charges.</p>

<p>The trial that followed was a landmark moment for international human rights law. Fujimori was convicted of authorizing death squad killings and kidnappings. He was sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. It was one of the first times that a democratically elected leader had been successfully prosecuted in his own country for human rights violations committed while in office.</p>

<h2>The Final Chapter</h2>

<p>Prison did not quite stick.</p>

<p>In 2017, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who was then president of Peru, granted Fujimori a pardon. The decision was immediately controversial—Kuczynski was facing his own political difficulties, and critics alleged that the pardon was part of a political deal. Legal challenges to the pardon wound through the courts for years.</p>

<p>Fujimori was finally released in December 2023, after what had been a prolonged legal battle over whether the pardon was valid. He was eighty-five years old and in poor health.</p>

<p>He lived for nine more months. Alberto Fujimori died on September 11, 2024, a free man despite his convictions for human rights abuses.</p>

<h2>The Legacy of Fujimorism</h2>

<p>Fujimori's political legacy did not die with him, or even with his imprisonment. His daughter Keiko Fujimori has run for president of Peru three times, losing narrowly each time. The political movement he created—sometimes called Fujimorism—remains a significant force in Peruvian politics, combining free-market economics with social conservatism and a willingness to embrace authoritarian methods in the name of order and stability.</p>

<p>This is what makes the story of Alberto Fujimori more than just a historical curiosity. He represents a template that has been repeated across Latin America and around the world: the outsider candidate who wins on promises of change, then consolidates power by attacking democratic institutions, all while maintaining genuine popular support.</p>

<p>The Peruvian public did not cheer Fujimori's self-coup because they had been deceived. Many of them cheered because they believed—perhaps correctly—that the institutions being destroyed had failed them. The question that haunted Peru then, and haunts democracies everywhere now, is what happens when people conclude that the cure for bad governance is no governance at all.</p>

<p>Fujimori's answer was himself: a strong leader unencumbered by legislators, judges, or constitutional limits. For a time, it seemed to work. The economy stabilized. The Shining Path was defeated. The chaos receded.</p>

<p>But the price was paid in forced sterilizations, in extrajudicial killings, in corruption that reached into every corner of public life, and in the precedent that democracy could be discarded whenever it became inconvenient. That price is still being paid today.</p>
