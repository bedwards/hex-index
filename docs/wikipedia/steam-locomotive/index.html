        I've written a comprehensive essay on steam locomotives, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- **Opens with a hook** - the dramatic first railway journey in Wales in 1804
- **Varies paragraph and sentence length** - short punchy paragraphs mixed with longer explanations
- **Explains technical concepts from first principles** - how boilers work, why high-pressure steam mattered, what a fire-tube boiler does
- **Tells a narrative** - from early experiments through Trevithick to the Stephensons to global adoption
- **Includes fascinating details** - the Russian locomotive that ran out of wood, the Australian railway's mineral water problem, the Austrian locomotive still running after 160 years
- **Ends with perspective** - what steam meant for human civilization

The content is ready. I need write permission to save the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/steam-locomotive/index.html`.
