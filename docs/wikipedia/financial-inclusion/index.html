        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on Financial Inclusion. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what the output contains:

**Opening Hook**: Starts with the striking statistic that 1.4 billion adults lack bank accounts—immediately engaging rather than leading with a dry definition.

**Key Sections**:
- More Than Just a Bank Account - explains the concept goes beyond opening accounts, contrasts with payday loans as the opposite of inclusion
- Why It Matters for Everyone - economic arguments for inclusive financial systems
- The Barriers: Supply and Demand - explains both institutional and individual obstacles
- The India Experiment - detailed case study of India's 70+ year effort
- The Philippines: Credit as a Keycard - contrasting approach focused on credit scoring
- Technology as Accelerant - fintech, mobile banking, biometrics, electronic benefits
- The Skeptics - critiques of microfinance and measurement problems
- Education and the Demand Side - financial literacy efforts
- A Global Priority - UN involvement and international coordination
- The Road Ahead - concluding thoughts connecting back to the related Substack article

**Writing Style**: Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm, spells out acronyms, explains concepts from first principles, and maintains narrative flow throughout. The closing paragraph ties back to "yellow cards" from the related Substack article about Will Bank in Brazil.

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/financial-inclusion/index.html` once you grant write permission.
