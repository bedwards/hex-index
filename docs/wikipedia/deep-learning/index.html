        I've written a comprehensive essay on deep learning, transformed from the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a hook about the 1993 neural history compressor solving a 1000+ step problem
- Explains "deep" learning through the intuitive example of face recognition layers
- Covers the historical arc from Rosenblatt (1958) through modern transformers
- Explains key concepts like backpropagation, vanishing gradients, and LSTMs without jargon
- Discusses GANs, transformers, and the modern deep learning revolution
- Addresses what deep learning is NOT (not a brain model)
- Ends with philosophical reflection on the gap between capability and understanding

The piece is approximately 3,000 words (~15 minutes reading time), uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good audio flow, and builds understanding from first principles without assuming prior knowledge.
