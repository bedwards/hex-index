<h2>The City That Changed Hands Five Times</h2>

<p>At the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, where the Gulf of Aqaba meets the Red Sea, sits a city that has been conquered, returned, occupied, traded, and transformed more times than most places experience in centuries. Sharm El Sheikh—often shortened simply to "Sharm" by Egyptians and visitors alike—began as a humble fishing village. Today it welcomes over ten million visitors annually, hosts international peace summits, and stands as one of the world's premier diving destinations.</p>

<p>But the path from fishing nets to five-star resorts runs through decades of war, occupation, and some of the most contentious geopolitics of the modern era.</p>

<h2>A Strategic Prize Worth Fighting Over</h2>

<p>The geography tells you everything. Sharm El Sheikh sits on a promontory overlooking the Straits of Tiran, a narrow passage that controls access to the entire Gulf of Aqaba. Any nation controlling this spot effectively holds the keys to the Israeli port of Eilat and the Jordanian port of Aqaba. In an era of container ships and global trade, that might seem like a minor consideration. In the mid-twentieth century, it was worth going to war over.</p>

<p>Israel seized Sharm during the Suez Crisis of 1956. The Suez Crisis itself is worth understanding: it was the moment when the old European colonial powers—Britain and France—attempted one last imperial adventure, conspiring with Israel to seize the Suez Canal after Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized it. The scheme collapsed under American and Soviet pressure, and Israel returned Sharm to Egypt in 1957.</p>

<p>A United Nations peacekeeping force then stationed itself in Sharm El Sheikh. For a decade, blue-helmeted soldiers kept watch over these strategic waters. Then, in May 1967, Nasser demanded the peacekeepers leave. They did.</p>

<p>Within weeks, the Six-Day War erupted. Israel captured not just Sharm but the entire Sinai Peninsula, along with the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. The fishing village would remain under Israeli control for the next fifteen years.</p>

<h2>Ofira: The Settlement That Survived</h2>

<p>During the Israeli occupation, a settlement called Ofira grew up in the Sharm area. This matters because of what happened later—or rather, what didn't happen.</p>

<p>When Egypt and Israel signed their historic peace treaty in 1979, brokered by American President Jimmy Carter at Camp David, Israel agreed to return the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. The handover took place in 1982. In the northern Sinai, at a settlement called Yamit, Israeli soldiers had to forcibly remove their own citizens, and the buildings were demolished to prevent any symbolic return.</p>

<p>Ofira was different. The settlement was handed over intact. Those same buildings, that same infrastructure, became the foundation of modern Sharm El Sheikh. Israeli vacation bungalows became Egyptian hotel properties. The military airfield that Israel had operated since 1968 became the site of Sharm El Sheikh International Airport, eventually receiving a four-hundred-twenty-million-dollar investment to transform it into a gateway capable of handling millions of tourists.</p>

<p>It's a strange footnote to history: one of Egypt's most successful tourist cities was built, quite literally, on Israeli construction.</p>

<h2>From Conflict Zone to City of Peace</h2>

<p>Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak saw opportunity in this former flashpoint. In 1982, the same year Egypt regained control, he designated Sharm El Sheikh as the "City of Peace"—a name that reflected both aspiration and marketing savvy.</p>

<p>The peace conferences began flowing in. In September 1999, Israeli and Palestinian leaders met in Sharm to negotiate Palestinian self-rule over the Gaza Strip. When the second Palestinian intifada—the Arabic word for "uprising"—broke out in 2000, world leaders gathered again in Sharm, though that summit failed to halt the violence. Arab League meetings, World Bank conferences, Iraqi reconstruction discussions—Sharm became neutral ground for some of the region's most contentious negotiations.</p>

<p>The World Economic Forum brought its annual Middle East gathering to Sharm in 2006 and 2008. In November 2022, the city hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP27, which produced the first international agreement on a "loss and damage fund"—essentially, a mechanism for wealthy nations to compensate poorer nations for climate-related disasters.</p>

<p>Most recently, in October 2025, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and American President Donald Trump co-hosted a summit aimed at ending the war in Gaza, bringing together leaders from more than twenty nations.</p>

<p>The nickname stuck. Whether the summits actually produce peace is another matter. But the conferences keep coming.</p>

<h2>The Resort Boom</h2>

<p>While diplomats negotiated, developers built. The numbers tell a remarkable story of transformation.</p>

<p>In 1982, when Egypt regained Sharm, there were exactly three resorts. By 2000, there were ninety-one. Guest nights—the hospitality industry's measure of rooms occupied—exploded from sixteen thousand to five point one million over that same period.</p>

<p>What drove this explosive growth? Several factors converged.</p>

<p>First, geography again. Sharm sits close enough to Europe—about a four-hour flight from London or Berlin—to serve as a winter sun destination for tourists escaping gray northern skies. The Red Sea waters remain swimmable year-round, ranging from twenty-one degrees Celsius in winter to twenty-eight in summer. (That's seventy to eighty-two degrees Fahrenheit for American readers.)</p>

<p>Second, the marine environment is genuinely spectacular. The reefs around Sharm host an estimated two hundred fifty different coral species and a thousand species of fish. For recreational scuba divers—a growing market in the late twentieth century—this made Sharm a world-class destination.</p>

<p>Third, Egyptian environmental regulations actually helped. Zoning laws limit building heights to preserve sight lines to the mountains and sea. This prevented the kind of concrete-wall-of-hotels development that blights some Mediterranean resorts, keeping Sharm visually appealing.</p>

<p>Today, the city hosts properties from nearly every major international hotel chain. Accor operates under its Mövenpick, Novotel, and Rixos brands. Deutsche Hospitality runs Steigenberger properties. Four Seasons, Hilton, Marriott, and Rotana all have substantial presences. In 2022, TripAdvisor ranked Sharm El Sheikh and its sister resort city Hurghada among the world's top twenty-five tourist destinations.</p>

<h2>Terror in Paradise</h2>

<p>The boom was not uninterrupted.</p>

<p>On July 23, 2005, a coordinated series of bomb attacks struck Sharm El Sheikh. An extremist Islamist organization targeted the tourist infrastructure that had become so central to Egypt's economy. The attacks killed eighty-eight people—most of them Egyptian workers rather than foreign tourists—and wounded over two hundred.</p>

<p>It remains the second deadliest terrorist attack in Egyptian history.</p>

<p>The tourism industry suffered but recovered. Security measures intensified. The resorts kept building. The conferences kept coming. By the metrics that tourism officials track, Sharm has largely moved past that terrible day, though the families of the victims certainly have not.</p>

<h2>What the Desert and Sea Provide</h2>

<p>The landscape around Sharm offers more than beaches and coral reefs, though those remain the primary attractions.</p>

<p>Ras Muhammad National Park occupies the southernmost tip of the Sinai Peninsula, where the waters of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez meet. It's a protected area encompassing marine and terrestrial environments—coral reefs, mangroves, and desert wildlife. For divers, the underwater cliff faces and abundant marine life make it one of the world's most renowned dive sites.</p>

<p>North of the city, the Nabq Managed Resource Protected Area covers six hundred square kilometers of remarkably diverse terrain. Mangrove forests—unusual this far north—give way to coral reefs, fertile sand dunes, and desert valleys. Gazelles, Nubian camels (a particularly hardy desert-adapted breed), ibex, foxes, and hyraxes all inhabit the area. (Hyraxes, if you've never encountered them, are small furry mammals that look like oversized guinea pigs but are, bizarrely, the closest living relatives of elephants.)</p>

<p>Bedouin tribes still live in the Nabq region, maintaining traditional ways of life that have adapted to accommodate tourism. Handicraft stands selling Bedouin wares remain a popular attraction throughout the area.</p>

<h2>The Climate of Extremes</h2>

<p>Sharm's climate is classified as a subtropical hot desert—the same category as Las Vegas or Dubai. Summers are genuinely fierce, with temperatures routinely reaching thirty-three to thirty-seven degrees Celsius (ninety-one to ninety-nine Fahrenheit). The hottest temperature ever recorded in Sharm hit forty-six Celsius—one hundred fifteen Fahrenheit—in June 2013.</p>

<p>Winters, by contrast, are remarkably pleasant, with temperatures ranging from eighteen to twenty-three Celsius (sixty-four to seventy-three Fahrenheit). This is why European tour operators love Sharm: it offers reliable warm-weather escapes precisely when Northern Europe is at its grayest and coldest.</p>

<p>Rain is essentially irrelevant. The city receives almost none. Fresh water comes from desalination plants that process Red Sea water—a technology that has become increasingly sophisticated and forms a major part of the city's infrastructure.</p>

<h2>The Green Transformation</h2>

<p>In recent years, Sharm has become a laboratory for sustainable tourism development—a somewhat ironic designation for a desert city that exists primarily because tourists fly thousands of kilometers to lie on its beaches.</p>

<p>The sustainability push is real nonetheless. Solar energy projects now provide fifty-one megawatts of clean power. Hotels have installed rooftop solar panels. Electric buses have begun replacing diesel vehicles on some routes. The city has built one hundred forty-five kilometers of dedicated cycling lanes, an ambitious number for a place where summer temperatures make outdoor exercise genuinely dangerous for much of the year.</p>

<p>The United Nations Development Programme and Egypt's Ministry of Environment have partnered on what they call the "Green Sharm" platform, focused on water conservation, biodiversity protection, and coral reef preservation. The city is working to eliminate single-use plastic bags—a meaningful step given how much plastic waste typically accumulates in tourist destinations.</p>

<p>Whether these initiatives represent genuine environmental commitment or "greenwashing" for marketing purposes is a fair question. The answer is probably both. Tourism-dependent economies have strong incentives to protect the natural attractions that draw visitors. Dead coral reefs and polluted beaches would destroy Sharm's appeal far more effectively than any competitor destination could.</p>

<h2>How a City Gets Organized</h2>

<p>Understanding Sharm's geography helps make sense of the city. It's divided into eight administrative centers, each with a distinct character.</p>

<p>Naama Bay is the tourist heart—the highest concentration of hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, and international visitors. If you've seen a photograph of Sharm's beachfront, it was probably taken here.</p>

<p>The Old Market area offers a more traditionally Egyptian experience, with souks (the Arabic word for markets) selling spices, textiles, and handicrafts alongside tourist souvenirs.</p>

<p>Hadaba, also called Ras Umm Sid, sits on a headland with panoramic views. It's where some of the city's best diving sites are accessible directly from shore.</p>

<p>Shark's Bay—despite its ominous name—is actually known for calm waters and family-friendly beaches. The sharks that gave it its name are reef sharks, generally harmless to humans unless provoked.</p>

<p>Together with areas called Hay el Nour, Rowaysat, and Montazah, these centers form a metropolitan area that stretches along the coast and houses a permanent population of approximately seventy-seven thousand people—a number that swells dramatically during peak tourist seasons.</p>

<h2>The Entertainment Economy</h2>

<p>A resort city needs more than beaches and coral reefs. Sharm has developed a robust entertainment infrastructure to keep tourists spending money after the sun goes down.</p>

<p>Several casinos operate in the Naama Bay area, including the Sinai Grand Casino, Casino Royale, and Aladin Casino. Gambling is prohibited for Egyptian citizens under Islamic law, but tourists face no such restrictions—a common arrangement throughout the Muslim world, where the economic benefits of casino tourism are deemed to outweigh religious objections as long as locals aren't participating.</p>

<p>The nightlife scene centers on Naama Bay and a development called SOHO Square, which hosts live bands, DJs, and themed club nights. Electronic music festivals have become increasingly significant, with events like Zamna Sharm and the Sandbox Festival drawing international audiences—though the latter typically takes place in El Gouna, a resort area further north along the Red Sea coast.</p>

<p>For those preferring daylight adventures, safari tourism has grown substantially. Tours typically involve quad bikes, dune buggies, or camel rides into the Sinai interior, often concluding at traditional Bedouin camps where tourists experience (a carefully curated version of) desert nomad life.</p>

<h2>Getting There and Getting In</h2>

<p>Sharm El Sheikh International Airport handles the vast majority of tourist arrivals. The facility has undergone massive upgrades, with a new terminal designed to process ten million passengers annually—a number that reflects just how central tourism has become to Egypt's economy.</p>

<p>For visitors from the European Union or the United States, Sharm offers an unusual visa arrangement. If you're staying in the South Sinai area for fourteen days or less and don't plan to travel elsewhere in Egypt, no visa is required. This "Sinai-only" stamp makes Sharm exceptionally easy to visit for quick beach holidays.</p>

<p>However—and this catches some tourists off guard—if you want to visit the Pyramids at Giza or take a Nile cruise or do essentially anything outside the Sinai Peninsula, you'll need a full Egyptian visa. These are available for a modest fee upon arrival at any Egyptian airport, but the distinction matters for trip planning.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>Sharm El Sheikh's transformation from contested military outpost to international resort destination mirrors broader shifts in the Middle East. The Egypt-Israel peace treaty that enabled Sharm's development was the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab state—a diplomatic breakthrough that seemed impossible just years earlier and that has now endured for over four decades despite regional upheavals.</p>

<p>The city embodies a certain vision of Middle Eastern development: tourism as economic engine, environmental protection as brand differentiation, international conferences as diplomatic infrastructure. Whether this model is sustainable—in the environmental sense, in the economic sense, in the political sense—remains an open question.</p>

<p>What's clear is that Sharm has survived occupation, transition, terrorism, revolution, and pandemic. When Hosni Mubarak was driven from power during the 2011 Egyptian protests, he reportedly fled to Sharm El Sheikh before resigning the presidency. The city he had championed as the "City of Peace" became his final refuge as a ruler.</p>

<p>He died there in 2020, a decade after his fall. The resorts kept operating through it all. The divers kept descending to the reefs. The conferences kept convening. Whatever else Sharm El Sheikh has become, it has proven remarkably resilient—a city built on strategic geography, rebuilt on tourism economics, and sustained by the simple fact that its coral reefs and warm waters offer something that cold northern climates cannot.</p>

<p>Ten million visitors a year suggest the model is working, at least for now.</p>
