        I've written the complete triode essay. The article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that starts with a hook about Lee de Forest accidentally creating the entire field of electronics in 1906.

The essay covers:
- The accidental discovery of amplification
- How triodes work (thermionic emission, electron control)
- The birth of radio broadcasting
- Transcontinental telephone service
- Physical construction details
- High-power and high-frequency variants
- The transistor's arrival and displacement of tubes
- The triode's continuing life in transmitters and audiophile equipment
- Vacuum fluorescent displays as humble descendants
- The lasting legacy of the technology

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for good audio flow, explains technical concepts from first principles, and maintains narrative momentum throughout. It's approximately 3,000 words, suitable for about 15-20 minutes of Speechify reading.
