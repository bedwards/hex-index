        The Write tool needs permission to create this new file. Once you grant permission, it will write the rewritten Third Way article as an HTML file following the same format as other Wikipedia deep dives in the project.

The article I've prepared:
- Opens with Tony Blair's 1997 landslide as a hook rather than a dry definition
- Traces the intellectual origins through the postwar consensus, stagflation crisis, and Thatcher/Reagan revolution
- Explains the core philosophy of "rights with responsibilities" with concrete examples like Clinton's welfare reform
- Covers global implementations in Australia (Hawke/Keating), Germany (Schröder's Agenda 2010), France (Macron), and Brazil
- Presents critiques from both left (democratic socialists calling it "Thatcherism with a human face") and right (libertarians seeing it as inconsistent compromise)
- Explores the strange prehistory of the term in German ordoliberalism, Prague Spring, and Italian Eurocommunism
- Ends with reflection on what remains of Third Way thinking today
