<h2>The Company That Charges 9,400% Markups on Metal Pins</h2>

<p>In 2019, Pentagon auditors discovered something remarkable. A small metal pin that TransDigm Group sold to the Department of Defense carried a markup of nine thousand four hundred percent. Not nine hundred. Not ninety-four hundred. Nine thousand four hundred percent.</p>

<p>This wasn't a mistake. It wasn't fraud, exactly. It was a business model.</p>

<p>TransDigm Group, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, has built itself into one of the most profitable aerospace companies in America by pursuing a strategy that sounds almost comically simple: buy companies that make airplane parts nobody else makes, then charge whatever you want for those parts.</p>

<p>The strategy has made TransDigm enormously successful. It has also made the company enormously controversial, dragging its executives before Congress repeatedly to explain why they're charging the military and commercial airlines prices that seem disconnected from any reasonable notion of cost.</p>

<h2>How a Private Equity Play Became an Aerospace Giant</h2>

<p>TransDigm didn't start as a vision to dominate aerospace components. It started, like so many modern business stories, with private equity.</p>

<p>In 1993, a private equity firm called Kelso and Company partnered with two industry veterans, W. Nicholas Howley and Douglas Peacock, to execute what's known as a leveraged buyout. A leveraged buyout works like this: investors put up a relatively small amount of their own money, borrow a much larger amount, use that combined capital to buy a company, then use the purchased company's own cash flow to pay back the debt. It's essentially buying a business with that business's own future earnings.</p>

<p>The initial equity investment was just ten million dollars. With that seed money plus borrowed funds, the newly formed TD Holding Corporation acquired four industrial aerospace companies from a conglomerate called IMO Industries. These weren't glamorous businesses. They made fasteners, connectors, pumps, and various control mechanisms. The kinds of components most people never think about but that airplanes absolutely cannot fly without.</p>

<p>The four companies were Adel Fasteners, Aero Products Component Services, Controlex Corporation, and Wiggins Connectors. Once assembled under one roof in Richmond Heights, Ohio, the combined entity was renamed TransDigm, Incorporated.</p>

<h2>The Acquisition Machine Turns On</h2>

<p>What happened next established the pattern that would define TransDigm for the next three decades.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to organically grow the business by developing new products or expanding into new markets, TransDigm's strategy was acquisitive. Find other companies making aerospace components. Buy them. Integrate them. Repeat.</p>

<p>From 1993 to 1998, revenues grew by approximately twenty-five percent per year. This wasn't because the aerospace market was booming. It was because TransDigm kept buying competitors and absorbing their revenue streams.</p>

<p>In 1998, the company changed hands for the first time. A different private equity firm, Odyssey Investment Partners, bought TransDigm from Kelso and Company. The new owners kept the same strategy running.</p>

<p>Then came September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>The terrorist attacks devastated the entire aerospace industry. Air travel collapsed. Airlines canceled orders. Defense budgets shifted to ground wars. TransDigm, like everyone in the sector, experienced losses and layoffs.</p>

<p>But the company survived, and by 2002 it had recovered to three hundred million dollars in annual revenues, more than double what it had generated just three years earlier in 1999. The acquisition machine, it seemed, could power through even an industry-wide catastrophe.</p>

<h2>Private Equity's Revolving Door</h2>

<p>In 2003, TransDigm changed private equity hands again. Warburg Pincus, one of the largest and oldest private equity firms in the world, acquired the company from Odyssey Investment Partners for 1.1 billion dollars.</p>

<p>Consider that trajectory. A company assembled for roughly ten million dollars in equity in 1993 sold for over a billion dollars a decade later. The leveraged buyout model had worked exactly as designed, multiplying the original investors' returns many times over.</p>

<p>Three years later, in 2006, TransDigm went public. An initial public offering, commonly abbreviated IPO, is when a privately held company first sells shares to the general public on a stock exchange. TransDigm listed on the New York Stock Exchange, finally giving outside investors a chance to participate in the company's growth.</p>

<p>By 2007, annual revenues had climbed to five hundred ninety-three million dollars.</p>

<h2>Sixty Acquisitions in Twenty-Five Years</h2>

<p>Going public did nothing to slow TransDigm's appetite for deals. If anything, having access to public capital markets accelerated it.</p>

<p>In its first twenty-five years of existence, TransDigm acquired more than sixty businesses. Forty-nine of those deals closed after the 2006 IPO. That's roughly three acquisitions per year, year after year, for nearly two decades.</p>

<p>Some of these deals were modest. Others were transformative.</p>

<p>In 2010, TransDigm bought McKechnie Aerospace Holdings, a competing aftermarket parts company, for 1.27 billion dollars. The aftermarket business is particularly lucrative in aerospace. When an airline needs a replacement part for an aging aircraft, they often have no choice but to buy from whoever makes that specific component. Unlike buying a new car where you might choose between dozens of manufacturers, a twenty-year-old Boeing 737 needs specific parts that specific companies produce.</p>

<p>In 2016, the company acquired Data Device Corporation, which makes power systems, networking equipment, and electronics, for one billion dollars.</p>

<p>Then came the big one.</p>

<p>In 2018, TransDigm announced it would acquire Esterline, a competing aerospace parts manufacturer, for four billion dollars. This was the largest acquisition in the company's history, roughly quadrupling the size of the McKechnie deal from eight years earlier.</p>

<p>The deals kept coming. In 2022, TransDigm bought DART Aerospace, a Canadian company specializing in helicopter equipment, for three hundred sixty million dollars. In 2023, it acquired Calspan, an aviation research company, for seven hundred twenty-five million, followed by the Electron Device Business from Communications and Power Industries for 1.39 billion dollars.</p>

<h2>What TransDigm Actually Makes</h2>

<p>All of this financial engineering exists to support a business that makes things. Physical objects. Components that go into aircraft and keep them flying.</p>

<p>TransDigm's product portfolio falls into three main categories.</p>

<p>The largest segment is power and control products. This includes pumps that move hydraulic fluid, valves that control fuel flow, and ignition systems that start jet engines. These components account for roughly half of the company's revenue.</p>

<p>The second major segment is airframe products. These are the structural and mechanical components that make up the body of an aircraft: latching and locking devices, cockpit security components, and audio systems. This segment accounts for most of the remaining revenue.</p>

<p>A smaller third segment covers non-aviation products, including restraint systems, space systems, and parts for heavy industrial equipment.</p>

<p>Here's what makes TransDigm's business model distinctive. Most of the aerospace parts the company sells are proprietary products. TransDigm is often the only manufacturer in the world that currently produces a given component. If an airline needs that part, they have exactly one place to buy it.</p>

<h2>The Monopoly Question</h2>

<p>Being the sole supplier of a product isn't automatically problematic. Many companies hold patents or possess specialized expertise that makes them unique. The question is what a company does with that position.</p>

<p>TransDigm's critics argue the company uses its monopoly positions aggressively, charging prices far above what the actual manufacturing costs would justify.</p>

<p>The 2019 Pentagon audit put numbers to this concern. Beyond the infamous 9,400% markup on a metal pin, the broader review found a pattern of what auditors considered excessive pricing across TransDigm's government contracts.</p>

<p>After a congressional hearing criticized the company's practices, TransDigm agreed to refund the Pentagon sixteen million dollars. But the controversy didn't end there.</p>

<p>In 2022, founder Nick Howley was called back to testify before Congress on accusations of price gouging. A Department of Defense review alleged the company had charged one hundred nineteen million dollars for parts that should have cost twenty-eight million. A 2021 report had already alleged TransDigm made excess profits of 20.8 million dollars on just one hundred five spare parts across one hundred fifty contracts.</p>

<h2>The Company's Defense</h2>

<p>TransDigm has consistently defended its pricing practices, though the defense is more nuanced than critics often acknowledge.</p>

<p>The company argues that maintaining manufacturing capability for older aerospace components is expensive in ways that simple per-unit cost calculations miss. An aircraft might stay in service for thirty or forty years. Throughout that lifespan, it needs replacement parts. But nobody is manufacturing hundreds of thousands of those parts at a time. They're being made in small batches on specialized equipment that must be kept operational for decades.</p>

<p>As explained by defenders of the company's approach, older aerospace components aren't expensive to produce individually in terms of raw materials and labor. What's expensive is keeping dated manufacturing lines active, maintaining quality certifications, retaining institutional knowledge about how to make parts designed decades ago, and being ready to produce small quantities on demand.</p>

<p>TransDigm also argues its pricing reflects the absolute necessity of quality and reliability in aerospace. A failure in the parts TransDigm makes doesn't result in a customer service complaint. It can result in a plane falling out of the sky. The company claims its profits fund the rigorous quality control and engineering investment needed to ensure parts always work as specified.</p>

<h2>Airlines Caught in the Middle</h2>

<p>The pricing controversy extends beyond government contracts into commercial aviation.</p>

<p>A former employee of AvtechTyee, a company later acquired by TransDigm, described the dynamic bluntly: airlines are stuck with TransDigm's parts. Refusing to use the company's components means your planes don't fly.</p>

<p>Abdol Moabery, chief executive officer of GA Telesis, an aircraft maintenance company, echoed this assessment. He noted that TransDigm's pricing practices have made it significantly more expensive for airlines to repair their aircraft.</p>

<p>Even aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus find themselves caught in the middle. When TransDigm acquires a company that Boeing contracted with to make certain parts, Boeing suddenly finds itself dependent on a new supplier with different pricing philosophies. The original contract might have had certain terms, but as components wear out and need replacement, the aftermarket pricing is whatever TransDigm decides to charge.</p>

<h2>The Financial Results</h2>

<p>Whatever one thinks of the ethics, the financial results have been extraordinary.</p>

<p>From TransDigm's IPO in 2006 to 2020, revenues grew fifteen-fold. Fifteen times larger in fourteen years. That kind of growth in a mature industry like aerospace manufacturing is almost unheard of.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 finally slowed the company down. With air travel collapsing worldwide, demand for aerospace components dropped sharply. But even this proved to be a temporary setback. As air travel recovered, so did TransDigm's business.</p>

<h2>A Case Study in Modern Capitalism</h2>

<p>TransDigm represents something larger than just one company's business strategy. It's a case study in how private equity and public markets can combine to create dominant positions in fragmented industries.</p>

<p>The aerospace components industry was once made up of many small, independent manufacturers. Each had their specialties, their customer relationships, their particular expertise. TransDigm's serial acquisition strategy consolidated much of this fragmented landscape under one corporate umbrella.</p>

<p>This consolidation created efficiencies. One company can manage shared services like accounting and legal more cheaply than dozens of small companies can. But it also created pricing power. When you're the only manufacturer of a part an airline desperately needs, negotiations look very different than when multiple suppliers compete for the business.</p>

<p>The debate over whether this represents efficient capitalism or exploitative monopoly depends largely on one's broader economic philosophy. Free market advocates might argue that if TransDigm's prices were truly unjustified, competitors would emerge to undercut them. Critics counter that the barriers to entry in aerospace manufacturing, including certification requirements, specialized expertise, and the need to maintain production capability for decades, make meaningful competition nearly impossible.</p>

<h2>The Regulatory Challenge</h2>

<p>Government response to TransDigm's practices has been largely reactive. Congressional hearings generate headlines and occasional refunds, but haven't fundamentally changed the company's business model.</p>

<p>Part of the challenge is that TransDigm operates in a gray area. The company isn't doing anything obviously illegal. It's not fixing prices with competitors. It's not bribing officials. It's simply charging what the market will bear for products where it faces no competition.</p>

<p>Traditional antitrust law in the United States has focused primarily on preventing the creation of monopolies, not on regulating the behavior of companies that achieve dominant positions through legal means. TransDigm became the sole supplier of many parts by acquiring the companies that made them, transactions that were reviewed and approved by regulators at the time.</p>

<p>More aggressive antitrust enforcement could potentially block future acquisitions, preventing TransDigm from extending its dominance to new product categories. But it wouldn't unwind the consolidation that has already occurred.</p>

<h2>The Broader Question</h2>

<p>TransDigm forces us to confront an uncomfortable question about how markets work when certain goods are essential and alternatives don't exist.</p>

<p>We generally accept that prices should reflect supply and demand. If many people want something and few are selling it, prices rise. If sellers have abundant inventory and buyers are scarce, prices fall. This mechanism usually works well, encouraging production where demand exists and discouraging waste where it doesn't.</p>

<p>But aerospace parts aren't normal goods. An airline can't decide to skip maintenance because parts are expensive. The parts are required by safety regulations and by the basic physics of keeping aircraft airworthy. Demand is essentially inelastic, a term economists use to describe products people will buy regardless of price increases.</p>

<p>In markets with inelastic demand and sole suppliers, the normal checks on pricing don't function. TransDigm can raise prices, and customers must pay because their only alternative is grounding aircraft.</p>

<p>This dynamic exists throughout the economy in various forms. Pharmaceutical companies with patented drugs, utility companies with regional monopolies, technology platforms with network effects that make switching impractical. TransDigm is perhaps just more transparent about the dynamic than most.</p>

<h2>From Cleveland to Congress</h2>

<p>The story of TransDigm is ultimately a story about what happens when financial engineering meets physical engineering. Private equity investors saw an opportunity in fragmented aerospace manufacturing. They assembled a platform, bought competitors, and optimized for profitability.</p>

<p>Three decades later, that platform employs thousands of people and manufactures components that keep aircraft flying safely around the world. It has also generated billions in profits and sparked repeated government investigations into whether its pricing practices cross the line from aggressive to abusive.</p>

<p>The company that started with four fastener and connector manufacturers in Ohio now appears in congressional hearings about monopoly power and price gouging. Its founder has testified before lawmakers multiple times. Its pricing practices have become shorthand for the broader debate about corporate concentration in the American economy.</p>

<p>TransDigm isn't going away. Airlines will continue to need parts. Defense contractors will continue to buy components. The small metal pins that auditors found marked up by thousands of percent will continue to be manufactured and sold.</p>

<p>The only question is whether the rules governing companies like TransDigm will change, and whether American capitalism will continue to permit businesses built on the simple premise that if you're the only one selling what someone needs, you can charge whatever you want.</p>
