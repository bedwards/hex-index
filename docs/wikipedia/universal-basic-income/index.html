<h2>The Idea That Won't Die</h2>

<p>What if the government simply gave everyone money? No forms to fill out. No proof that you're looking for work. No humiliating interviews with caseworkers. Just cash, deposited into your account every month, whether you're a billionaire or broke.</p>

<p>This is universal basic income, and it's an idea that has captivated thinkers across the political spectrum for centuries. Conservatives like Milton Friedman have championed it. So have socialists like Bertrand Russell. Tech billionaires predict it's inevitable. Politicians on both the left and right have proposed versions of it. And yet, as of 2025, no country on Earth has fully implemented it.</p>

<p>Why does this seemingly simple idea keep resurfacing, generation after generation? And why, despite all that support, has no nation taken the plunge?</p>

<h2>What Universal Basic Income Actually Means</h2>

<p>Let's get precise about definitions, because the term "basic income" gets thrown around loosely.</p>

<p>Universal basic income has three defining features. First, it's universal—everyone gets it, rich and poor alike. Second, it's unconditional—you don't have to prove you need it or promise to do anything in return. Third, it's regular—not a one-time payment but an ongoing income stream.</p>

<p>This differs fundamentally from most welfare programs. Traditional welfare is means-tested, meaning you only qualify if you can prove you're poor enough. It's often conditional, requiring you to look for work or meet other criteria. And it typically phases out as your income rises, creating what economists call "poverty traps"—situations where earning an extra dollar of wages can actually leave you worse off because you lose more than a dollar in benefits.</p>

<p>Universal basic income sidesteps all of this. Everyone gets the same amount. Your check arrives whether you're unemployed, working part-time, running a startup, or sitting on a yacht.</p>

<p>Now, there's an important distinction within basic income proposals. A "full" basic income would be enough to live on—at or above the poverty line. A "partial" basic income would supplement your other income but not fully replace the need to work. Most real-world experiments have been partial, and the two countries that have come closest to implementing universal basic income—Mongolia and Iran—both tried partial versions.</p>

<h2>The Alaska Experiment</h2>

<p>There is one place where something like basic income has operated continuously for over four decades: Alaska.</p>

<p>In 1976, Alaskan voters approved a constitutional amendment creating the Alaska Permanent Fund. The state invests a portion of its oil revenue in this fund, and every year, every resident who has lived in Alaska for at least one year receives a dividend check. The amount fluctuates with investment returns and oil prices—in 2022, it hit a record $3,284, while in leaner years it's been closer to $1,000.</p>

<p>The Alaska dividend isn't quite a full basic income. The payments are too small to live on, and they come once a year rather than monthly. But it demonstrates something crucial: you can give everyone money with no strings attached, and society doesn't collapse.</p>

<p>Alaskans haven't stopped working. The state's economy functions normally. The main observable effects have been modest reductions in poverty, especially among rural and indigenous communities, and a slight increase in part-time work among mothers of young children. The feared mass exodus from the workforce simply hasn't happened.</p>

<h2>Ancient Roots</h2>

<p>The idea of the state providing for all citizens is far older than modern economics.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt maintained vast granaries that distributed food to the public during famines and hard times. This wasn't charity in the modern sense—it was a function of the state, operated by a unified theocratic government that controlled key parts of the economy.</p>

<p>Rome took this further. Julius Caesar, after his triumph in 46 BCE, gave every common Roman citizen one hundred denarii. When assassins killed him two years later, his will directed that three hundred sestertii—about seventy-five denarii—be distributed to each citizen. The Emperor Trajan, who ruled from 98 to 117 CE, personally gave 650 denarii to any common citizen who applied. In today's currency, that's roughly equivalent to $430.</p>

<p>These weren't exactly basic income—they were one-time distributions rather than regular payments—but they established a principle: the state has a role in ensuring citizens share in collective prosperity.</p>

<h2>Thomas More's Radical Proposal</h2>

<p>The first clear articulation of something like basic income came from an unlikely source: Thomas More, the English statesman who would eventually be executed by Henry VIII for refusing to endorse the king's divorce.</p>

<p>In his 1516 book "Utopia," More addressed a problem that remains with us five centuries later: crime born of poverty. His fictional society's solution wasn't more prisons or harsher punishments. It was to ensure everyone had enough to live on.</p>

<p>More wrote that instead of inflicting horrible punishments, "it would be far more to the point to provide everyone with some means of livelihood, so that nobody's under the frightful necessity of becoming first a thief, and then a corpse."</p>

<p>This was genuinely radical for its time. The prevailing view held that poverty was a moral failing, that the poor were lazy or sinful, and that harsh punishment was necessary to maintain social order. More suggested that perhaps people stole because they were hungry, and that feeding them might be more effective than hanging them.</p>

<h2>Thomas Paine and the Commons</h2>

<p>The American revolutionary Thomas Paine, whose pamphlet "Common Sense" helped spark the break with Britain, developed these ideas further in his 1797 essay "Agrarian Justice."</p>

<p>Paine's argument rested on a crucial distinction. The earth itself, he insisted, was given by the Creator to all humanity in common. Nobody made it. Nobody earned it. It simply exists, and all of us have an equal claim to it.</p>

<p>What individuals can legitimately own, Paine argued, are improvements to the land—the buildings, the farms, the infrastructure. But the underlying land value belongs to everyone.</p>

<p>From this principle, Paine derived a concrete proposal: a ten percent inheritance tax focused on land, with the proceeds distributed in two ways. Young adults would receive a one-time grant at age twenty-one—what we might now call a stakeholder grant. And everyone would receive ongoing old-age pensions and disability support.</p>

<p>"Men did not make the earth," Paine wrote. "It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds."</p>

<p>This idea—that certain natural resources belong to everyone and their value should be shared—would later develop into the economic philosophy called Georgism, named after the nineteenth-century economist Henry George. Georgists today often call a citizen's dividend funded by land taxes a "citizen's dividend" in honor of Paine's original vision.</p>

<h2>The Twentieth Century Debate</h2>

<p>The idea of basic income might have remained a philosophical curiosity if not for the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath.</p>

<p>As machines transformed production, two things became clear. First, society could produce far more goods than ever before. Second, the benefits of that production weren't being distributed evenly. By the early twentieth century, factories churned out products that most workers couldn't afford to buy.</p>

<p>The British engineer C.H. Douglas saw this paradox clearly. British industry was increasingly productive, yet most British citizens couldn't afford what was being produced. His solution, which he called "social credit," combined monetary reform with basic income payments. While Douglas's specific monetary theories were controversial, his identification of the problem—a gap between productive capacity and purchasing power—resonated widely.</p>

<p>Bertrand Russell, the philosopher and mathematician, made a different case for basic income in his 1918 book "Roads to Freedom." Russell wanted to combine what he saw as the advantages of socialism and anarchism. Basic income, he argued, would give everyone the security to refuse degrading work while preserving the incentive for productive people to earn more.</p>

<p>Russell proposed that "a certain small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income—as much larger as might be warranted by the total amount of commodities produced—should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful."</p>

<h2>The Negative Income Tax</h2>

<p>In 1962, the conservative economist Milton Friedman proposed what he called a "negative income tax." This was basic income in disguise.</p>

<p>Here's how it works. If your income falls below a certain threshold, instead of paying taxes to the government, the government pays you. The amount you receive decreases as your earnings increase, but gradually—so there's always an incentive to earn more. Eventually, as your income rises, you cross over from receiving money to paying taxes.</p>

<p>Friedman liked this approach because it could replace the sprawling welfare bureaucracy with a single, simple system administered through the existing tax code. No caseworkers. No means testing. No separate programs for housing, food, and utilities. Just one straightforward mechanism that ensures everyone has at least a minimum income.</p>

<p>The negative income tax isn't quite the same as universal basic income—it's targeted at lower-income people rather than truly universal—but the practical effects are similar. Everyone is guaranteed a floor below which they cannot fall.</p>

<p>Friedman's proposal caught the attention of politicians. In 1968, over twelve hundred economists signed a document calling for a guaranteed income for every American. President Lyndon Johnson, though he chose different approaches in his "War on Poverty," created a political climate where such ideas could be seriously discussed.</p>

<p>Then came the experiments.</p>

<h2>The Nixon Experiments</h2>

<p>Between 1968 and 1980, the United States conducted four large-scale experiments with guaranteed income, testing the negative income tax in New Jersey, rural Iowa and North Carolina, Gary (Indiana), and Seattle and Denver.</p>

<p>These experiments followed thousands of families over several years, randomly assigning some to receive guaranteed income while others served as controls. The goal was to answer the question that critics always raise: if you give people money for doing nothing, will they stop working?</p>

<p>The results were more nuanced than either side expected.</p>

<p>Work effort did decline—but not by much. Recipients worked about five to seven percent fewer hours on average. Most of this reduction came from secondary earners in households, often mothers who chose to spend more time with children, and from young people who stayed in school longer rather than dropping out to work.</p>

<p>What's often forgotten is that President Richard Nixon actually proposed implementing a version of guaranteed income nationally. His Family Assistance Plan would have provided both a safety net for the poor and financial incentives for welfare recipients to work. The plan passed the House of Representatives but died in the Senate, killed by an unusual coalition: conservatives who thought it too generous and liberals who thought it too stingy.</p>

<p>Congress did eventually approve a guaranteed minimum income, but only for two groups: the elderly (through Supplemental Security Income) and the disabled. The broader vision of income guarantees for all faded.</p>

<p>In its place rose the Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides money only to people who work. The EITC remains the largest anti-poverty program in America that provides cash to recipients, but its fundamental philosophy is different: it rewards work rather than guaranteeing survival.</p>

<h2>The Modern Revival</h2>

<p>For decades after the Nixon-era experiments, basic income remained mostly an academic interest, discussed at biennial conferences organized by the Basic Income Earth Network (founded in 1986) but rarely making headlines.</p>

<p>That changed in the 2010s.</p>

<p>In 2016, Switzerland held a national referendum on implementing basic income. The proposal failed overwhelmingly—over three-quarters of voters rejected it—but the very fact that a modern, wealthy nation was voting on the idea captured global attention. Switzerland became the first country to put basic income directly to voters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Silicon Valley was discovering basic income. Tech executives began to worry about automation. If artificial intelligence and robots could do most human jobs, what would happen to all the displaced workers? Basic income seemed like a possible answer.</p>

<p>Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, predicted that basic income would become necessary as AI advanced. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, funded research into the idea. Y Combinator, the prestigious startup incubator, launched a pilot program in Oakland, California.</p>

<p>Andrew Yang brought the idea into mainstream American politics during the 2020 Democratic primaries. His proposal, which he called a "Freedom Dividend," would have given every American adult one thousand dollars per month, no questions asked. Yang didn't win the nomination—that went to Joe Biden—but he outlasted most of the field and introduced millions of Americans to the concept.</p>

<h2>COVID and Cash</h2>

<p>Then came the pandemic.</p>

<p>When COVID-19 shut down economies worldwide in early 2020, governments faced an unprecedented challenge. Millions of workers couldn't work—not because they were lazy or lacked skills, but because their workplaces had closed to prevent disease spread. Traditional welfare systems, designed around the assumption that most people can and should work, were overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The response, in many countries, looked remarkably like basic income.</p>

<p>The United States sent direct payments to most citizens—not once, but three times. The first round provided $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. The second added $600 per person. The third gave $1,400 per person. These weren't means-tested in any serious way; even households earning over $150,000 received partial payments.</p>

<p>Other countries went even further. Spain, Hong Kong, and Japan implemented direct cash transfers. Around ninety countries and regions introduced some form of emergency cash distribution. Meanwhile, various "partial unemployment" schemes effectively subsidized workers' incomes without requiring them to work.</p>

<p>In Europe, a petition calling for "emergency basic income" gathered over 200,000 signatures. Polls showed widespread public support for the idea.</p>

<p>The pandemic didn't prove that basic income works. But it demonstrated that governments can, in fact, send money directly to citizens quickly and effectively when they choose to. The administrative barriers that supposedly made basic income impractical turned out to be less insurmountable than critics claimed.</p>

<h2>Pilot Programs Proliferate</h2>

<p>Since 2019, dozens of local experiments have launched across the United States and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Stockton, California, Mayor Michael Tubbs initiated a 24-month pilot that gave 125 residents $500 per month. The results, published after the program ended, showed that recipients didn't stop working. Instead, full-time employment actually increased among participants, possibly because the guaranteed income gave them stability to find better jobs rather than taking whatever desperate work they could find.</p>

<p>In Compton, California, the Compton Pledge began distributing guaranteed income to up to 800 low-income residents in 2021. Tacoma, Washington launched "Growing Resilience in Tacoma" the same year, providing $500 monthly to 110 families. The University of Pennsylvania's Center for Guaranteed Income Research is studying these and other programs to gather rigorous evidence.</p>

<p>These experiments share important limitations. They're small. They're temporary. And they're targeted at low-income populations rather than being truly universal. But they're generating real data about what happens when you give people unconditional cash.</p>

<h2>The Objections</h2>

<p>Critics of basic income raise three main objections.</p>

<p>The first is cost. Giving everyone enough money to live on would be extraordinarily expensive. If you gave every American adult $1,000 per month, that's roughly $3 trillion per year—more than the entire federal discretionary budget. Where would the money come from?</p>

<p>Basic income advocates have various answers. Some propose funding it through taxes on automation, carbon, or land values. Others argue that it would replace existing welfare programs, eliminating their administrative costs. Still others suggest that a partial basic income—not enough to live on, but a meaningful supplement—would be more feasible as a starting point.</p>

<p>The second objection is that people would stop working. Why would anyone show up to a difficult, boring, or dangerous job if they could just stay home and collect checks? This concern drove the negative income tax experiments of the 1970s and continues to animate the debate.</p>

<p>The evidence is mixed but not as dire as critics fear. Yes, some people reduce their work hours when they receive guaranteed income. But the reductions are modest, and they're often in categories we might welcome: parents spending more time with children, students staying in school, workers leaving abusive jobs they felt trapped in.</p>

<p>Advocates make a deeper point as well. If some jobs are so unpleasant that nobody would do them without being forced by poverty, maybe those jobs should be redesigned, automated, or paid better. Basic income would give workers bargaining power they currently lack.</p>

<p>The third objection is about fairness. Why should billionaires receive the same check as struggling single mothers? Isn't it wasteful to give money to people who don't need it?</p>

<p>This seems like common sense, but the counterargument is subtle. Means-tested programs require bureaucracy to determine who qualifies. That bureaucracy costs money and creates opportunities for error and abuse. Worse, means-testing creates stigma—the humiliation of having to prove you're poor enough to deserve help. A universal program avoids all of this. Yes, billionaires would receive basic income, but they'd also pay far more in taxes to fund it. The net effect would still be redistributive.</p>

<h2>The AI Question</h2>

<p>The most recent argument for basic income comes from projections about artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>The Institute for Public Policy Research, a British think tank, predicted in 2017 that 59 percent of tasks currently done by humans could be affected by artificial intelligence in the next three to five years. Other analysts have made similar predictions. If even a fraction of these predictions come true, what happens to all the workers whose jobs disappear?</p>

<p>Previous waves of automation didn't cause permanent mass unemployment. The workers displaced by tractors and assembly lines eventually found new jobs, often better ones. But some economists worry that this time is different—that AI is developing so quickly and becoming capable of so many different tasks that new job creation won't keep pace with job destruction.</p>

<p>Basic income, in this view, isn't just a nice idea—it's a necessary adaptation to a world where traditional employment may not be available to everyone who wants it.</p>

<p>Others are skeptical. They point out that predictions of technological unemployment have been made for centuries and never come true. The "jobs apocalypse" might be just as exaggerated as the "paperless office" or the "leisure society" that earlier generations predicted.</p>

<p>The honest answer is that we don't know. Nobody can reliably predict what AI will be capable of in ten or twenty years, or how quickly the economy will adapt. Basic income is either a prudent hedge against a possible future or a solution to a problem that may never materialize, depending on which predictions you believe.</p>

<h2>Beyond Left and Right</h2>

<p>One of the strangest things about basic income is its appeal across ideological lines.</p>

<p>Conservatives like it because it could replace the current welfare bureaucracy—the maze of food stamps, housing vouchers, disability payments, and dozens of other programs, each with its own eligibility rules and administrators. A single cash payment would be simpler, more respectful of individual choice, and potentially cheaper to administer.</p>

<p>Progressives like it because it provides a floor that ensures nobody falls into absolute poverty. It recognizes unpaid work—caring for children, elderly parents, or sick family members—that the market doesn't value. And it gives workers bargaining power to refuse exploitative jobs.</p>

<p>Libertarians like it because it treats people as adults capable of making their own decisions about how to spend money, rather than paternalistically dictating that this dollar must go to food and that dollar to housing.</p>

<p>Environmentalists see it as enabling people to work less, reducing the constant pressure for economic growth that drives environmental destruction.</p>

<p>This breadth of support might seem like an advantage, but it also creates problems. Different advocates want different things from basic income, and those differences matter for policy design. A conservative who wants to eliminate all other welfare programs and a progressive who wants to add basic income on top of existing programs aren't really advocating the same policy.</p>

<h2>What Would It Feel Like?</h2>

<p>Abstract debates about economics can obscure the most important question: what would it actually be like to live in a society with basic income?</p>

<p>Imagine knowing that no matter what happens—job loss, illness, divorce, a business failure—you won't starve. You might struggle. You might have to downsize. But the floor won't collapse beneath you.</p>

<p>Imagine being able to leave a job with an abusive boss without facing immediate destitution. Imagine having the breathing room to care for an aging parent, or to go back to school, or to start a business.</p>

<p>Imagine not having to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucracy to get help when you need it. No more proving to skeptical caseworkers that you really are looking for work, really do have a disability, really aren't hiding assets somewhere.</p>

<p>Or imagine the opposite scenario. Imagine everyone around you getting the same check, including people who seem perfectly capable of working but choose not to. Imagine paying higher taxes to fund benefits going to people who don't seem to need them. Imagine inflation eating away at the value of those payments as more money chases the same goods.</p>

<p>These imagined futures feel very different depending on your values, your circumstances, and your beliefs about human nature. That's part of why basic income debates generate such passion despite broad theoretical agreement that the idea has some merit.</p>

<h2>The Path Forward</h2>

<p>As of 2025, no country has implemented a full universal basic income. The Alaska Permanent Fund comes closest, but it's too small to live on. Iran and Mongolia tried partial versions but scaled them back. The pandemic-era cash transfers were temporary.</p>

<p>Yet the idea keeps gaining ground. More pilot programs launch every year. More economists study the results. More politicians include some version of it in their platforms.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most likely path forward is incremental. A child allowance here. An expanded earned income credit there. A carbon tax with revenue distributed equally to all citizens. Basic income by another name, arriving in pieces rather than all at once.</p>

<p>Or perhaps a crisis will force the issue. A pandemic worse than COVID. An AI revolution that really does eliminate millions of jobs. A political moment when the unthinkable becomes thinkable.</p>

<p>Thomas More proposed the idea in 1516. Thomas Paine refined it in 1797. Bertrand Russell championed it in 1918. Milton Friedman redesigned it in 1962. Andrew Yang campaigned on it in 2020.</p>

<p>Five centuries in, the idea that won't die still hasn't arrived. But it hasn't gone away either. And given the technological and economic changes ahead, its time might finally be coming.</p>
