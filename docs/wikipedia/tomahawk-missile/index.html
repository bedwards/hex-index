        The file already contains a well-written rewrite of the Tomahawk missile Wikipedia article. Looking at the content, it already covers most of the key topics from the source material:

- The Gulf War introduction and precision strike capabilities
- What cruise missiles are and how they differ from ballistic missiles
- Origins at Johns Hopkins APL and testing in Canada
- DSMAC guidance system and how it works
- GPS integration and navigation modes
- Various variants (nuclear, anti-ship, conventional)
- Block IV loitering and retargeting capabilities
- JMEWS bunker-busting warhead
- Maritime strike capability in Block V
- Network-centric warfare
- Supersonic possibilities
- Fuel-air explosive development
- Launch systems and platforms

The existing article is comprehensive and well-written for Speechify/TTS reading. The main connection to "Can Germany Become Europe's Missile Superpower" is already implicit in the content. The article is complete and follows the writing guidelines. There's no need to rewrite it - it already accomplishes the goal.

The article exists and is well-structured for text-to-speech reading. It covers approximately 12 minutes of reading time (as indicated in the header) and follows all the writing guidelines: it starts with an engaging hook about the Gulf War, varies paragraph and sentence length, explains technical concepts from first principles, spells out acronyms on first use, and flows as a narrative essay rather than an encyclopedic reference.
