<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism">Wikipedia: Antinatalism</a></p>

<p>In the fifth century before the common era, near the end of his long life, the Greek playwright Sophocles put words into the mouth of a blind, exiled king that have echoed through Western thought ever since: "Not to be born is, beyond all estimation, best." Oedipus, wandering at the edge of Athens after gouging out his own eyes and losing everything, delivers what might be the most pessimistic verdict ever pronounced on human existence. And remarkably, this ancient sentiment never quite disappeared. It has resurfaced across millennia, cultures, and religious traditions, finding its most systematic philosophical expression in our own time under a name that sounds almost clinical: antinatalism.</p>

<p>The word itself is straightforward enough. Where "natalism" refers to policies or philosophies that encourage childbirth, "antinatalism" opposes it—not merely as a personal lifestyle choice, but as an ethical position. Antinatalists argue that bringing new people into existence is morally wrong. Some go further, extending this judgment to all sentient creatures capable of suffering.</p>

<p>This is not, it's worth emphasizing, the same thing as governmental population control. China's one-child policy was antinatalist in its effects but not in its philosophical foundations. The bureaucrats who designed it weren't arguing that existence itself was harmful; they were worried about economic growth and resource constraints. Philosophical antinatalism makes a much more radical claim: that coming into existence is always a harm to the one who comes to exist.</p>

<h2>The Core Arguments</h2>

<p>Why would anyone believe such a thing?</p>

<p>The arguments tend to cluster around a few central observations. First, there's the brute fact of suffering. Every life, without exception, contains pain—physical agony, emotional distress, disappointment, loss, fear, and ultimately death. The fortunate among us experience these in manageable doses. The unfortunate are crushed by them. But no one escapes entirely.</p>

<p>Second, there's the matter of consent. You did not choose to exist. No one asked you whether you wanted to be born, whether you were willing to accept the terms of mortal life with all its attendant risks. Your parents made that decision for you, gambling with stakes they themselves would not have to pay.</p>

<p>This leads to the third argument: the asymmetry of risk. Some people end up genuinely happy. Others suffer tremendously. When prospective parents decide to have a child, they're essentially betting that their offspring will land on the favorable side of this distribution. But if they're wrong—if their child turns out to experience severe depression, chronic pain, or simply an accumulation of disappointments that outweighs life's pleasures—the child bears all the costs of this miscalculation.</p>

<p>The most philosophically sophisticated version of this argument comes from David Benatar, a South African philosopher whose 2006 book "Better Never to Have Been" gave antinatalism its modern intellectual framework. Benatar proposes what he calls the asymmetry argument, which works like this:</p>

<p>When someone exists, they experience both good things and bad things. We can all agree that the bad things (pain, suffering) are bad for them, and the good things (pleasure, fulfillment) are good for them. So far, so obvious.</p>

<p>But now consider someone who never exists. The absence of pain is good, Benatar argues—even if there's no one there to enjoy that absence. However, the absence of pleasure is not bad, because there's no one being deprived. This creates an asymmetry: non-existence avoids all the bad things (which is good) while missing the good things (which is merely neutral). The scales tip toward never being born.</p>

<p>Critics have challenged this reasoning from multiple angles. Some argue that the absence of pleasure really is bad, even if there's no specific person being harmed. Others point out that most people, when asked, say they're glad to be alive—which suggests that existence is not, in fact, experienced as a harm by those who exist. Benatar has responses to these objections, and his interlocutors have responses to his responses. The debate continues in philosophy journals.</p>

<h2>Ancient Roots</h2>

<p>What strikes me about antinatalism is how persistently the intuition surfaces, even in cultures that officially celebrate fertility and procreation. Sophocles was writing in Athens during its golden age, a society that valued large families and honored mothers of many sons. Yet here is one of its greatest artists suggesting that the optimal number of children is zero—indeed, that the optimal outcome would have been never to exist at all.</p>

<p>The passage is worth quoting at length:</p>

<blockquote>Not to be born is, beyond all estimation, best; but when a man has seen the light of day, this is next best by far, that with utmost speed he should go back from where he came. For when he has seen youth go by, with its easy merry-making, what hard affliction is foreign to him, what suffering does he not know? Envy, factions, strife, battles, and murders. Last of all falls to his lot old age, blamed, weak, unsociable, friendless, wherein dwells every misery among miseries.</blockquote>

<p>The structure of the argument is revealing. Sophocles doesn't deny that youth contains pleasures—"easy merry-making." But he treats these as temporary, almost illusory, against the accumulating weight of adult suffering: political conflict, violence, and finally the degradation of old age. Even the pleasures of youth become, in retrospect, a kind of trick, a brief respite before the suffering begins in earnest.</p>

<p>Similar sentiments appear in the Hebrew Bible. The book of Ecclesiastes, that strange text of world-weary wisdom, declares: "The day of death is better than the day of birth." The book of Job, in the depths of his undeserved suffering, curses the day he was born. These are not systematic philosophical arguments, but they reveal an undercurrent of doubt about whether existence is really worth the price of admission.</p>

<h2>The Buddhist Question</h2>

<p>Buddhism presents a particularly interesting case. The religion is founded on the observation that life is characterized by dukkha—a term often translated as "suffering" but better understood as a kind of pervasive unsatisfactoriness, a sense that things are never quite right. The First Noble Truth announces this as the fundamental condition of existence. The entire project of Buddhism, in some sense, is to find a way out.</p>

<p>Does this make Buddhism antinatalist? The question is surprisingly contested.</p>

<p>Hari Singh Gour, interpreting the Buddha's teaching, writes: "Oblivious of the suffering to which life is subject, man begets children, and is thus the cause of old age and death. If he would only realize what suffering he would add to by his act, he would desist from the procreation of children." This sounds like a straightforward antinatalist position: don't create new beings because existence is suffering.</p>

<p>The Beat writer Jack Kerouac certainly read Buddhism this way. His novels are full of characters trying to extinguish desire, to step off the wheel of birth and death, to achieve the non-existence that the Buddha seemed to recommend.</p>

<p>But Masahiro Morioka, a contemporary Japanese philosopher who has written extensively on antinatalism, argues that ancient Buddhism was both antinatalist and anti-antinatalist simultaneously. Yes, all births are births into the world of suffering, and in that sense existence is negatively valued. But there's a catch: only human beings can achieve nirvana. Only by being born into this world of suffering can one find the path to liberation. If you're never born, you never get the chance to escape the cycle entirely.</p>

<p>This creates a strange paradox. Existence is suffering, but existence is also the only exit from suffering. The Buddhist attitude toward birth is therefore deeply ambivalent—neither the simple affirmation of life found in most natalist cultures nor the simple negation proposed by philosophical antinatalists.</p>

<h2>Christian Complications</h2>

<p>Christianity presents its own complexities. The mainstream tradition has always been pro-natalist: "Be fruitful and multiply" is a divine command, children are a blessing, and the religion spread in part through the demographic advantage of encouraging large families.</p>

<p>Yet from the very beginning, there were Christian voices that pointed in a different direction.</p>

<p>Gregory of Nyssa, one of the Cappadocian Fathers who helped establish orthodox Christian theology in the fourth century, wrote that those who refrain from procreation by preserving their virginity "bring about a cancellation of death by preventing it from advancing further because of them." In other words, by not having children, you stop the chain of mortality. You become "a kind of boundary stone between life and death," keeping death from going forward.</p>

<p>Augustine of Hippo, perhaps the most influential theologian in Western Christianity, went even further. "Would that all would abstain from all sexual intercourse," he wrote. If everyone did, "much more speedily would the City of God be filled, and the end of the world hastened." Augustine imagines universal celibacy not as a disaster but as an acceleration of divine history—the faster humanity stops reproducing, the sooner God's plan reaches its fulfillment.</p>

<p>John Chrysostom, another Church Father, taught that spiritual perfection implies virginity. Jesus himself said "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it"—suggesting that celibacy, while not commanded, represents a higher path for those capable of walking it.</p>

<p>These weren't marginal voices. They were among the most revered teachers in Christian history. And while the mainstream church ultimately made room for both marriage and celibacy, treating them as different vocations rather than hierarchical grades of holiness, the antinatalist strain never entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Several Christian heretical movements took these ideas to their logical conclusion. The Marcionites, followers of the second-century teacher Marcion of Sinope, believed that the physical world was the creation of an evil deity—the jealous, angry god of the Hebrew Bible. The good God was entirely separate, a being of pure mercy who had nothing to do with material creation. For Marcionites, bringing children into this evil world meant collaborating with the malevolent creator.</p>

<p>The Encratites, whose name derives from the Greek word for self-control, observed that birth leads inevitably to death. Their solution was simple: stop producing "fresh fodder for death." If no one is born, no one has to die.</p>

<p>The Cathars, a medieval movement that flourished in southern France before being crushed by the Albigensian Crusade, held similar views. They believed that procreation imprisoned souls in evil matter, trapping the divine spark in flesh. Sex and reproduction were instruments of the evil god, the demiurge, used to perpetuate human suffering.</p>

<p>Even the Shakers, the eighteenth-century American sect known for their ecstatic worship and beautiful furniture, practiced strict celibacy. They believed that sex was the root of all sin. While they accepted converts and adopted orphans, they refused to propagate themselves biologically. Today only a handful of Shakers remain, their community slowly dwindling toward extinction—an outcome their theology would have considered not tragic but triumphant.</p>

<h2>Schopenhauer's Ambivalence</h2>

<p>The nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer is often claimed as an ancestor of modern antinatalism, though his actual position is more complicated than it first appears.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer was certainly one of Western philosophy's great pessimists. He believed that the fundamental nature of reality was something he called "will"—a blind, striving, insatiable force that drives all existence. Human beings are expressions of this will, and our characteristic suffering comes from its endless, unsatisfied desires. Life, in his famous phrase, "is a business that does not cover its costs."</p>

<p>He posed a memorable thought experiment:</p>

<blockquote>One should try to imagine that the act of procreation were neither a need, nor accompanied by sexual pleasure, but instead a matter of pure, rational reflection; could the human race even continue to exist? Would not everyone, on the contrary, have so much compassion for the coming generation that he would rather spare it the burden of existence, or at least refuse to take it upon himself to cold-bloodedly impose it on them?</blockquote>

<p>This sounds like antinatalism avant la lettre. If we thought clearly about what we were doing—creating beings who will suffer and die—we would stop doing it immediately.</p>

<p>And yet Schopenhauer's metaphysics complicates the picture. In his system, individual human beings are merely "appearances"—temporary manifestations of the underlying will. They don't really come into existence at birth, nor do they truly cease to exist at death. The will continues, expressing itself through other forms. So in the deepest sense, you can't prevent someone from existing by not having children, because the "someone" was never a real individual to begin with.</p>

<p>More importantly, Schopenhauer believed that the only genuine salvation lay in the will's self-negation—in recognizing the nature of reality so clearly that the will simply stops willing. This can only happen through a person. If you prevent someone from existing, you prevent them from achieving this redemption. The suffering of life, horrible as it is, serves as the necessary precondition for escaping the wheel of suffering entirely.</p>

<p>So Schopenhauer arrives at a strange position: he shares the antinatalist sentiment, agreeing that existence is suffering and that it would have been better not to begin. But he doesn't follow them to their conclusion, because he believes that existence—precisely because it is suffering—offers the only path to genuine liberation.</p>

<h2>Taoism and the Frozen River</h2>

<p>The scholar Robbert Zandbergen has drawn a fascinating parallel between antinatalism and Taoism, the ancient Chinese philosophical tradition associated with texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi.</p>

<p>Both traditions, Zandbergen argues, view the development of human consciousness as an aberration—a departure from what would otherwise be a fluid, harmonious universe. The difference is that Taoism imagines a possible return to this harmony, while antinatalism sees the problem as irreparable except through extinction.</p>

<p>The traditional Taoist symbol for the natural order is water: flowing, shapeless, adaptable, going where it will without resistance. Human consciousness, by contrast, is like ice—water that has frozen into rigid forms, stopped moving, become fixed in patterns and purposes.</p>

<p>An ancient Taoist text makes the antinatalist parallel explicit:</p>

<blockquote>Ice is better once it melts; how much better if it had never been frozen.</blockquote>

<p>A Taoist sage, through meditation and detachment, might be able to "melt" back into the natural flow—to dissolve the rigid structures of conscious selfhood and return to harmony with the Tao. This is the melting of ice into water. But the text adds: it would have been better if the freezing never happened in the first place. Better if human consciousness, with all its purposes and strivings and sufferings, had never arisen at all.</p>

<p>This is not quite antinatalism—Taoism doesn't argue that individuals should refrain from having children. But it shares with antinatalism a deep suspicion that consciousness itself might be the problem, that the very thing that makes us human might be a kind of cosmic error.</p>

<h2>Theodicy and Anthropodicy</h2>

<p>The problem of evil has troubled religious believers for millennia. If God is all-powerful and all-good, why does suffering exist? The various attempts to answer this question fall under the heading of "theodicy"—literally, the justification of God.</p>

<p>The Argentinian philosopher Julio Cabrera turns this question on its head. Just as we struggle to justify God's creation of a world containing evil, we should struggle to justify our own creation of children who will suffer. As human parents, we imitate the divine parent, bringing new beings into existence without their consent and hoping that the outcome will somehow be justified.</p>

<p>But can it be? Cabrera argues that just as theodicy fails—just as there is no satisfactory explanation for why a good God would permit such suffering—so too does what we might call "anthropodicy," the justification of human procreation. The same considerations that make the problem of evil so troubling for theists make the act of bringing children into the world troubling for everyone.</p>

<p>The German philosopher Karim Akerma develops this idea further. He argues that as religious belief declines, the question of anthropodicy becomes more urgent, not less. When people believed in God, they could at least outsource moral responsibility—the creator of the universe had set the terms of existence, and humans were just following the divine plan. But once that belief fades, we're left holding the moral weight ourselves. We cause suffering by bringing new people into existence, and we can no longer point to God as the ultimate author of the arrangement.</p>

<p>For Akerma, antinatalism follows directly from the failure of both theodicy and anthropodicy. If there's no justification for God creating a world of suffering, and no justification for humans perpetuating that world through procreation, then the ethical conclusion is to stop. No metaphysical system, no moral theory, can justify the production of new people.</p>

<h2>The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement</h2>

<p>At the far end of antinatalist thought lies VHEMT—the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, which pronounces its acronym as "vehement." Founded by an American activist named Les Knight in the 1990s, VHEMT advocates for the gradual extinction of the human species through universal voluntary refusal to reproduce.</p>

<p>Knight's reasoning is primarily environmental rather than philosophical. Humans, he argues, are causing immense harm to other species and to the planet. The most effective way to stop this harm would be for humans to disappear. And the most ethical way for humans to disappear would be not through violence or coercion but through the simple decision, made by each person individually, not to create new humans.</p>

<p>VHEMT occupies an interesting position in the landscape of antinatalist thought. It's not really philosophical antinatalism in the strict sense—Knight isn't primarily arguing that existence is harmful to those who exist, but rather that human existence is harmful to everything else. It's more like extreme environmentalism carried to its logical conclusion.</p>

<p>A more extreme position is held by proponents of "efilism"—"life" spelled backward—who argue not just for voluntary human extinction but for the elimination of all sentient life. The suffering inherent in existence, on this view, is not limited to humans but afflicts every creature capable of experiencing pain. The ethical imperative is therefore not just to stop creating humans but to somehow bring an end to all life.</p>

<p>These movements remain marginal, but they illustrate how antinatalist reasoning can be extended. If existence really is a harm, why limit the analysis to humans? And if preventing suffering is the goal, why stop at voluntary measures?</p>

<h2>Gustave Flaubert's Horror</h2>

<p>Not all antinatalist sentiment takes philosophical form. Sometimes it appears as raw visceral revulsion.</p>

<p>The French novelist Gustave Flaubert, best known for Madame Bovary, wrote in an 1846 letter:</p>

<blockquote>The idea of bringing someone into the world fills me with horror. I would curse myself if I were a father. A son of mine! Oh no, no, no! May my entire flesh perish and may I transmit to no one the aggravations and the disgrace of existence.</blockquote>

<p>This is not an argument but a cry of anguish. Flaubert doesn't reason his way to antinatalism; he feels it in his bones. The prospect of fatherhood fills him with something approaching nausea. To create a child would be to perpetuate what he calls "the disgrace of existence"—to inflict upon an innocent being the same sufferings and humiliations that Flaubert himself endures.</p>

<p>Flaubert never did have children. Whether this was due to his antinatalist convictions, his unconventional lifestyle, or simple circumstance is hard to say. But the letter reveals how deeply the antinatalist intuition can run, how it can feel less like a philosophical conclusion than like an instinctive recoil.</p>

<h2>The Childless by Choice</h2>

<p>It's worth distinguishing antinatalism from the simpler phenomenon of choosing not to have children. Many people decide against parenthood for reasons that have nothing to do with philosophy—they don't want to sacrifice their freedom, they don't think they'd be good parents, they can't afford it, or they simply don't feel the desire. These people are "childfree," in the contemporary terminology, but they're not antinatalists.</p>

<p>An antinatalist believes that having children is morally wrong, or at least morally problematic. They might respect other people's choices to become parents while believing those choices are ethically mistaken. They might feel compassion for parents rather than judgment, recognizing that the urge to reproduce is powerful and that most people haven't thought carefully about the ethics involved.</p>

<p>But the core claim is ethical, not merely personal: procreation harms the person created, and therefore we have strong moral reasons not to do it.</p>

<h2>Living with the Conclusion</h2>

<p>What would it mean to take antinatalism seriously?</p>

<p>At the individual level, it would mean choosing not to have biological children. Some antinatalists argue that adoption is acceptable, even praiseworthy—you're not creating a new sufferer, merely helping one who already exists. Others extend their arguments to include any form of parenting, on the grounds that even adoptive parents are making decisions about the future of a being who cannot consent.</p>

<p>At the social level, antinatalism sits awkwardly with almost every political philosophy. Conservatives value family and tradition; antinatalism would end them. Progressives work to improve conditions for future generations; antinatalism would eliminate those generations. Even environmentalists, who often worry about overpopulation, typically want to reduce birth rates rather than eliminate them entirely.</p>

<p>The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard, whose relationship to antinatalism is complex, wrote that "man enters this world by means of a crime" and that Christianity "aims at stopping the whole continuation which leads to the permanence of this world." But Kierkegaard remained a Christian and presumably did not think that the proper response to the fallen state of humanity was to simply stop existing. His antinatalist sentiments were caught up in a larger theological vision that ultimately pointed toward redemption rather than extinction.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's where most people who take antinatalist arguments seriously end up. They recognize the force of the reasoning. They acknowledge that existence involves suffering, that children cannot consent to being born, that every parent is taking a gamble with stakes that someone else will pay. And yet they find themselves unable to act consistently on these conclusions—either because the desire to reproduce is too strong, or because they hold out hope that the suffering can be redeemed, or simply because they cannot bring themselves to believe that their own lives, with all their pain, would have been better never to have occurred.</p>

<p>The antinatalist stands at the end of a long tradition of human ambivalence about existence. From Sophocles's blind king to contemporary philosophy journals, the intuition keeps returning: perhaps it would have been better never to have been. Most of us, most of the time, push this thought away. We continue living, continue loving, continue creating new lives to replace our own. But the question lingers, unanswerable and uncomfortable, like an ache that never quite goes away.</p>
