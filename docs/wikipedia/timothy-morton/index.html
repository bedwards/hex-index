        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Timothy Morton and hyperobjects. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with a compelling hook about hyperobjects rather than a dry biography
- Explains Morton's intellectual journey from Romantic poetry to ecological philosophy
- Breaks down complex concepts like "the mesh" and "strange strangers" in accessible language
- Details the five characteristics of hyperobjects with clear examples
- Addresses criticism from scholars like Ursula Heise
- Connects Morton's ideas to AI systems, making it relevant to the source Substack article about AI nerds
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good Speechify reading

The HTML is clean and semantic, ready for text-to-speech processing. Should I try writing it to a different location, or would you like to grant write permission to that directory?
