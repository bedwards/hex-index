<p>New York City employs roughly 330,000 people. That's more workers than any other American city, and more than all but three U.S. states. To put that in perspective, the city government has more employees than the entire states of Massachusetts or Washington. This massive workforce runs everything from the nation's largest public school system to the subways, from sanitation to public hospitals, from parks to police.</p>

<p>And at the top of this enormous bureaucratic machine sits a mayor working out of City Hall in Lower Manhattan.</p>

<h2>The Peculiar Structure of City Power</h2>

<p>New York City's government exists in a category all its own. Technically, the city encompasses five counties, each retaining some autonomy—particularly their own district attorneys and court systems. This means New York isn't legally considered an independent city or a consolidated city-county. It's sui generis, a Latin term meaning "of its own kind."</p>

<p>The five counties correspond exactly to the five boroughs: Brooklyn is Kings County, the Bronx is Bronx County, Manhattan is New York County, Queens is Queens County, and Staten Island is Richmond County. When the modern city was consolidated in 1898, all previous town and county governments were abolished in favor of a unified city government. But the county structure persisted underneath, creating a unique hybrid that has shaped city politics ever since.</p>

<h2>How the Mayor Runs the Show</h2>

<p>The mayor is elected every four years and serves as the city's chief executive and magistrate. The mayor appoints and removes unelected officers, creates the city budget through the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget, and exercises all powers vested in the city unless the law specifies otherwise. Essentially, if you're working for the city government and you weren't elected to your position, the mayor can fire you.</p>

<p>But the mayor doesn't govern alone. Two other officials are elected citywide: the Public Advocate and the Comptroller.</p>

<p>The Public Advocate serves as the city's ombudsman—a Scandinavian word meaning someone who investigates complaints against the government. The Public Advocate investigates problems with city agencies, mediates disputes between agencies and citizens, and advises the mayor on community relations. Crucially, the Public Advocate stands first in the line of succession if the mayor can't serve. Think of this role as the city's institutional conscience and backup mayor.</p>

<p>The Comptroller, meanwhile, is the city's financial watchdog. This office audits all city agencies, manages five public pension funds totaling nearly $160 billion in assets, reviews contracts for integrity and compliance, and ensures transparency in wage-setting processes. The Comptroller is second in line for the mayoralty after the Public Advocate. In other words, New York's accountant-in-chief is one heartbeat away from running the city.</p>

<h2>The City Council's Power</h2>

<p>Legislative power rests with the New York City Council, a unicameral body—meaning it has just one chamber, unlike Congress with its Senate and House. The Council has 51 members, each representing a district of roughly 157,000 people. These districts are redrawn after every census conducted in years divisible by twenty, which creates an unusual election pattern: after redistricting, council members serve two consecutive two-year terms instead of the normal four-year term.</p>

<p>The Speaker of the Council, chosen by the 51 members, is often considered the second most powerful person in city government after the mayor. This makes sense when you understand the legislative process: bills pass by simple majority, then go to the mayor for signature. If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override with a two-thirds vote. That means a skilled Speaker who can rally votes holds tremendous leverage.</p>

<p>Local laws passed by the Council have the same legal status as laws enacted by the New York State Legislature—with certain exceptions and restrictions. They supersede older forms of municipal legislation like ordinances, resolutions, and regulations. This gives the Council real teeth when it wants to make policy.</p>

<h2>The Board That Was Too Powerful</h2>

<p>Until 1990, New York City had an unusual governing body called the Board of Estimate. This was a legislative-executive hybrid with no parallel anywhere else in the United States. It couldn't pass laws, but it shared budget authority with the Council and controlled land use, contracts, franchises, and utility rates.</p>

<p>The Board's membership was small but powerful: the mayor, comptroller, and City Council president each cast two votes, while the five borough presidents each cast one vote. This structure gave Brooklyn—with 2.2 million residents—the same voting power as Staten Island with 350,000 residents.</p>

<p>In 1989, the Supreme Court struck down the Board of Estimate as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. The ruling invoked the court's 1964 "one man, one vote" principle, which requires legislative districts to have roughly equal populations. Having Brooklyn's borough president wield the same single vote as Staten Island's violated this fundamental democratic principle.</p>

<p>The city responded with a charter revision, approved by 55 percent of voters in November 1989 and cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice a month later. The Board of Estimate was dissolved. Borough presidents, once powerful figures who controlled patronage and sat on the Board, became largely ceremonial.</p>

<h2>Borough Presidents: Echoes of Former Glory</h2>

<p>When the five boroughs consolidated in 1898, the new charter created five borough president offices to preserve, in one writer's words, "local pride and affection for the old municipalities." These positions absorbed responsibilities from the former mayors of Brooklyn and Long Island City, from town executives in Queens and Richmond, and from various county functions.</p>

<p>Originally, borough presidents wielded real power. They sat on the Board of Estimate. They controlled patronage through the ability to appoint secretaries, assistants, and clerks. They influenced budgets, land use, contracts, and franchises. The position became a reward for loyal party servants or a stepping stone to higher office—Robert F. Wagner, Jr. used the Manhattan borough presidency as a springboard to become mayor.</p>

<p>After the Board of Estimate was abolished in 1990, borough presidents lost most of their authority. Their last significant power—appointing members of the Board of Education—vanished when that board became the Department of Education in 2002.</p>

<p>Today, borough presidents have small discretionary budgets for local projects. They can introduce legislation in the Council, recommend capital projects, hold public hearings, and make recommendations to the mayor. They appoint one member to the City Planning Commission and two members to the Panel for Educational Policy. They influence the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure by appointing community board members and voting on applications.</p>

<p>Mostly, though, they serve as advocates—lobbying mayoral agencies, the Council, state government, and private businesses on behalf of their borough. They've become cheerleaders and conveners rather than wielders of hard power.</p>

<h2>The Court System's Complexity</h2>

<p>New York City's court system is notoriously complex, spanning both citywide and statewide courts across the five counties. Understanding it requires distinguishing between trial courts, which hear cases initially, and appellate courts, which review decisions.</p>

<p>Two citywide courts handle most routine matters. The Criminal Court handles summons tickets, violations, and misdemeanors—crimes punishable by fine or up to one year in prison. It also conducts arraignments and preliminary hearings for felony cases. The Civil Court includes Housing Court for landlord-tenant disputes, Small Claims Court for cases up to $5,000, and generally handles damages up to $25,000. Civil Court processes about 25 percent of all filings in New York state and local courts combined.</p>

<p>Statewide courts operate in all five boroughs. The Supreme Court of New York State is the trial court of general jurisdiction—confusingly named, since it's not the highest court despite the name. In New York City, Supreme Court hears felony cases and major civil matters. Family Court handles cases involving children and families. Surrogate's Court is the probate court, overseeing wills and estates.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of New York State, New York City counties don't have typical County Courts. The city's unique structure demanded different judicial arrangements.</p>

<p>There are also administrative courts outside the state Unified Court System. The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, known as OATH, adjudicates matters for city agencies. The Parking Violations Bureau handles parking tickets. These are executive agencies, not part of the judiciary, which adds another layer of complexity.</p>

<h2>Federal Jurisdiction Split</h2>

<p>New York City is divided between two federal judicial districts. The Bronx and Manhattan fall within the Southern District of New York, one of the most prominent federal courts in the country. Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island belong to the Eastern District of New York. Both districts have concurrent jurisdiction over waters in their respective areas, meaning federal maritime cases can be filed in either court depending on where the incident occurred.</p>

<p>This split reflects both geography and history. The Southern District, established in 1789, has handled some of the nation's most significant cases involving Wall Street, organized crime, terrorism, and public corruption. The Eastern District, while lower profile, processes a huge volume of immigration cases and criminal prosecutions.</p>

<h2>Community Boards and Local Input</h2>

<p>Below the borough level sit 59 community districts, each with its own community board. These boards hold public hearings, review land use applications, and make recommendations on municipal services. They have no binding authority, but they provide official channels for neighborhood voices to reach city government.</p>

<p>Borough presidents appoint community board members, which remains one of their few meaningful powers. In practice, community boards range from highly active civic forums to sleepy rubber-stamp operations, depending on the neighborhood and the personalities involved.</p>

<h2>Primary Elections and Term Limits</h2>

<p>New York City uses ranked choice voting for primary elections for local offices, a reform adopted to reduce the influence of machine politics and give voters more say. In general elections, the city uses plurality voting—whoever gets the most votes wins, even without a majority.</p>

<p>All elected officials face a two consecutive-term limit. You can serve two terms, sit out at least one term, then run again—but you can't hold the same office for more than eight consecutive years. This creates regular turnover and prevents the lifetime incumbencies that once characterized city politics.</p>

<h2>The City Record and Regulations</h2>

<p>Every weekday except legal holidays, the city publishes the City Record, its official journal containing legal notices from city agencies. Regulations are compiled in the Rules of the City of New York. These documents, dry as they are, constitute the actual machinery of governance—the administrative law that shapes everything from building codes to vendor licenses to noise ordinances.</p>

<p>Most New Yorkers never read the City Record. But within its pages, you can watch the city government in real time: contract awards, public hearings, rule changes, agency decisions. It's the municipal equivalent of the Federal Register, a record of bureaucracy in motion.</p>

<h2>A Government for Eight Million</h2>

<p>Governing New York City means managing a population larger than 39 of the 50 states. The municipal structure reflects this scale: massive employment, divided jurisdiction between city and state courts, borough-level advocacy offices, and layers of administrative agencies. It's a government built through accretion—the 1898 consolidation, the early twentieth-century Progressive reforms, the post-Board of Estimate restructuring—each era leaving its mark on the institutional architecture.</p>

<p>What emerges is a system of both concentration and diffusion. The mayor holds enormous executive power. But the Comptroller watches the money, the Public Advocate watches the agencies, the Council controls legislation, the borough presidents lobby for local interests, the community boards channel neighborhood input, and the courts—city, state, and federal—adjudicate disputes. It's a machine with many moving parts, not all of them perfectly aligned, somehow managing to deliver services to millions of people every single day.</p>
