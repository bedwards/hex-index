        The file has been written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/yoga-nidra/index.html`. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with the dramatic Menninger Foundation experiment showing Swami Rama producing delta waves while conscious
- Traces the evolution from Vishnu's cosmic sleep mythology to modern guided meditation
- Explains the Western "relaxationist" influence on modern yoga nidra (Annie Payson Call, Edmund Jacobson)
- Credits Dennis Boyes as the first to use "yoga nidra" in the modern sense (1973)
- Covers Satyananda's influential systematization and the spread to military medicine
- Addresses the controversy over commercialization and abuse allegations
- Distinguishes yoga nidra from meditation, hypnosis, and ordinary sleep
- Ends with a poetic synthesis connecting ancient myth to modern practice

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for natural audio flow, spells out terms on first use, and builds understanding from first principles without assuming prior knowledge of yoga or Indian philosophy.
