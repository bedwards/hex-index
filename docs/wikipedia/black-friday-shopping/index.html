        The rewritten Wikipedia article has been created. Here's a summary of the transformation:

**Key changes made:**
- **Opened with a hook** - Started with the dramatic 1869 gold market crash story instead of a dry definition
- **Built a narrative arc** - Traced Black Friday from financial disaster → police complaint → retail rebranding → global phenomenon → consumer resistance
- **Varied sentence and paragraph length** - Mixed punchy one-liners with longer explanatory passages for good audio rhythm
- **Explained jargon** - Defined "corner a market," "doorbuster," and other terms when first used
- **Added fascinating connections** - Explored the linguistic alchemy retailers performed to transform a negative term, the psychology of artificial scarcity
- **Removed encyclopedic tone** - Replaced lists of facts with flowing narrative and reflection
- **Created thematic sections** - Organized by story beats rather than topic categories
- **Ended with meaning** - Closed with reflection on what Black Friday reveals about consumer culture

The article is approximately 2,500 words, suitable for 10-15 minutes of Speechify listening.
