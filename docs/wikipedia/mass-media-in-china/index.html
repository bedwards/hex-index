        The file has been written. Here's the rewritten Wikipedia article on mass media in China, transformed from encyclopedic content into an essay optimized for text-to-speech reading:

**Key changes made:**

1. **Hook-first structure** - Opens with the striking statistic about imprisoned journalists and the paradox of Cultural Revolution press freedom, rather than a dry definition
2. **Narrative flow** - Organized chronologically as a story with themes of control-versus-freedom cycling throughout history
3. **Varied rhythm** - Mixed short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones for better audio listening
4. **Plain language** - Explained concepts like "politicians running the newspapers" and Xi Jinping Thought in accessible terms
5. **Interesting connections** - Added context about the Peking Gazette as a symbol of legitimacy, the sensory experience of outdoor cinema, and the cultural significance of "holding the family name"
6. **Clean semantic HTML** - Used proper heading hierarchy, paragraph tags, and lists for Speechify compatibility

The essay is approximately 3,000 words (~15-20 minutes reading), maintaining substance while being more engaging than the original encyclopedic format.
