        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Japan Innovation Party. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with the dramatic 2021 election breakthrough as a hook
- Explains the 1955 System and Japan's unusual one-party dominance
- Traces the party's origins through Hashimoto's colorful personality
- Explains Dōshūsei (regional federalism) in accessible terms
- Covers the Osaka Metropolitan Plan referendum defeats
- Addresses the party's Tokyo struggles
- Details the 2021 breakthrough and 2025 confidence and supply agreement
- Includes the Maruyama scandal as an example of party discipline
- Ends with reflection on whether insurgents become establishment

The article is approximately 2,500 words, suitable for a 10-15 minute read, with varied paragraph and sentence lengths optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

However, I'm blocked from writing the file due to permissions. The directory needs to be created and I need write access to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/japan-innovation-party/index.html`.
