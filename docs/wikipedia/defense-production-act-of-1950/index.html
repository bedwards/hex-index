<h2>The President's Emergency Shopping Cart</h2>

<p>Imagine walking into a factory and telling the owner: "Whatever you're making, stop. You work for me now." That's essentially what the Defense Production Act allows the President of the United States to do. It's one of the most sweeping economic powers any American president holds, yet most people have never heard of it until a crisis hits.</p>

<p>The law burst into public consciousness during the COVID-19 pandemic, when suddenly everyone was debating whether the government should force companies to make ventilators and face masks. But this wasn't some dusty relic being pulled off a shelf. The Defense Production Act has been invoked hundreds of times since 1950, shaping everything from the aluminum in your soda can to the semiconductors in your phone.</p>

<h2>Born from the Korean Crucible</h2>

<p>The story begins on a Sunday morning in June 1950, when North Korean forces poured across the 38th parallel into South Korea. The United States had just finished demobilizing from World War II. Factories that had churned out tanks and planes were back to making cars and refrigerators. The mighty arsenal of democracy had gone back to sleep.</p>

<p>President Harry Truman faced a nightmare scenario. American troops were being rushed to Korea with inadequate equipment. The military needed everything—steel, rubber, electronics, fuel—and it needed it yesterday. But in a free market economy, the government couldn't simply seize factories or force companies to change what they produced.</p>

<p>Or could it?</p>

<p>On September 8, 1950, Congress passed the Defense Production Act, giving Truman extraordinary powers over the American economy. The law was designed as a temporary emergency measure, expected to expire once the Korean conflict ended. Instead, it has been reauthorized more than fifty times and remains in force today, nearly seventy-five years later.</p>

<h2>What the Law Actually Does</h2>

<p>The Defense Production Act operates through three main mechanisms, each giving the president a different tool for steering the economy toward national defense needs.</p>

<p><strong>Title I: Priority Contracts.</strong> This is the power to cut in line. The president can designate certain goods as "critical and strategic" and require companies to prioritize government contracts over all other orders. If the military needs semiconductors and you're a chip manufacturer, Uncle Sam's order goes to the front of the queue. Your commercial customers will have to wait.</p>

<p>The Department of Defense runs a rating system to manage these priorities. The highest rating, called DX, requires approval from the Secretary of Defense and essentially means "drop everything." Below that is DO, and below that are unrated contracts that proceed through normal business channels.</p>

<p><strong>Title III: Allocation and Creation.</strong> This provision lets the president go beyond just prioritizing existing production. It authorizes creating new regulatory bodies, issuing orders, and directing how materials, services, and facilities flow through the economy. If an entire industry needs to be built from scratch, Title III provides the blueprint.</p>

<p><strong>Title VII: Economic Control.</strong> The broadest authority lives here. The president can regulate the civilian economy to ensure that scarce materials essential for defense don't get diverted to non-essential uses. Think of it as economic triage during a crisis.</p>

<h2>The Powers That Got Away</h2>

<p>The original 1950 law was even more expansive. Four additional sections granted powers that would seem almost dictatorial by today's standards.</p>

<p>Title II allowed the president to seize private property outright. Title IV authorized wage and price controls, plus rationing of consumer goods. Title V permitted the use of force to settle labor disputes. Title VI controlled real estate lending.</p>

<p>All of these provisions have expired and been repealed. The law's authors always intended it as emergency legislation, not a permanent expansion of executive power. Over the decades, Congress has steadily trimmed back the most extreme authorities while keeping the core industrial mobilization tools intact.</p>

<p>One interesting vestige remains: while the president can no longer fix prices, Title I still includes a provision against hoarding. The government can prevent people from stockpiling designated items and selling them above prevailing market prices. This provision proved surprisingly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic, when some people tried to corner markets on hand sanitizer and medical supplies.</p>

<h2>Building Industries from Scratch</h2>

<p>The Defense Production Act's most lasting legacy may be industries that most Americans don't even realize the government helped create.</p>

<p>Take aluminum. Before the 1950s, the United States had limited domestic capacity for this lightweight metal that would become essential for aircraft, spacecraft, and eventually beverage containers. Using the DPA's authorities, the Department of Defense provided capital, interest-free loans, and directed both mining resources and skilled workers toward building an American aluminum industry. The same approach created the domestic titanium industry, which today supplies everything from military aircraft to artificial hip joints.</p>

<p>The DPA also shaped the geography of American manufacturing. During the early Cold War, military planners worried about a single Soviet nuclear strike wiping out the nation's industrial capacity. Using the act, they directed government-funded factories to disperse across the country rather than clustering in traditional manufacturing centers. This deliberate geographic spreading influenced where factories—and the communities around them—would grow for generations.</p>

<h2>From Pipelines to Semiconductors</h2>

<p>The law's definition of "national defense" has evolved remarkably since 1950, each expansion reflecting changing American priorities.</p>

<p>In 1970, Congress amended the DPA to include space activity. The moon landing had happened just a year earlier, and legislators recognized that space capabilities were becoming integral to national security.</p>

<p>A decade later, in 1980, came perhaps the most significant conceptual expansion: energy was designated as a material good under the act. This meant the government could invoke DPA authorities to secure energy resources and production facilities. The amendment reflected the painful lessons of the 1970s oil crises, when foreign supply disruptions had brought the American economy to its knees.</p>

<p>The energy expansion enabled some creative uses. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, that 800-mile engineering marvel carrying oil from Prudhoe Bay to the port of Valdez, received DPA support. So did the United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a now-defunct effort to develop alternatives to imported oil. Research into liquefied natural gas—now a major American export—also benefited from DPA-directed resources.</p>

<p>In 1992, Congress opened the door for small businesses to participate in DPA-directed production, recognizing that innovation often comes from smaller, more agile companies rather than industrial giants.</p>

<p>Then came 2003, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Congress amended the DPA to include "critical infrastructure protection and restoration" as a national security concern. The same amendment specifically identified radiation-hardened electronics—circuits designed to survive nuclear electromagnetic pulses—as a category the act could address. The Cold War might have ended, but the nuclear threat hadn't disappeared entirely.</p>

<h2>Seed Money for Tomorrow's Technologies</h2>

<p>Starting in the 1980s, the Department of Defense discovered a new use for the Defense Production Act: venture capital.</p>

<p>Rather than just prioritizing production of existing goods, the DOD began using DPA contracting and spending provisions to provide seed money for developing entirely new technologies. The defense establishment essentially became a patient investor in cutting-edge research, willing to fund risky projects that commercial markets might not support.</p>

<p>The technologies that emerged from this approach read like a tour of modern materials science: silicon carbide ceramics, which can withstand extreme temperatures; indium phosphide and gallium arsenide semiconductors, which outperform silicon in certain applications; microwave power tubes; superconducting wire; advanced metal composites.</p>

<p>Particularly significant has been DPA support for rare earth mineral mining and processing. These seventeen elements with exotic names like neodymium and dysprosium are essential for everything from smartphone screens to wind turbines to precision-guided missiles. China currently dominates global rare earth production, a strategic vulnerability the United States has been trying to address through DPA-funded domestic mining operations.</p>

<h2>Crisis Response: From Blackouts to Pandemics</h2>

<p>Beyond industrial policy, the DPA has become a crisis management tool, invoked when ordinary market mechanisms can't respond fast enough to emergencies.</p>

<p>In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order connecting the DPA to disaster preparedness. This allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (which everyone now knows by its acronym FEMA) to coordinate with other federal departments in ordering producers and distributors to prioritize resources before and during disasters.</p>

<p>Then came a more controversial use. In January 2001, California was experiencing rolling blackouts during an electricity crisis caused by market manipulation and supply problems. Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest utility, had stopped paying its gas suppliers, who in turn were cutting off service. Clinton invoked the DPA to force gas suppliers to keep delivering to PG&E regardless of non-payment.</p>

<p>This was a remarkable intervention: the federal government essentially commanding private companies to provide goods without compensation. The order was rescinded after George W. Bush took office, contributing to expanded blackouts and PG&E's eventual bankruptcy. The episode demonstrated both the power of the DPA and the complications that can arise when the government overrides normal business relationships.</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity and National Defense</h2>

<p>In 2011, President Barack Obama used the Defense Production Act for something that would have puzzled the law's 1950 authors: combating Chinese cyberespionage.</p>

<p>Obama invoked the DPA to force telecommunications companies, under criminal penalties, to provide detailed information to the Commerce Department about foreign-manufactured hardware and software in their networks. The concern was that equipment made overseas—particularly in China—might contain hidden backdoors allowing foreign intelligence agencies to spy on American communications.</p>

<p>This use of the law represented a significant expansion of the "national defense" concept. The DPA wasn't being used to make things; it was being used to gather information about potential security vulnerabilities in existing infrastructure. The boundaries of the law continued to stretch.</p>

<h2>The COVID-19 Moment</h2>

<p>Most Americans first heard the phrase "Defense Production Act" in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the nation's healthcare system.</p>

<p>Hospitals were running out of ventilators—machines that breathe for patients whose lungs can't function on their own. Medical workers lacked personal protective equipment like N95 masks and gowns. Testing supplies were scarce. The normal supply chains, optimized for efficiency rather than resilience, couldn't adapt fast enough.</p>

<p>On March 18, 2020, President Donald Trump signed an executive order invoking the DPA, designating ventilators and personal protective equipment as "essential to the national defense." Peter Navarro, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, became the coordinator for DPA actions, while Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar received authority to determine needed quantities of supplies.</p>

<p>Initially, Trump was reluctant to use the DPA's more coercive powers, preferring to let companies volunteer for medical equipment production. Fifty-seven Democratic representatives wrote urging him to invoke the act more aggressively. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, publicly pushed for faster action.</p>

<p>By early April, the administration had expanded its DPA use to require six companies—including General Motors, Ford, General Electric, and Medtronic—to secure supplies and manufacture ventilators. The auto giants, their assembly lines idled by the pandemic, retooled to build medical equipment instead of cars.</p>

<p>On April 28, Trump used the DPA to keep meat and poultry plants operating, designating them as critical infrastructure. This order proved controversial. Workers at these facilities faced high COVID-19 infection rates due to crowded working conditions, and critics argued the government was prioritizing meat production over worker safety.</p>

<h2>The Biden Acceleration</h2>

<p>When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, he invoked the Defense Production Act on his second day, dramatically expanding its use for pandemic response. The administration directed resources toward protective equipment production and, crucially, vaccine manufacturing.</p>

<p>In March 2021, Biden invoked the DPA to supply equipment to Merck pharmaceutical facilities that were helping manufacture Johnson & Johnson vaccines. This represented an unusual situation: one pharmaceutical giant helping a competitor produce vaccines, with government intervention smoothing the way.</p>

<p>But the Biden administration's DPA use extended well beyond the pandemic.</p>

<p>In September 2021, during California's devastating wildfire season, Biden invoked the act for something that sounds almost mundane: fire hoses. The main American producer of fire hoses for the Forest Service is NewView Oklahoma, a company that employs visually impaired and blind workers. Their production had halted during the pandemic. Biden's DPA invocation restarted operations, resulting in over 21,000 new fire hoses delivered to firefighters on California's front lines.</p>

<p>In December 2021, the DPA was invoked to support Virginia-class attack submarine production—a more traditional defense use, addressing parts shortages and workforce training needs for the Navy's most advanced undersea vessels.</p>

<h2>The Clean Energy Pivot</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most significant recent evolution of the Defense Production Act involves climate change and clean energy.</p>

<p>In March 2022, President Biden invoked the DPA to increase domestic extraction of minerals critical to the clean energy transition: lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and manganese. These elements are essential for large-capacity batteries used in electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage.</p>

<p>The strategic logic parallels earlier uses of the law. Just as the 1980 amendment recognized energy as a national security concern during the oil crisis era, the Biden administration argued that dependence on foreign sources—particularly China, Russia, and other potentially hostile nations—for battery minerals created an unacceptable vulnerability.</p>

<p>Currently, most of these minerals are mined and processed overseas. The United States produces almost no lithium domestically, despite having significant deposits. Building domestic supply chains for these materials became, in the administration's framing, a national defense imperative.</p>

<p>In June 2022, Biden went further, invoking the DPA to accelerate domestic production of multiple green energy technologies: solar panels, transformers and electric grid components, heat pumps, insulation, electrolyzers, fuel cells, and platinum group metals. The invocation coincided with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global energy markets and sent prices soaring.</p>

<p>This use of the DPA has created interesting tensions within the environmental community. Some advocates celebrate the government's commitment to rapidly scaling clean energy production. Others worry about the environmental damage from mining operations, even when those mines produce materials for batteries and solar panels. The debate reflects a genuine dilemma: achieving clean energy goals may require extractive industries that themselves cause ecological harm.</p>

<h2>Baby Formula and Foreign Investment</h2>

<p>The law's reach continued expanding in unexpected directions.</p>

<p>In May 2022, a contamination scare forced the closure of a major infant formula plant in Michigan, creating a nationwide shortage. Parents struggled to find food for their babies; some resorted to dangerous homemade concoctions. Biden invoked the DPA to require formula ingredient manufacturers to prioritize orders to key suppliers. He also authorized the use of Defense Department aircraft to import formula from overseas—a logistical operation that became known as "Operation Fly Formula."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a less visible but equally important use of the DPA continues through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known by its acronym CFIUS. This inter-agency body, authorized under Section 721 of the act, reviews foreign investments and real estate transactions that might affect national security.</p>

<p>CFIUS can investigate when foreign companies try to buy American businesses, particularly in sensitive sectors like technology, defense contracting, or critical infrastructure. The committee can impose conditions on transactions, require changes to deal structures, or recommend that the president block acquisitions entirely.</p>

<p>Civil penalties for violating CFIUS regulations can reach $250,000 per violation or the total value of the transaction, whichever is greater. For major deals, these fines can run into billions of dollars.</p>

<h2>The Evolving Meaning of Defense</h2>

<p>Looking at seventy-five years of the Defense Production Act reveals how dramatically the concept of "national defense" has expanded.</p>

<p>In 1950, the term meant weapons, ammunition, and military equipment—the physical tools of warfare. By 1970, it included space capabilities. By 1980, energy security. By 2003, critical infrastructure and radiation-hardened electronics. By the 2020s, pandemic preparedness, clean energy technology, and even baby formula had been swept under the national defense umbrella.</p>

<p>Each expansion followed a similar pattern. A crisis revealed a vulnerability in American society—military unpreparedness, energy dependence, supply chain fragility. Legislators and presidents responded by expanding the DPA's reach to address that vulnerability. The law accumulated layers of authority like geological strata, each representing a different moment of national anxiety.</p>

<p>Critics worry this expansion has gone too far, transforming emergency wartime powers into a general-purpose tool for industrial policy. Supporters argue that modern threats don't respect traditional categories—a pandemic can be as dangerous as an invasion, supply chain dependence as threatening as military weakness.</p>

<h2>The Permanent Emergency</h2>

<p>Here's the fundamental tension at the heart of the Defense Production Act: it was designed as temporary emergency legislation but has become a permanent feature of American governance.</p>

<p>The original law included provisions that today would seem shockingly authoritarian—seizing private property, fixing wages and prices, using force against striking workers. Congress wisely let those powers expire. But the core authorities remain, ready to be invoked whenever a president determines that national defense requires directing the private economy.</p>

<p>In practice, the DPA is now used routinely by the Department of Defense for priority contracting, without much public attention. The dramatic invocations—during COVID-19, the formula shortage, the clean energy push—make headlines, but the law's everyday operation goes largely unnoticed.</p>

<p>The law also raises questions about the relationship between government and business in a capitalist economy. The DPA essentially allows the government to conscript private companies for public purposes, overriding market mechanisms and property rights in the name of national security. How far should this power extend? Who gets to define what constitutes a national security threat?</p>

<p>There are no easy answers. The Defense Production Act reflects an uncomfortable truth: free markets work wonderfully for normal times, but emergencies sometimes require central coordination that markets can't provide. The challenge is ensuring that emergency powers don't become permanent ones, that the exception doesn't swallow the rule.</p>

<p>For now, the Defense Production Act remains what it has been for seventy-five years: a sleeping giant of executive authority, waiting for the next crisis to awaken it.</p>
