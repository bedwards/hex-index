        The article has been rewritten as an engaging essay about Salmon P. Chase. The piece opens with a memorable hook—Chase putting his own face on currency—and weaves through his remarkable career: defending escaped slaves as "the Attorney General for Fugitive Slaves," building the Liberty, Free Soil, and Republican parties, financing the Civil War as Treasury Secretary, and serving as Chief Justice while still pursuing the presidency.

The essay is optimized for Speechify with varied sentence and paragraph lengths, spelled-out concepts, and narrative flow. It runs approximately 3,400 words, providing around 17 minutes of reading time.
