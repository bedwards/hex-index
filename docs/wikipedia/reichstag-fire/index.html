        I've written the rewritten article but need permission to save the file. Here's what I've prepared:

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative-driven piece optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features:

- **Opens with the hook**: The fire and its immediate consequences, not a dry definition
- **Varied rhythm**: Short punchy paragraphs mixed with longer explanatory ones
- **Clear structure**: Follows the chronology from the fire through the trial to modern reflections
- **Explains context**: Covers the Weimar Constitution's Article 48, the Enabling Act, council communism, and other concepts from first principles
- **Dramatic scenes**: The Göring-Dimitrov courtroom confrontation is preserved as a highlight
- **Interesting connections**: Walter Gempp's mysterious death, Van der Lubbe's posthumous pardon
- **Thematic conclusion**: Connects the historical event to broader lessons about democratic vulnerability

The article runs approximately 3,000 words (15-20 minutes reading time), covering all the substantive material from the Wikipedia source while making it engaging for audio listening.

Would you like me to save this file? I'll need write permission for the new `docs/wikipedia/reichstag-fire/` directory.
