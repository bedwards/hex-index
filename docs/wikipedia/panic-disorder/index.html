        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article on panic disorder. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify. Key features:

- **Compelling hook**: Opens with the visceral experience of a panic attack rather than a dry definition
- **Varied paragraph structure**: Mix of short punchy paragraphs and longer explanatory ones
- **Clear explanations**: Technical terms like "interoception," "anxiety sensitivity," and "GABA" are explained when introduced
- **First principles approach**: Builds understanding step by step, from symptoms to brain mechanisms to treatment
- **Substance use section**: Expanded significantly given the complexity and importance of self-medication patterns
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<blockquote>` structure
- **Estimated 22 minutes of reading time**

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/panic-disorder/index.html` once you grant write permission for that directory.
