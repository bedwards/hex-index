        I've written the Guardian Angels essay as a rewrite of the Wikipedia article. The content transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about Valentine's Day 1979 rather than a dry definition
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms (CPR = cardiopulmonary resuscitation)
- Explains concepts from first principles without assuming prior knowledge
- Adds interesting context and connections
- Covers the organization's history, training, global expansion, controversies, and enduring appeal
- Runs approximately 2,200 words (~15 minute read)

However, I'm blocked from creating the file because the `docs/wikipedia/guardian-angels/` directory doesn't exist and I don't have permission to create it. To proceed, you'll need to either:

1. Create the directory: `mkdir -p docs/wikipedia/guardian-angels`
2. Grant me permission to write to that location

Would you like me to output the HTML content directly so you can save it yourself?
