        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article about Somaliland. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about Israel's 2025 recognition
- Explains the paradox of a functioning democracy that "doesn't exist" internationally
- Traces the history from the brief 1960 independence through the disastrous union with Somalia
- Covers the Barre regime's persecution and the Isaaq genocide
- Describes how Somaliland built democratic institutions from indigenous traditions
- Includes the ancient history (Punt, spice trade, sultanates)
- Addresses current geopolitics (UAE port investments, Red Sea strategy)
- Covers the Las Anod crisis and internal challenges
- Explains why international recognition matters practically

The content is ready to be saved to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/somaliland/index.html` - it needs write permission to create the new directory and file.
