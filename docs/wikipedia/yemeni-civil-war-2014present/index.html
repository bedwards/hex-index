        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Yemeni civil war. The file needs to be created at `docs/wikipedia/yemeni-civil-war/index.html`. Here's what I transformed:

**Key changes from encyclopedic to essay format:**
- Opened with the dramatic hook of Sanaa's fall rather than a dry definition
- Varied paragraph length throughout (some single-sentence punchy paragraphs, others longer)
- Spelled out all acronyms on first use (UAE, STC, AQAP, etc.)
- Explained Zaydi vs Twelver Shia distinctions from first principles
- Added narrative flow and transitions between sections
- Made the Iran-Saudi proxy war context clear without assuming prior knowledge
- Included the recent December 2025 STC offensive that connects to the Substack article

**Structure:**
1. The Day the Capital Fell (hook)
2. The Roots of Division (historical context)
3. The Rise of the Houthis (origins of the rebel movement)
4. Revolution and Collapse (Arab Spring to 2015)
5. Saudi Arabia Intervenes (coalition war begins)
6. The Shifting South (STC and fractured coalition)
7. The Human Cost (humanitarian crisis)
8. Failed Diplomacy and Fragile Truces (peace efforts)
9. The UAE's Southern Gambit (December 2025 offensive)
10. Why Yemen Matters (broader significance)

The article is approximately 22 minutes reading time and follows the same HTML template as the existing South Yemen Wikipedia article. Would you like me to try writing the file again, or would you prefer to create the directory and file manually?
