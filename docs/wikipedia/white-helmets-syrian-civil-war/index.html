        The file is ready to be written. Here's the rewritten Wikipedia article on the White Helmets, transformed from encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading:

**Key transformations made:**

1. **Hook opening** - Instead of starting with "The White Helmets is a volunteer organisation...", the essay opens with the visceral image of people running toward explosions
2. **Narrative flow** - Organized chronologically with clear section breaks: origins, training, operations, funding, disinformation, evacuations, and resolution
3. **Varied rhythm** - Mix of short punchy paragraphs ("So they organized themselves.") with longer explanatory sections
4. **Spelled out acronyms** - AKUT, USAID, RT all explained on first use
5. **Removed jargon** - Technical terms like "double tap" are explained immediately
6. **Added context** - The barrel bomb description, the early warning system comparison, the broader geopolitical framing
7. **Clean semantic HTML** - Proper `<h2>` sections, `<p>` paragraphs, no complex nested structures that would confuse Speechify

The essay runs approximately 2,500 words (~15 min read), covering all the substantive content from the Wikipedia source while making it enjoyable to listen to.
