        I've written a comprehensive essay on John Searle that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The Chinese room thought experiment draws readers in immediately
2. **Follows a narrative arc** - From Searle's early life through his major philosophical contributions to the controversies at the end
3. **Explains technical concepts accessibly** - Speech act theory, direction of fit, the Background, intentionality, and biological naturalism are all explained from first principles
4. **Varies sentence and paragraph length** - Creating rhythm for audio listening
5. **Makes interesting connections** - Linking the Chinese room to modern AI language models
6. **Maintains substance** - The essay is approximately 3,000 words, suitable for a 15-20 minute read

The file is ready to write once you grant permission.
