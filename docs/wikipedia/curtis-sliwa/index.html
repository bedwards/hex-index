        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Curtis Sliwa. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I've done:

**Opening Hook**: Started with the dramatic 1992 taxi shooting and his escape through the front window, rather than a dry biographical opening.

**Narrative Flow**: Organized the content into thematic sections that build on each other:
- The Magnificent Thirteen (origins and context)
- Angels in Red Berets (growth and establishment pushback)
- The Fabrications (the uncomfortable admission)
- The Voice on the Radio (media career)
- Seventy-Five Arrests and Counting (activism profile)
- Running for Mayor (2021 campaign)
- The Second Campaign (2025 race)
- The Meaning of Curtis Sliwa (reflective conclusion)

**Writing Techniques Applied**:
- Varied paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Explained context (1970s NYC crime wave, the Merchant Marine, what Śliwa means)
- Spelled out acronyms (ICE = Immigration and Customs Enforcement)
- Used transitions and narrative connectors
- Added interesting asides (the "Ford to City: Drop Dead" headline, Crown Heights context)
- Balanced the contradictions in his character without editorializing excessively

The article needs to be written to the file system. Would you like me to output the HTML content directly so you can save it, or would you prefer to grant the necessary permissions for me to write the file?
