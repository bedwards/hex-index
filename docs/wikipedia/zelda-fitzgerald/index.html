        I've written the essay about Zelda Fitzgerald. Here's the complete HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_Fitzgerald">Wikipedia: Zelda Fitzgerald</a></p>

<h2>The Fire That Took Everything</h2>

<p>On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire swept through Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. On the fifth floor, locked in her room and sedated, Zelda Fitzgerald could not escape. Her body was identified by her dental records and a single charred slipper. She was forty-seven years old.</p>

<p>Investigators later suspected arson—possibly the work of a disturbed hospital employee. But by then, Zelda had already burned through several lifetimes. She had been the golden girl of Montgomery, Alabama. The original American flapper. A novelist, painter, and playwright. The wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose name would eclipse hers for decades. And for more than ten years before her death, she had been a psychiatric patient, subjected to electroshock therapy and insulin shock treatments until her memory fractured into pieces.</p>

<p>The story of Zelda Fitzgerald is often told as a footnote to her husband's literary career. But that telling misses something essential. Zelda was not merely a muse. She was an artist whose work was overshadowed, a woman whose ambitions collided with the expectations of her era, and a mind that the medicine of her time could not understand.</p>

<h2>A Daughter of the Confederacy</h2>

<p>Zelda Sayre was born on July 24, 1900, in Montgomery, Alabama—the youngest of six children in a family that embodied the dying mythology of the Old South.</p>

<p>Her pedigree was impeccable by the standards of the former Confederacy. Her maternal grandfather, Willis Benson Machen, had served as a Confederate Senator. Her father's uncle, John Tyler Morgan, had been a Confederate general and later the second Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. Morgan served six terms in the United States Senate and was an outspoken advocate of lynching. The Sayre family had built the home that Jefferson Davis used as the first White House of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>This was the world that shaped Zelda. According to biographer Sally Cline, "in Zelda's girlhood, ghosts of the late Confederacy drifted through the sleepy oak-lined streets." Zelda herself claimed to draw strength from Montgomery's Confederate past.</p>

<p>Her father, Anthony Dickinson Sayre, was a state legislator who authored the 1893 Sayre Act—a law that systematically stripped African Americans of voting rights and ushered in seventy years of Jim Crow segregation in Alabama. Zelda described him as a "living fortress," a man strict and emotionally remote. Some scholars have speculated, based on her later writings, that Anthony Sayre may have sexually abused his daughter, though no evidence confirms this.</p>

<p>Her mother, Minerva, was the opposite—doting, indulgent, unwilling to deny her youngest child anything. The name "Zelda" came from a Romani heroine in a nineteenth-century novel, either Jane Howard's "Zelda: A Tale of the Massachusetts Colony" or Robert Edward Francillon's "Zelda's Fortune." It was an unusual choice, romantic and exotic, perhaps foretelling the kind of woman the child would become.</p>

<h2>The Belle Who Refused to Be Docile</h2>

<p>Growing up in the Sayre household meant growing up wealthy. Half a dozen servants, many of them African American, handled domestic work. Zelda never learned to cook, clean, or care for herself in practical ways. Her days were filled with ballet lessons, swimming, and the outdoors. Summers were spent in Saluda, a mountain village in North Carolina that would appear in her paintings decades later.</p>

<p>At Sidney Lanier High School, Zelda proved herself bright but utterly uninterested in academics. What she cared about was attention. She drank gin. She smoked cigarettes. She flirted with every boy who crossed her path. When a newspaper quoted her about a dance performance, she said she cared only about "boys and swimming."</p>

<p>She wore a flesh-colored bathing suit tight enough to spark rumors that she swam nude. She flouted every convention that Southern society expected of its young women. The code of the time demanded delicacy and docility. Zelda offered neither.</p>

<p>Her father's reputation protected her from complete social ruin. But she became a fixture of Montgomery gossip, alongside her childhood friend Tallulah Bankhead, who would later become a Hollywood star. Beneath Zelda's senior yearbook photo appeared the quote she had chosen: "Why should all life be work, when we all can borrow? Let's think only of today, and not worry about tomorrow."</p>

<p>Her classmates voted her "prettiest" and "most attractive." They were not wrong.</p>

<h2>The Lieutenant Who Wanted to Be Famous</h2>

<p>In July 1918, a young Army lieutenant named F. Scott Fitzgerald met Zelda Sayre at the Montgomery Country Club. He was stationed at Camp Sheridan, waiting to be shipped to the Western Front of World War I. He was also nursing a broken heart.</p>

<p>Just months earlier, Scott had been rejected by Ginevra King, a wealthy Chicago socialite and heiress. Her family considered him insufficiently rich and well-connected. The rejection had devastated him. He had dropped out of Princeton University and enlisted in the Army, perhaps hoping that war would provide either glory or oblivion.</p>

<p>Zelda reminded him of Ginevra. He began calling her daily, visiting Montgomery on his free days, and talking incessantly about his ambitions. He was going to be a famous novelist, he told her. He was writing a book. He sent her a chapter.</p>

<p>Zelda was skeptical. She had heard plenty of boasting from plenty of young men. She concluded that this particular young man would never amount to anything.</p>

<p>But Scott was smitten. He rewrote the character of Rosalind Connage in his manuscript "The Romantic Egotist" to resemble Zelda, telling her that "the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four." He copied passages directly from her letters into his fiction. One letter in particular struck him—Zelda's meditation on walking through a Confederate cemetery, thinking about the dead soldiers buried there.</p>

<p>"I've spent today in the graveyard," she had written. "Isn't it funny how, out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers and dead loves—when they're exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss."</p>

<p>Scott used this almost verbatim in his novel, though he changed the Confederate dead to Union soldiers. When they walked through the cemetery together and Scott failed to show proper reverence, Zelda told him flatly that he would never understand how she felt about those graves.</p>

<h2>A Love Built on Desperation</h2>

<p>Three days after Ginevra King married a polo player named William Mitchell in September 1918, Scott declared his love for Zelda. In his personal ledger, he recorded that he had fallen in love on September 7.</p>

<p>The timing tells us something important. Scott's feelings for Zelda were entangled with his feelings about Ginevra, about rejection, about proving himself worthy of the kind of woman who might otherwise dismiss him. He wrote to a friend: "I love her and that's the beginning and end of everything. You're still a Catholic, but Zelda's the only God I have left now."</p>

<p>Zelda eventually fell in love too. Her biographer Nancy Milford observed that Scott had "appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own."</p>

<p>Their courtship intensified when Scott was summoned north in October, expecting deployment to France. Instead, the armistice with Germany was signed while he was stationed at Camp Mills on Long Island. He returned to Montgomery, and by December 1918, he and Zelda had consummated their relationship—what Scott later called their "sexual recklessness."</p>

<p>Neither was inexperienced. Both had previous partners. But now they considered themselves informally engaged, with one crucial condition: Zelda would not marry Scott until he proved he could support her in the style to which she was accustomed.</p>

<h2>The Pregnancy Scare and the Broken Engagement</h2>

<p>In February 1919, Scott was discharged from the Army and headed to New York City to make his fortune. Zelda mistakenly believed she was pregnant. Scott mailed her pills to induce an abortion.</p>

<p>Zelda's response was fierce. "I simply can't and won't take those awful pills," she wrote back. "I'd rather have a whole family than sacrifice my self-respect.... I'd feel like a damn whore if I took even one."</p>

<p>The pregnancy scare proved to be a false alarm. But Scott's literary career was not progressing as planned. Month after month, his attempts to get published failed. By the summer of 1919, Zelda had lost faith. She broke off the engagement.</p>

<p>This was the summer that would later be called the Red Summer—a period of horrific racial violence across America, when white mobs attacked Black communities in cities from Chicago to Washington. In Montgomery, Zelda Sayre, descendant of Confederate aristocracy and architects of Jim Crow, ended her relationship with a failed Yankee writer who could not provide the life she expected.</p>

<p>Scott was devastated. Having now been rejected by both Ginevra and Zelda, he fell into despair. He carried a revolver and contemplated suicide.</p>

<h2>The Gamble That Paid Off</h2>

<p>Scott retreated to his parents' home in St. Paul, Minnesota, living as a recluse on the top floor of their house on Summit Avenue. He decided to stake everything on one final attempt to become a novelist.</p>

<p>He stopped drinking. He stopped going to parties. He worked day and night to revise "The Romantic Egotist" into a new novel called "This Side of Paradise"—an autobiographical account of his Princeton years and his romances with Ginevra, Zelda, and others.</p>

<p>His feelings for Zelda had soured. He told a friend: "I wouldn't care if she died, but I couldn't stand to have anybody else marry her."</p>

<p>By September 1919, the novel was complete. Maxwell Perkins, an editor at Charles Scribner's Sons, accepted it for publication. Scott begged for an accelerated release. "I have so many things dependent on its success," he wrote, "including of course a girl."</p>

<p>When Zelda learned that Scribner's would publish the book, she was shocked and apologetic. "I hate to say this, but I don't think I had much confidence in you at first," she admitted. "It's so nice to know you really can do things—anything—and I love to feel that maybe I can help just a little."</p>

<p>She agreed to marry him once the novel was out. Scott promised to bring her to New York with "all the iridescence of the beginning of the world."</p>

<h2>Fame, Fortune, and Disappointment</h2>

<p>Scribner's published "This Side of Paradise" on March 26, 1920. It was an immediate sensation. Zelda arrived in New York four days later. On April 3, they married in a small ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>

<p>But something had already died between them.</p>

<p>Years later, Scott would admit that by the time of their wedding, neither he nor Zelda still truly loved each other. The thrill of their first romance had faded during the months of separation and rejection. Biographer Andrew Turnbull observed that "victory was sweet, though not as sweet as it would have been six months earlier before Zelda had rejected him. Fitzgerald couldn't recapture the thrill of their first love."</p>

<p>Even worse, Scott never stopped loving Ginevra King. For the rest of his marriage to Zelda, he could not think of Ginevra "without tears coming to his eyes."</p>

<p>Yet if their private love had cooled, their public image blazed. Scott and Zelda became the most famous young couple in New York, celebrated as much for their outrageous behavior as for his literary success. They were kicked out of the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for disturbing other guests. They jumped into the fountain at the Plaza Hotel while fully dressed. They rode on the hoods of taxicabs. One evening, while drunk, they visited the county morgue to inspect unidentified corpses.</p>

<p>The newspapers called them the enfants terribles of the Jazz Age—the terrible children, wild and glamorous and utterly irresponsible. Zelda, with her beauty and her disregard for convention, was christened the first American flapper.</p>

<h2>The Artist in the Shadow</h2>

<p>The marriage was troubled from the start. Allegations of infidelity and bitter recriminations accumulated. When Zelda traveled to Europe, her mental health began to deteriorate. She experienced suicidal and homicidal impulses that required psychiatric care.</p>

<p>Her doctors diagnosed her with schizophrenia. Modern scholars, reviewing the evidence posthumously, believe she more likely suffered from bipolar disorder—a condition that the medicine of her era could not properly identify or treat.</p>

<p>While institutionalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore in 1932, Zelda wrote a novel. She called it "Save Me the Waltz."</p>

<p>The book was semi-autobiographical, drawing on her childhood in the Jim Crow South and her tumultuous marriage to Scott. It was a risky artistic move. Scott was also writing about their marriage, in what would become "Tender Is the Night." He was furious that Zelda had used their shared material.</p>

<p>Scribner's published "Save Me the Waltz" in 1932. The reviews were mostly negative. Sales were poor. The failure devastated Zelda.</p>

<p>She turned to playwriting, completing a stage drama called "Scandalabra" in the fall of 1932. Broadway producers unanimously declined to produce it.</p>

<p>She tried painting watercolors. When Scott arranged an exhibition of her work in 1934, the critical response was equally disappointing.</p>

<p>Everything she attempted seemed to fail. Her husband's literary reputation, meanwhile, continued to overshadow her own efforts—even as his personal life disintegrated alongside hers.</p>

<h2>The Long Decline</h2>

<p>By the late 1930s, Scott and Zelda were living apart. He was in Hollywood, trying to make money as a screenwriter, drinking himself to death. She was in and out of psychiatric institutions, undergoing treatments that we would now consider barbaric.</p>

<p>Electroshock therapy. Insulin shock treatments. Year after year, session after session, her memory eroded. The woman who had written a novel and painted watercolors and danced ballet found herself struggling to remember her own past.</p>

<p>Scott died on December 21, 1940, of occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis—a heart attack brought on by years of alcoholism. He was forty-four years old.</p>

<p>Zelda outlived him by seven years. She tried to write a second novel, "Caesar's Things," but her recurring hospitalizations interrupted the work. She never completed it.</p>

<p>On that night in March 1948, when fire consumed Highland Hospital, Zelda was locked in her room on the fifth floor, sedated and helpless. The flames took her, as they had taken so much else.</p>

<h2>Rediscovery</h2>

<p>For decades after her death, Zelda Fitzgerald was remembered primarily as Scott's wife—a beautiful, troubled woman who had inspired his characters and contributed to his downfall. Her own artistic work was largely forgotten.</p>

<p>That changed in 1970, when Nancy Milford published a biography simply titled "Zelda." The book was a finalist for the National Book Award and sparked a fundamental reassessment of Zelda's life and legacy.</p>

<p>Scholars began examining "Save Me the Waltz" with fresh eyes. They explored how Zelda's depiction of their marriage contrasted with Scott's version in "Tender Is the Night." They analyzed how the consumer culture of the 1920s placed unique mental stresses on modern women. They asked questions that earlier critics had never thought to ask: What would Zelda's career have looked like if she hadn't been married to F. Scott Fitzgerald? What if her husband hadn't seen her as a rival rather than a fellow artist?</p>

<p>Renewed interest also emerged in Zelda's paintings. Her watercolors, once dismissed by contemporary critics, were exhibited posthumously in the United States and Europe. People began to see what had always been there—a genuine artistic vision, distinct from her husband's, struggling to express itself under impossible circumstances.</p>

<p>In 1992, Zelda Fitzgerald was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame. The honor came forty-four years after her death, and more than seven decades after she had been the most famous young woman in America.</p>

<h2>The Question That Remains</h2>

<p>Zelda Fitzgerald's story raises uncomfortable questions about genius, gender, and the cost of living in someone else's shadow.</p>

<p>She was born into a family that had built its wealth and power on slavery and segregation. She grew up believing she was entitled to attention and admiration. She married a man who saw her as both muse and competitor, who borrowed from her letters for his fiction and then resented her for writing fiction of her own.</p>

<p>Was she a great artist whose potential was crushed by circumstance? Or was she a talented amateur whose work has been inflated by feminist scholars eager to find a victim narrative? The honest answer is that we cannot know. We cannot separate Zelda from Scott, cannot untangle her authentic voice from the noise of their marriage, cannot determine what she might have become if her mind had not betrayed her.</p>

<p>What we can say is this: she tried. She wrote a novel while locked in a psychiatric hospital. She painted watercolors while undergoing treatments that destroyed her memory. She kept creating even when every creation met with failure and dismissal.</p>

<p>The fire that killed her in 1948 was not the first fire in her life. She had been burning since Montgomery, since the country club where she met a young lieutenant who wanted to be famous, since the first moment she decided that the rules governing Southern women did not apply to her.</p>

<p>She burned, and she was burned. And the ash that remained tells us something about the price of being extraordinary in a world that preferred her to be merely ornamental.</p>
```

The essay is approximately 3,200 words (roughly 16 minutes of reading). It opens with the dramatic ending—her death in the hospital fire—then traces her story from her Confederate aristocracy roots through her marriage to Scott Fitzgerald, her own artistic struggles, and her posthumous rediscovery. The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for good audio flow with Speechify, avoids jargon, and weaves in the historical context of Jim Crow, the Jazz Age, and early psychiatric treatment.
