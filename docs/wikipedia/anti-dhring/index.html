<h2>The Book That Built Marxism</h2>

<p>In 1878, Friedrich Engels published what would become the most influential book that almost no one today has heard of. It was written to destroy a man, and it did—but along the way, it accidentally created something far more enduring: the systematic philosophy of Marxism as we know it.</p>

<p>The target was Eugen Dühring, a blind lecturer at the University of Berlin whose ideas were threatening to capture the German socialist movement. The weapon was a sprawling, combative work called "Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science"—which everyone quickly shortened to "Anti-Dühring."</p>

<p>Here's the strange part: Engels didn't want to write it. He thought attacking a blind man was bad optics. But Dühring had been calling Marx a "scientific figure of fun" and dismissing Engels as a "Siamese twin" whose only qualification for criticizing capitalism was being a factory owner himself. Eventually, what Engels called "the chap's colossal arrogance" became impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>What started as an ideological takedown became something else entirely. Engels used the project to lay out, for the first time in accessible language, a complete picture of Marxist thought—covering philosophy, economics, and political strategy in one coherent system. It was, in effect, the first Marxist textbook.</p>

<h2>Who Was Eugen Dühring?</h2>

<p>To understand why Engels spent years of his life dismantling Dühring's ideas, you need to understand the moment. The German socialist movement was at a crossroads.</p>

<p>In 1875, two rival socialist factions had merged to form the Social Democratic Party of Germany, known by its German initials SPD. This new party needed intellectual foundations, and Dühring was positioning himself as the man to provide them. His version of socialism rejected Marx's emphasis on economic determinism—the idea that economic forces ultimately drive historical change. Instead, Dühring proposed a more gradualist approach focused on immediate material gains for workers: better wages, shorter hours, practical victories.</p>

<p>This was appealing. Marx's philosophy, with its Hegelian dialectics and dense economic analysis, struck many German socialists as arcane and unrealizable. Dühring offered something simpler. His "force theory" emphasized strikes, collective action, and the creation of autonomous worker communes as the path forward. Why wait for the contradictions of capitalism to resolve themselves when you could just organize and fight?</p>

<p>Even Eduard Bernstein, who would later become one of the most important socialist theorists in his own right, found Dühring's approach more practical than Marx's abstractions. For a time, Dühring was regarded as one of the SPD's chief theorists.</p>

<p>Engels and Marx saw danger. They considered Dühring's ideas a form of "petty-bourgeois socialism"—a watered-down version that would ultimately serve the interests of the middle class rather than the working class. If Dühring's influence continued to grow, it might derail the proletarian movement entirely.</p>

<h2>A Tedious But Necessary Knockabout</h2>

<p>Engels called the project a "tedious but necessary ideological knockabout." He was in the middle of writing another book, "Dialectics of Nature," which he never finished. But Wilhelm Liebknecht, one of the SPD's founders, kept urging him to respond to Dühring's growing influence. Eventually, Engels relented.</p>

<p>The full title was itself a piece of intellectual combat. Dühring had written lavishly praising the American economist Henry Charles Carey, and Engels's title—"Herr Eugen Dühring's Revolution in Science"—was an "ironically inverted parody" of that praise. The message was clear: Dühring thought he was revolutionizing science, but Engels was about to demonstrate otherwise.</p>

<p>The book was serialized in Vorwärts, a socialist newspaper, between 1877 and 1878, then published as a complete volume in Leipzig in 1878. It runs to several hundred pages and covers an enormous range of topics, but its structure is straightforward: three sections addressing philosophy, political economy, and socialism.</p>

<p>What makes it remarkable is how Engels transformed a polemical attack into a systematic exposition. He wasn't just refuting Dühring point by point; he was explaining what Marxism actually believed and why. For many readers, this was their first encounter with these ideas in any coherent form.</p>

<h2>The Three Laws of Dialectics</h2>

<p>The philosophical section of Anti-Dühring introduced concepts that would define Marxist thought for the next century. Chief among them was dialectical materialism—a term that Engels did more than anyone to establish.</p>

<p>To understand what this means, you need to understand what it was arguing against. The dominant mode of philosophical thinking in the nineteenth century was what Engels called "metaphysical"—a way of seeing the world in fixed, isolated categories. Things simply were what they were. A tree was a tree. A class was a class. Change happened, but categories remained stable.</p>

<p>Dialectical thinking, which Engels traced back to ancient Greek philosophers and especially to the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, saw things differently. In this view, everything exists in motion, in connection, in contradiction. A tree is not just a tree but a process—a seed becoming a sapling becoming a trunk becoming deadwood becoming soil. Categories themselves evolve and transform.</p>

<p>Hegel had applied dialectical thinking to ideas, to the realm of thought. Engels's innovation—or what he claimed as an innovation—was to argue that dialectics applied equally to the material world. The laws governing the development of ideas were the same laws governing nature and history. As Engels put it, "the dialectics of the mind is only the reflection of the forms of motion of the real world."</p>

<p>He outlined three fundamental laws:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The transformation of quantity into quality.</strong> Small, gradual changes accumulate until they produce a sudden qualitative shift. Water gets warmer by degrees, and then suddenly it becomes steam.</li>
<li><strong>The interpenetration of opposites.</strong> Contradictions don't just coexist; they define and constitute each other. You cannot understand "worker" without "capitalist," or "buyer" without "seller."</li>
<li><strong>The negation of the negation.</strong> Development proceeds through contradiction—a thesis generates its antithesis, and their conflict produces a synthesis that preserves elements of both while transcending them. This synthesis then becomes a new thesis, generating further development.</li>
</ul>

<p>These laws, Engels argued, could explain not just social and historical change but also developments in biology, chemistry, and physics. He was deeply influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which he saw as a scientific confirmation of dialectical principles—life developing through variation, competition, and transformation.</p>

<p>Engels also made a bold prediction about the fate of philosophy itself. As the natural sciences developed their own general laws, he argued, traditional philosophy would become obsolete. All that would remain of "all former philosophy" was "the science of thought and its laws—formal logic and dialectics." Everything else would be absorbed by empirical science.</p>

<h2>Economics Made Simple</h2>

<p>The second section of Anti-Dühring tackled political economy, essentially offering a summary of Marx's masterwork "Das Kapital" for readers who might never wade through that dense tome.</p>

<p>The core concept was surplus value. In a capitalist system, workers sell their labor power to factory owners. They work a certain number of hours, producing goods. But the wages they receive don't equal the full value of what they produce—if they did, the factory owner would make no profit. The difference between what workers create and what they're paid is surplus value, and it's the source of all capitalist profit.</p>

<p>This wasn't just exploitation in a moral sense, Engels argued. It was a structural feature of capitalism, built into the system's basic mechanics. No amount of good intentions or enlightened management could eliminate it. It arose from the fundamental relationship between those who owned the means of production and those who had only their labor to sell.</p>

<p>Engels also explained what he and Marx called the materialist conception of history. This was the idea that the economic base of society—who owns what, how production is organized, how goods are exchanged—ultimately determines everything else: political structures, legal systems, religious beliefs, cultural values. These superstructural elements might seem independent, floating free from material concerns, but they were in fact shaped by underlying economic relations.</p>

<p>All of history, in this view, was the history of class struggles. Different classes, defined by their relationship to the means of production, had opposing interests, and their conflicts drove historical change. Slave-owners versus slaves, feudal lords versus serfs, capitalists versus workers—the specific actors changed, but the underlying dynamic remained.</p>

<h2>From Utopia to Science</h2>

<p>The final section of Anti-Dühring addressed socialism itself, and here Engels made a distinction that would prove enormously influential: the difference between utopian socialism and scientific socialism.</p>

<p>The utopian socialists—figures like Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen—had offered important critiques of capitalist society. They saw its injustices clearly. But their proposed solutions, Engels argued, were "pure phantasies." They imagined ideal communities and hoped to persuade people to adopt them through reason and example. They had no theory of how socialism would actually come about, no understanding of the historical forces that might make it possible.</p>

<p>Scientific socialism, by contrast, was grounded in the materialist analysis of history. It didn't dream up perfect societies; it studied the contradictions within existing society and traced where they led. The core contradiction of capitalism, Engels argued, was between the socialized nature of production—thousands of workers coordinating in factories, their labor interdependent—and the private appropriation of its products. Wealth was created collectively but owned individually.</p>

<p>This contradiction, Engels claimed, would inevitably lead to crisis and revolution. The proletariat would seize political power and transform the means of production into public property. This would resolve the fundamental contradiction at the heart of capitalism.</p>

<p>And then something remarkable would happen. The state—that apparatus of coercion and control—would no longer be necessary. In one of Anti-Dühring's most famous formulations, Engels wrote: "The state is not 'abolished.' It withers away." As class distinctions disappeared and the need to enforce them vanished, the machinery of state power would gradually become superfluous, a relic of a divided past.</p>

<p>This process, Engels declared, would mark "the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom."</p>

<h2>A Bestseller by Accident</h2>

<p>Anti-Dühring achieved its immediate goal: Dühring's influence within the German socialist movement collapsed. But its lasting impact went far beyond intellectual combat.</p>

<p>The book became, in effect, the textbook of Marxism. For an entire generation of European socialists, it was the primary text through which they encountered these ideas. August Bebel, one of the founders of German social democracy, was deeply influenced by it. So was Georgi Plekhanov, who brought Marxism to Russia. So were Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky, who became leading theorists of the Second International.</p>

<p>Karl Kautsky later recalled: "It was only through Anti-Dühring that we learnt to understand Capital and read it properly." The book served as a guide to Marx's more difficult work, making it accessible and comprehensible.</p>

<p>David Riazanov, a Soviet scholar who would later become the first director of the Marx-Engels Institute in Moscow, called it "epoch-making in the history of Marxism." The younger generation, he wrote, learned from it "what was scientific socialism, what were its philosophic premises, what was its method."</p>

<p>An even more accessible version emerged in 1880. At the request of Paul Lafargue, Marx's son-in-law, Engels adapted a section of the book into a standalone pamphlet called "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific." This became Engels's bestseller. By 1892, he noted that it had been translated into ten languages.</p>

<p>The historian Terrell Carver called this pamphlet "the Communist Manifesto of its time, but arguably even more influential"—"the work from which millions of conversions to Marxism were made."</p>

<h2>The Engels Problem</h2>

<p>In the twentieth century, Anti-Dühring's legacy became controversial. A tradition of criticism emerged, beginning with the Hungarian philosopher Georg Lukács and continuing through Western Marxists like Stanisław Brzozowski and Jean-Paul Sartre, that accused Engels of distorting Marx's thought.</p>

<p>The core accusation was that Engels had created a rigid, scientistic dogma by extending Marx's dialectical method to the natural world. Marx himself, these critics argued, had focused on human history and social relations. He was interested in how people made their world through labor and struggle. Engels, by contrast, tried to discover laws that governed everything—not just society but nature itself, from the formation of galaxies to the development of organisms.</p>

<p>This extension, the critics claimed, transformed Marxism from a critical method into a totalizing system, a closed doctrine with answers for everything. And this systematization, they argued, laid the groundwork for the rigid ideology of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski identified four key points where he believed Engels diverged from Marx. First, Engels replaced Marx's focus on human beings and their activity with a naturalistic evolutionism that treated humanity as just another part of nature. Second, he shifted from Marx's emphasis on praxis—practical, transformative activity—to a more technical interpretation of knowledge as simply reflecting external reality. Third, Engels suggested philosophy would be superseded by science, whereas Marx had envisioned philosophy merging with life as a whole. Fourth, Engels emphasized infinite historical progression, while Marx had a more eschatological vision of revolutionary transformation.</p>

<p>The American scholar Norman Levine went further, arguing that Engels was "the first revisionist" of Marx and that "Engelsism"—a deterministic, positivist approach focused on technology as the driver of history—laid the foundation for Soviet dogmatism. Joseph Stalin's chapter on "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" in the infamous Short Course of 1938, which became required reading throughout the Soviet sphere, drew heavily on Engels's formulations from Anti-Dühring.</p>

<h2>In Defense of Engels</h2>

<p>But this interpretation has its critics too.</p>

<p>Engels's biographers point out an inconvenient fact: Marx was deeply involved in the creation of Anti-Dühring. He was the "prime mover" behind the project, encouraging Engels to write it. He had the entire manuscript read to him before publication. He contributed a section on economics. And he recommended it as an important text for understanding German socialism.</p>

<p>If Anti-Dühring distorted Marx's thought, Marx himself apparently didn't notice.</p>

<p>The historian Tristram Hunt argues that both Marx and Engels had been energized by the scientific progress of their day—Darwin's evolution, advances in chemistry and physics—and that Anti-Dühring represented "an expression of authentic, mature Marxist opinion." It wasn't a deviation; it was what they both believed.</p>

<p>Terrell Carver notes that Marx's own writings show clear interest in science and in applying dialectical thinking to both nature and society. The grand theoretical system of Anti-Dühring, he suggests, was an authentic expression of their joint outlook, not Engels going rogue.</p>

<p>The historian S.H. Rigby argues that the supposed distinctions between Marx and Engels are often overstated. Marx's own writings, he points out, contain "vulgar materialist and positivist claims" similar to those for which Engels is criticized. The attempt to make Engels a "scapegoat for the views which Marx himself quite explicitly formulated," Rigby concludes, is unconvincing.</p>

<h2>The Book That Won</h2>

<p>Whatever its philosophical merits or demerits, Anti-Dühring achieved something remarkable. It took a set of ideas that had been scattered across dense treatises, private correspondence, and unpublished manuscripts and forged them into a coherent system that millions of people could understand and act upon.</p>

<p>Whether that system was true to Marx's vision—whether it captured something essential or reduced something complex to a formula—remains debated. But its influence is undeniable. For better or worse, when people in the twentieth century talked about Marxism, they were usually talking about the version Engels codified in this book.</p>

<p>Dühring, meanwhile, faded into obscurity. He continued lecturing and writing, but his moment had passed. Today he is remembered almost exclusively as the man Engels wrote a book against—his name immortalized only in the title of his own destruction.</p>

<p>There's a certain irony in that. Engels didn't want to write the book. He thought it was a distraction from more important work. But it became the most widely read thing he ever produced, the foundation of a global movement, and—for his critics—the source of everything that went wrong with Marxism in the century that followed.</p>

<p>Some tedious knockabouts, it turns out, change history.</p>
