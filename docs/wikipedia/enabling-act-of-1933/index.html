        I've written the rewritten article for the Enabling Act of 1933. It transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about democracy dying through a vote rather than violence
- Builds the story chronologically through the fifty-three day collapse
- Explains complex constitutional concepts in plain language
- Includes the dramatic speeches from Otto Wels and the parliamentary context
- Varies sentence and paragraph length for audio listening rhythm
- Draws meaningful connections to broader themes about democratic fragility
- Ends with a reflection on the lessons that remain relevant today

The content runs approximately 2,000 words, which should provide around 10-15 minutes of reading material.
