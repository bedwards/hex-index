<p>In 1518, in the city of Strasbourg, a woman named Frau Troffea stepped into the street and began to dance. She danced for days. Within a month, four hundred people had joined her, many dancing until they collapsed from exhaustion, strokes, or heart attacks. No music was playing. No celebration was occurring. They simply could not stop.</p>

<p>This was the dancing plague of 1518, one of history's most dramatic examples of what we now call mass psychogenic illness—a phenomenon where real physical symptoms spread through a group of people without any virus, bacteria, toxin, or other biological cause. The illness is genuine. The suffering is real. But the contagion is psychological.</p>

<h2>When the Body Believes</h2>

<p>Mass psychogenic illness, sometimes called mass hysteria or epidemic hysteria, occurs when physical symptoms ripple through a connected group of people in the absence of any infectious agent. These aren't people pretending to be sick. Their bodies genuinely manifest symptoms: nausea, dizziness, fainting, rashes, seizures, uncontrollable movements, or fits of laughter or screaming. Blood tests come back normal. Environmental samples reveal nothing. Yet the suffering continues.</p>

<p>The symptoms share certain characteristics. They tend to appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly. They have no plausible organic explanation that doctors can identify. They spread through groups that share some connection—students at the same school, workers at the same factory, nuns in the same convent. And critically, they spread through sight, sound, and word of mouth. Seeing someone collapse makes you more likely to collapse yourself.</p>

<p>There's a pattern to how these outbreaks move through populations. They typically begin with older or higher-status individuals and then cascade downward. In schools, the oldest students fall ill first, then the younger ones follow. The epidemic travels along social networks, affecting people who know each other, who talk to each other, who see each other every day.</p>

<h2>Two Flavors of Collective Crisis</h2>

<p>British psychiatrist Simon Wessely identified two distinct patterns in how mass psychogenic illness manifests.</p>

<p>The first he called mass anxiety hysteria. This variety explodes rapidly, typically among schoolchildren, with acute anxiety as its engine. There's no buildup of tension beforehand—it simply detonates. Students see a classmate faint or hyperventilate, and within hours, dozens are experiencing the same symptoms. These outbreaks tend to resolve quickly once authorities intervene to calm the situation.</p>

<p>The second pattern, mass motor hysteria, moves more slowly but digs in deeper. This version involves abnormal physical movements—tremors, convulsions, strange gaits, or repetitive behaviors. Unlike anxiety hysteria, motor hysteria grows from a foundation of sustained psychological tension. It can simmer for months, gradually pulling more people into its orbit. These outbreaks prove far more stubborn to extinguish.</p>

<p>Not all researchers accept this tidy division. Many documented outbreaks blend characteristics of both types, suggesting the underlying mechanisms may be more complex than any simple categorization can capture.</p>

<h2>The Medieval Dance Epidemics</h2>

<p>The dancing manias that swept through Europe during the Middle Ages remain the most spectacular recorded instances of mass psychogenic illness. They went by different names in different places—St. John's dance in Germany, tarantism in Italy—and people at the time attributed them to demonic possession or, in the Italian cases, to the bite of the tarantula spider.</p>

<p>The dancers moved in enormous groups, sometimes hundreds or thousands strong. They would dance for days or even weeks without rest. Contemporary accounts describe them howling, stripping off their clothes, making obscene gestures, and laughing or crying so violently that some reportedly died from sheer exhaustion. The phenomenon appeared repeatedly across Europe for centuries.</p>

<p>What could drive people to dance themselves to death? Historians have proposed various explanations: ergot poisoning from contaminated grain, which can cause hallucinations and convulsions; religious fervor in an age of apocalyptic anxiety; or simply the accumulated stress of lives marked by famine, plague, and war. The truth is we may never know for certain. But the pattern—physical symptoms spreading through communities without any identifiable pathogen—matches what we see in modern outbreaks.</p>

<h2>The Meowing Nuns and Other Convent Crises</h2>

<p>Between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries, convents across Europe experienced repeated outbreaks of what authorities at the time called demonic possession. Young women confined within these institutions would suddenly begin exhibiting bizarre behaviors: speaking in tongues, making crude sexual gestures, screaming blasphemies, or contorting their bodies into impossible positions.</p>

<p>One particularly strange incident, recorded in a French medical journal and noted by the eighteenth-century epidemiologist Benjamin Guy Babington, described a convent where the nuns collectively began meowing like cats. They would meow in unison for hours each day, continuing day after day, until authorities finally resorted to having them beaten with rods to stop the behavior.</p>

<p>The conditions that produced these outbreaks were remarkably consistent. These convents housed young women who often had not chosen religious life voluntarily—they had been placed there by their families. Once inside, they took vows of perpetual chastity and poverty. Their days followed rigid schedules enforced through strict discipline. They had little autonomy, few outlets for normal emotional expression, and no escape.</p>

<p>Priests were regularly summoned to perform exorcisms, treating the symptoms as evidence of supernatural invasion rather than psychological distress. The exorcisms, with their intense emotional drama and focused attention on the afflicted, may well have made the outbreaks worse rather than better.</p>

<h2>The Factory Epidemics</h2>

<p>The Industrial Revolution brought mass psychogenic illness into the modern workplace. Factories in England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the United States, and Singapore all documented outbreaks among their workers—typically young women laboring under stressful conditions.</p>

<p>Singapore provides particularly well-documented cases. Between 1973 and 1978, W. H. Phoon of Singapore's Ministry of Labour recorded six separate outbreaks in factories across the country. The symptoms fell into recognizable patterns: hysterical seizures involving screaming and violent movements that even tranquilizers could not calm; trance states where workers claimed to be possessed by spirits or djinn; and episodes of overwhelming fear accompanied by numbness, coldness, or dizziness.</p>

<p>In these Singaporean cases, factory managers often called in a bomoh—a traditional medicine man—to perform ritual exorcisms. The strategy backfired. Rather than calming the situation, the ceremonies seemed to validate the spiritual explanation and prolong the outbreaks.</p>

<p>The most extensively studied factory outbreak occurred in June 1962 at a dressmaking plant in the American South. Sixty-two workers suddenly developed severe nausea and skin rashes. Many believed they had been bitten by insects that arrived with a fabric shipment. Entomologists investigated but found no insects. Environmental scientists tested the air and water and found nothing. Yet the symptoms persisted.</p>

<p>When researchers interviewed both affected and unaffected workers, clear patterns emerged. Those who fell ill were more likely to work frequent overtime and to be their family's primary breadwinner. They tended to be married women with children, carrying heavy responsibilities both at work and at home. And they showed a tendency to deny or minimize their difficulties—a trait the researchers suggested made them less equipped to cope with accumulated stress.</p>

<p>Most tellingly, the illness followed social networks. People who knew each other, who talked regularly, who were friends—these groups got sick together while isolated workers remained healthy.</p>

<h2>The Tanganyika Laughter Epidemic</h2>

<p>In 1962, something extraordinary happened near the village of Kanshasa on the western shore of Lake Victoria in what is now Tanzania. A few students at a girls' boarding school began laughing. The laughter spread. Soon the entire school was incapacitated by uncontrollable fits of laughter that could last for hours or even days.</p>

<p>The school had to close. But the epidemic didn't end—it followed the students home to their villages, where it infected family members and neighbors. Eventually, fourteen different schools were forced to shut down as the laughter spread through the region. More than a thousand people were affected before the epidemic finally burned itself out.</p>

<p>The Tanganyika laughter epidemic remains one of the purest examples of mass psychogenic illness on record. No pathogen. No toxin. No organic cause of any kind. Just laughter cascading through social networks, leaving exhausted and bewildered communities in its wake.</p>

<h2>Schools: The Perfect Incubator</h2>

<p>If you wanted to design an environment optimized for mass psychogenic illness, you might well create something resembling a school. You would gather large numbers of young people—who appear particularly susceptible—and confine them together for extended periods. You would add academic pressure, social hierarchies, limited autonomy, and institutional authority. Then you would wait.</p>

<p>School-based outbreaks have occurred worldwide. In 1965, at a girls' school in Blackburn, England, several students complained of dizziness one Thursday morning. By that afternoon, eighty-five girls had been rushed to the hospital by ambulance, exhibiting symptoms including fainting, moaning, teeth chattering, rapid breathing, and tetany—a condition involving involuntary muscle contractions.</p>

<p>Extensive testing found nothing wrong. The water was clean. The air was safe. No contamination appeared in any sample. Yet the pattern of the outbreak told its own story. It began among fourteen-year-olds but quickly spread to younger students, who proved more susceptible even though older students experienced more severe and longer-lasting symptoms.</p>

<p>The researchers who studied the Blackburn outbreak identified a triggering event. The day before the first cases appeared, the school had held a three-hour parade ceremony. Twenty girls had fainted during that parade. The combination of a recent local polio epidemic, which had left the community emotionally vulnerable, and the dramatic visible fainting the previous day created the conditions for a psychological chain reaction.</p>

<h2>Kosovo: When Politics Poisons the Mind</h2>

<p>In the spring of 1990, thousands of people fell ill in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The symptoms included headaches, dizziness, difficulty breathing, muscle weakness, burning sensations, cramps, chest pain, dry mouth, and nausea. Nearly all the victims were ethnic Albanians, most of them young adolescents.</p>

<p>After the outbreak subsided, a federal commission concluded that the illness was psychogenic—that no toxin or pathogen was responsible. This explanation satisfied no one.</p>

<p>Albanian doctors believed they had witnessed a mass poisoning, perhaps by the Serbian authorities who controlled the province. Serbian doctors rejected the psychological explanation too, but from the opposite direction—they suggested the Albanians had faked the entire thing to discredit Serbia on the world stage.</p>

<p>What made the Kosovo outbreak so intractable was its political context. The province was already a tinderbox of ethnic tension between its Albanian majority and the Serbian government. In this environment, even the diagnosis itself became a weapon. To call it psychogenic was, to Albanian ears, to deny their victimhood. To call it poisoning was, to Serbian ears, to accuse them of atrocity.</p>

<p>The researcher who documented this outbreak, Radovanovic, concluded that the volatile political situation hadn't just influenced how people interpreted the illness—it had actually precipitated the illness in the first place. Mass psychogenic illness feeds on collective anxiety, and few things generate collective anxiety more reliably than ethnic conflict and political oppression.</p>

<h2>Afghanistan: The Poisoned Schools</h2>

<p>Beginning around 2009, a disturbing pattern emerged at girls' schools across Afghanistan. Students would suddenly develop dizziness, fainting spells, and vomiting. Word spread that the schools were being poisoned—targeted by groups opposed to female education.</p>

<p>The investigations that followed were exhaustive. The United Nations examined the incidents. The World Health Organization sent experts. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's International Security Assistance Force, the military coalition operating in Afghanistan, conducted its own assessments. Together, they tested hundreds of blood, urine, and water samples.</p>

<p>They found nothing. No toxins. No poisons. No evidence of any chemical agent.</p>

<p>The investigators concluded that the girls were experiencing mass psychogenic illness, triggered by the genuine dangers they faced in a country where attending school could make a girl a target for violence. The fear was real. The threat was real. The illness, though psychogenic, was also real—the girls were genuinely sick. Their bodies had simply converted their terror into physical symptoms.</p>

<h2>The Le Roy Tourette's Outbreak</h2>

<p>In 2011, students at Le Roy Junior-Senior High School in upstate New York began exhibiting symptoms that looked remarkably like Tourette syndrome—involuntary tics, verbal outbursts, and uncontrolled movements. Multiple students were affected, and the cluster of cases sparked concern that some environmental factor must be responsible.</p>

<p>Health officials investigated every plausible explanation. They tested whether the HPV vaccine Gardasil might be responsible. They examined the drinking water for contamination. They checked for illegal drug use, carbon monoxide exposure, and various other environmental or infectious possibilities.</p>

<p>Every test came back negative. The diagnosis: conversion disorder spreading through mass psychogenic illness. The students' bodies had converted psychological distress into neurological symptoms that mimicked a recognized medical condition. The illness was real, but its origins lay in the mind rather than the environment.</p>

<h2>Malaysia: Screaming at Evil</h2>

<p>In August 2019, students at a secondary school in Kelantan, Malaysia, began screaming uncontrollably. Some reported seeing what they described as "a face of pure evil." The outbreak spread rapidly through the school, affecting multiple students before authorities could restore order.</p>

<p>Experts who analyzed the incident pointed to Kelantan's particular characteristics. It is the most religiously conservative state in Malaysia, with strict implementation of Islamic law in schools. The academic and social environment places intense pressure on students, particularly young women.</p>

<p>Malaysian culture also provides a rich vocabulary of supernatural explanations for such experiences. Stories abound of toyol—the spirits of dead infants—and pontianak—vampiric female ghosts—and penanggalan—vengeful spirits that detach their heads from their bodies to hunt victims. These traditional beliefs can provide a framework through which stressed individuals interpret and express psychological distress.</p>

<p>The authorities' response to the outbreak was revealing. They cut down the trees around the school, treating the supernatural explanation as if it were literally true. Whether this intervention helped by providing symbolic reassurance or hurt by validating the belief in spirits is impossible to say.</p>

<h2>Nepal: The Recurring Outbreak</h2>

<p>Most mass psychogenic illness outbreaks are singular events. They erupt, spread, and eventually burn themselves out. But a school in Nepal's Pyuthan district experienced something more unusual: the same outbreak returning year after year.</p>

<p>In 2018, a nine-year-old girl at the school suddenly began crying and shouting uncontrollably. Within the same day, forty-seven students were affected—thirty-seven girls and ten boys. The illness spread rapidly through the student body before subsiding.</p>

<p>What made this case remarkable was its history. Similar episodes of mass psychogenic illness had occurred at the same school every year since 2016. The school had become, in effect, primed for these outbreaks. Each previous episode created a template that made the next one more likely.</p>

<h2>Iran: Poisoning That Wasn't</h2>

<p>In late 2022 and early 2023, thousands of Iranian students, mostly girls, reported sudden illnesses at schools across the country. The symptoms looked like poisoning, and authorities initially treated the cases as criminal attacks. They made numerous arrests, searching for perpetrators who were deliberately targeting schools.</p>

<p>In April 2023, Iran's Intelligence Ministry released the results of a comprehensive investigation. They had found no evidence of any toxic substances. The reported illnesses, they concluded, resulted from a combination of factors: exposure to various non-toxic substances that were misinterpreted as poisons, and mass hysteria spreading through the student population.</p>

<h2>Why This Happens</h2>

<p>The question that haunts every investigation of mass psychogenic illness is simple: why? Why do bodies generate real symptoms without real causes? Why do these symptoms spread from person to person like an infection?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the strange power of the mind over the body. Under sufficient stress, the nervous system can produce physical symptoms without any external trigger. Pain, nausea, paralysis, blindness, seizures—the body is capable of generating all of these from psychological causes alone. This is not malingering or fakery. The person experiencing conversion symptoms is genuinely suffering, genuinely unable to control what their body is doing.</p>

<p>When one person in a group begins exhibiting these symptoms, others see it happen. They hear about it. They begin to worry that they might be affected too. That worry itself generates stress. And in some individuals, that stress tips over into physical symptoms—which then become visible to still more people, amplifying the cycle further.</p>

<p>Certain conditions make outbreaks more likely. Environments where people have limited autonomy and face intense pressure—convents, factories, schools—provide fertile ground. Groups that are already experiencing collective anxiety, whether from political conflict, economic stress, or public health fears, are more vulnerable. And crucially, media coverage tends to accelerate outbreaks rather than calm them.</p>

<p>Research has looked for personality traits or other factors that might predict who becomes affected in these outbreaks. Are extroverts more susceptible? People who score higher on measures of neuroticism? Those with lower intelligence test scores? The evidence doesn't support any of these hypotheses. As researchers Robert Bartholomew and Simon Wessely concluded, there appears to be no particular predisposition to mass psychogenic illness. "It is a behavioral reaction that anyone can show in the right circumstances."</p>

<h2>The Attention Trap</h2>

<p>One of the most consistent findings in studies of mass psychogenic illness is that official attention tends to make things worse.</p>

<p>When authorities respond to an outbreak by calling in specialists, conducting elaborate tests, or—as in the Singapore factory cases—summoning a medicine man to perform an exorcism, they inadvertently validate the idea that something real and dangerous is occurring. This validation fuels further anxiety, which produces further symptoms, which attracts further attention.</p>

<p>Historian John Waller, who has extensively studied the medieval dancing plagues, advises that once an illness is determined to be psychogenic, authorities should avoid giving it credence. The challenge, of course, is that this advice conflicts with the natural impulse to investigate and respond to what appears to be a medical emergency.</p>

<p>Media coverage presents a similar dilemma. Intense reporting on an outbreak informs the public but also spreads awareness of the symptoms, potentially recruiting more cases. The Tanganyika laughter epidemic traveled along social networks, but it also traveled along information networks—people who heard about the laughter from others proved vulnerable to developing it themselves.</p>

<h2>The Reality of Psychogenic Illness</h2>

<p>There is a persistent temptation to dismiss mass psychogenic illness as somehow less real than illness caused by pathogens or toxins. The people affected are "just" stressed. Their symptoms are "only" psychological. They should be able to control themselves.</p>

<p>This misunderstands what psychogenic illness actually is. The symptoms are not imaginary. A person experiencing psychogenic paralysis cannot move their limbs no matter how hard they try. A person in a psychogenic seizure is not choosing to convulse. The mechanism is psychological, but the physical manifestation is entirely real.</p>

<p>In some ways, mass psychogenic illness is more disturbing than ordinary contagion. A virus or bacterium can be identified, isolated, and treated. A toxic chemical can be detected and removed. But when the contagion travels through minds rather than through air or water, there is no filter that can stop it, no vaccine that can prevent it. The outbreak ends only when the conditions that produced it change.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most important lesson from centuries of documented cases. Mass psychogenic illness is not a failure of individual willpower or a sign of weakness or gullibility. It is a collective response to collective conditions. The nuns in their convents, the workers in their factories, the students in their schools—they were not defective. They were human beings responding to circumstances that exceeded their capacity to cope.</p>

<p>Understanding this doesn't make mass psychogenic illness less mysterious. If anything, it deepens the mystery. How exactly does seeing someone else faint make your own body faint? What neural pathways transform anxiety about a rumored poison into actual nausea and dizziness? How can laughter—of all things—become genuinely contagious?</p>

<p>We are only beginning to understand the mechanisms involved. But the phenomenon itself has been with us for as long as humans have gathered in groups, shared their fears, and watched each other's bodies respond to invisible threats. It is, in its strange way, a reminder of how deeply connected we are—and how powerful those connections can be.</p>
