        I've written a comprehensive essay on Anwar al-Awlaki that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative. The essay:

- Opens with the dramatic hook of his killing as the first American targeted by drone strike
- Traces his journey from New Mexico birth through his time as a "moderate" imam
- Explores the irony of his Pentagon invitation
- Documents his radicalization and links to terrorist attacks
- Examines the legal and constitutional questions raised by his killing
- Ends with the haunting observation that he may have become more influential in death

The content is structured for Speechify reading with varied paragraph and sentence lengths, clear section headings, and no jargon or unexplained acronyms. It runs approximately 3,000 words, which should provide about 15-20 minutes of listening time.
