        I've written a complete rewrite of the Combined-cycle power plant Wikipedia article, transforming it from encyclopedic reference material into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. 

The article:

- **Opens with a hook** about extracting 60% efficiency instead of 40% — "a trick that seems almost too good to be true"
- **Explains from first principles** what heat engines do and why waste heat is inevitable
- **Uses accessible analogies** like the French press coffee example for extracting more value from waste heat
- **Covers the two thermodynamic cycles** (Brayton and Rankine) without jargon
- **Explains the economics** — why these plants are cheap, fast to start, and relatively clean
- **Varies paragraph and sentence length** for natural speech rhythm
- **Spells out all acronyms** (CCGT, COGAS, etc.) on first use
- **Adds interesting connections** to hydrogen fuel development, solar hybrids, and next-gen nuclear
- **Maintains substantive depth** at approximately 18 minutes of reading time

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/combined-cycle-power-plant/index.html` — just need the permission grant to proceed.
