        I've written a comprehensive essay on reserve powers that transforms the Wikipedia article into engaging narrative content optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the dramatic 1975 Australian dismissal as a hook
- Explains reserve powers through accessible analogies (the "emergency brake" and "fire extinguisher")
- Covers major historical examples: Australia (1932 and 1975), Belgium (1990), Canada (1896 and 1925), and New Zealand
- Explores the philosophical tension between democratic authority and constitutional safeguards
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio listening
- Avoids jargon and explains concepts from first principles

The content is ready for your approval to write to the file.
