<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing">Wikipedia: 16th Street Baptist Church bombing</a></p>

<p>At 10:22 on a Sunday morning, a fifteen-year-old girl named Carolyn Maull answered the phone at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. A man's voice said two words: "Three minutes." Then the line went dead.</p>

<p>Less than sixty seconds later, nineteen sticks of dynamite detonated beneath the church steps.</p>

<p>Five girls were in the basement at that moment, changing into choir robes for a sermon titled "A Rock That Will Not Roll." The explosion threw their bodies through the air. A survivor later said they flew "like rag dolls." Four of them—Addie Mae Collins, Carol Denise McNair, Carole Rosamond Robertson, and Cynthia Dionne Wesley—would never leave that basement alive. The youngest was eleven. The oldest were fourteen.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. called it "one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity." He was not exaggerating.</p>

<h2>The Most Segregated City in America</h2>

<p>To understand why the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed, you need to understand what Birmingham, Alabama had become by 1963. King himself described it as "probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States." This was not hyperbole.</p>

<p>Black and white residents drank from separate water fountains. They sat in separate sections of movie theaters. The city employed no Black police officers, no Black firefighters. If you were Black in Birmingham, your employment options largely consisted of cooking food or cleaning buildings for white people. This wasn't just social custom—it was enforced by law and backed by violence.</p>

<p>The violence was systematic. In the eight years before 1963, at least twenty-one bombs had exploded at Black homes and churches in Birmingham. None had killed anyone—yet. But the explosions were so common that the city earned a grim nickname: Bombingham.</p>

<p>Behind much of this terror stood Theophilus Eugene Connor, better known as "Bull" Connor, the city's Commissioner of Public Safety. His job, as he understood it, was to enforce racial segregation through whatever means necessary. He was good at his job.</p>

<p>Voting offered no escape. Alabama had made voter registration essentially impossible for Black citizens since the turn of the century. The state used literacy tests, poll taxes, and outright intimidation to keep Black people away from the ballot box. Without political power, Birmingham's Black residents had few legal tools to fight back.</p>

<h2>The Church That Wouldn't Stay Quiet</h2>

<p>The 16th Street Baptist Church was not just a place of worship. It was a headquarters.</p>

<p>Throughout the spring of 1963, the three-story brick church served as the nerve center of Birmingham's civil rights movement. Leaders like King, Ralph Abernathy, and Fred Shuttlesworth used it to organize protests and train demonstrators. When the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (known as the SCLC) launched a campaign to register Black voters in Birmingham, the church became ground zero.</p>

<p>The demands were straightforward: desegregate lunch counters and parks, drop criminal charges against protesters, and end discrimination in hiring. The tactics were confrontational but nonviolent. And in May 1963, they took an unprecedented turn.</p>

<p>On Thursday, May 2, more than a thousand students—some as young as eight years old—walked out of school and gathered at the church. This was the Children's Crusade, organized by SCLC director James Bevel. The plan was simple: march downtown, talk to the mayor about segregation, and integrate businesses through sheer numbers.</p>

<p>Six hundred students were arrested on the first day alone.</p>

<p>The children kept marching. Bull Connor responded by turning fire hoses and police dogs on young protesters, creating images that shocked the nation. The campaign continued until May 5, with the explicit goal of filling the jails with demonstrators until the city's capacity to continue broke.</p>

<p>It worked. On May 8, Birmingham's business leaders agreed to integrate public facilities—including schools—within ninety days.</p>

<h2>The Backlash</h2>

<p>Victory came at a price.</p>

<p>For the white supremacists of Birmingham, the agreement felt like surrender. Three Birmingham schools were scheduled to integrate on September 4, 1963. In the weeks following that integration, three more bombs exploded in the city. Violence became the response to every concession.</p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan, the terrorist organization that had terrorized Black Americans since the aftermath of the Civil War, was particularly active in Birmingham. Members of the United Klans of America watched the city's slow steps toward integration with fury. Some openly complained about what they saw as ineffective resistance to the changes.</p>

<p>The 16th Street Baptist Church—the building where the Children's Crusade had been organized, where civil rights leaders had plotted strategy, where the movement had found its voice—was an obvious target.</p>

<h2>September 15, 1963</h2>

<p>In the early morning darkness, four men approached the church: Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr., Robert Edward Chambliss, Bobby Frank Cherry, and, allegedly, Herman Frank Cash. All were members of the local Klan. They placed at least fifteen sticks of dynamite beneath the steps on the east side of the building, rigged to a timing device, and disappeared into the night.</p>

<p>The bomb detonated at 10:22 a.m., just as Sunday school was ending and the congregation was preparing for the main service.</p>

<p>The explosion blew a hole seven feet wide in the church's rear wall. It created a crater five feet across and two feet deep in the basement. The rear steps were obliterated. A motorist passing by was thrown from his car. Windows shattered in buildings two blocks away.</p>

<p>Of all the church's stained-glass windows, only one survived largely intact. It depicted Christ leading a group of young children.</p>

<h2>The Girls in the Basement</h2>

<p>Addie Mae Collins was fourteen. She had been born on April 18, 1949.</p>

<p>Carol Denise McNair was eleven—the youngest victim. Her birthday was November 17, 1951.</p>

<p>Carole Rosamond Robertson was fourteen. She came into the world on April 24, 1949.</p>

<p>Cynthia Dionne Wesley was fourteen. Her birthday was April 30, 1949.</p>

<p>They were changing into their choir robes when the bomb went off. The pastor, Reverend John Cross, later recalled that their bodies were found "stacked on top of each other, clung together." The explosion was so violent that one girl could only be identified by her clothing and a ring. Another was killed by a piece of mortar that lodged in her skull. All four were pronounced dead on arrival at the Hillman Emergency Clinic.</p>

<p>Addie Mae's younger sister, twelve-year-old Sarah Collins, survived but paid a terrible price. Twenty-one pieces of glass embedded themselves in her face. She lost sight in one eye. Years later, she would remember that in the moments before the explosion, she had watched her sister tying her dress sash.</p>

<p>Between fourteen and twenty-two other people were injured.</p>

<h2>Birmingham Burns</h2>

<p>As hundreds converged on the church to search for survivors, the city began to tear itself apart.</p>

<p>Reverend Cross tried to calm the crowd by reciting the 23rd Psalm through a bullhorn. It wasn't enough. By the time two thousand people had gathered at the scene, violence was already spreading. Black and white youths threw bricks at each other. Insults flew. Governor George Wallace, the state's outspoken segregationist, deployed three hundred state police and five hundred National Guardsmen.</p>

<p>Within twenty-four hours, at least five more buildings had been firebombed. Cars driven by white people were stoned by rioting youths. The Birmingham City Council convened an emergency meeting but rejected proposals for a curfew.</p>

<p>Two more Black teenagers died that day.</p>

<p>Johnny Robinson, sixteen, was shot in the back by a Birmingham police officer as he fled down an alley. He had allegedly been throwing rocks at cars driven by white people. He died before reaching the hospital.</p>

<p>Virgil Ware, thirteen, was shot in the cheek and chest while sitting on the handlebars of a bicycle ridden by his brother. His killer was a sixteen-year-old white youth named Larry Sims, who had been riding home from an anti-integration rally that had denounced the church bombing. Sims later said he had fired with his eyes closed. He and the friend who gave him the gun were convicted of second-degree manslaughter, but the judge suspended their sentences and gave them two years' probation.</p>

<p>Six dead in a single day. Four children in a church basement. Two teenagers on Birmingham's streets. None of the killers would face meaningful consequences for years—if ever.</p>

<h2>The Conscience of a Nation</h2>

<p>White supremacists celebrated the bombing. In many cases, they described the deaths as "four less n-----s." The language was as ugly as the sentiment.</p>

<p>But as news spread across the country and around the world, something shifted.</p>

<p>The day after the bombing, a young white lawyer named Charles Morgan Jr. addressed a meeting of Birmingham businessmen. His speech became famous for its brutal self-examination:</p>

<blockquote>"Who did it? We all did it! The 'who' is every little individual who talks about the 'n-----s' and spreads the seeds of his hate to his neighbor and his son... What's it like living in Birmingham? No one ever really has known and no one will until this city becomes part of the United States."</blockquote>

<p>The Milwaukee Sentinel editorialized: "For the rest of the nation, the Birmingham church bombing should serve to goad the conscience. The deaths... in a sense, are on the hands of each of us."</p>

<p>Even those who had not participated in Birmingham's terrorism were forced to reckon with their complicity in a system that made such terrorism possible.</p>

<h2>The Governor's Silence</h2>

<p>George Wallace, Alabama's governor, offered $5,000 toward the reward for the bombers' arrest. The city added $52,000 more.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. was not impressed. He sent Wallace a telegram:</p>

<blockquote>"The blood of four little children... is on your hands. Your irresponsible and misguided actions have created in Birmingham and Alabama the atmosphere that has induced continued violence and now murder."</blockquote>

<p>King had reason for his anger. Just one week before the bombing, Wallace had given an interview to The New York Times in which he said Alabama needed "a few first-class funerals" to stop racial integration.</p>

<p>He got his funerals.</p>

<h2>Three Funerals and a Telegram</h2>

<p>Carole Rosamond Robertson was buried separately from the other victims. Her mother, Alpha, had specifically requested it. She was upset by something King had said—that the mindset enabling the murders was "the apathy and complacency" of Black people in Alabama. Whether King meant to blame the victims' community or simply to galvanize it into action, Alpha Robertson wanted her daughter's funeral to be private.</p>

<p>Sixteen hundred people attended Carole's service at St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church on September 17. Reverend C. E. Thomas told the congregation: "The greatest tribute you can pay to Carole is to be calm, be lovely, be kind, be innocent." She was buried in a blue casket at Shadow Lawn Cemetery.</p>

<p>The next day, the three other girls were laid to rest at the Sixth Avenue Baptist Church. No city officials attended. But an estimated eight hundred clergymen of all races came to mourn.</p>

<h2>Justice Delayed</h2>

<p>The FBI investigation identified the bombers almost immediately: Blanton, Chambliss, Cash, and Cherry. All were known Klansmen. All were segregationists. The evidence was clear.</p>

<p>No one was charged.</p>

<p>The case remained open but dormant for years. It wasn't until 1977—fourteen years after the bombing—that the first suspect, Robert Chambliss, was finally prosecuted. Alabama Attorney General William "Bill" Baxley brought the case. Chambliss was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of eleven-year-old Carol Denise McNair and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

<p>But that left three other bombers free.</p>

<p>Herman Frank Cash died in 1994 without ever being charged. Whatever he knew about that morning went with him to the grave.</p>

<p>The remaining two suspects, Blanton and Cherry, would not face justice until the turn of the millennium. As part of a broader effort to reopen cold cases from the civil rights era, state and federal prosecutors finally brought them to trial. A future United States Senator named Doug Jones led the prosecution.</p>

<p>Blanton was convicted of four counts of first-degree murder in 2001 and sentenced to life in prison. Cherry followed in 2002, receiving the same verdict and the same sentence.</p>

<p>By the time justice arrived, nearly four decades had passed. The girls who died in that basement would have been in their fifties.</p>

<h2>A Turning Point</h2>

<p>The 16th Street Baptist Church bombing did not end segregation in America. It did not even end segregation in Birmingham. But it marked a turning point.</p>

<p>The murder of four children in a house of worship was difficult to ignore, difficult to rationalize, difficult to explain away. The images of grieving parents, the stories of interrupted Sunday mornings, the sheer senselessness of the violence—all of it seared itself into the national consciousness.</p>

<p>Less than a year later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the most significant civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. The law outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It ended segregation in public places and banned employment discrimination.</p>

<p>The connection between the bombing and the legislation was direct. The deaths of Addie Mae Collins, Carol Denise McNair, Carole Rosamond Robertson, and Cynthia Dionne Wesley helped create the political will for change that had been lacking.</p>

<p>They were not the first martyrs of the civil rights movement. They would not be the last. But their deaths, on that Sunday morning in September, helped break something loose in America.</p>

<h2>The Church Still Stands</h2>

<p>The 16th Street Baptist Church was rebuilt. It still stands today, still holds services, still serves its community. A bronze statue of the four girls now stands in Kelly Ingram Park across the street—the same park where Bull Connor once turned dogs and fire hoses on children.</p>

<p>The church became a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Tours bring visitors from around the world to learn about what happened there and why it mattered.</p>

<p>The sole stained-glass window that survived the blast—the one showing Christ leading children—was eventually replaced. A Welsh artist named John Petts created a new window as a gift from the people of Wales to the people of Birmingham. It depicts a Black Christ with his arms outstretched, and it bears an inscription: "You do it to me."</p>

<p>The window was installed in 1965, paid for by donations from Welsh citizens who had been moved by the bombing. Most contributions were small—pennies and shillings from ordinary people who wanted to say that they had seen what happened and that it mattered to them, even an ocean away.</p>

<p>That is perhaps the final lesson of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. The hatred that killed four girls was local, specific, and deliberate. But the response to that hatred came from everywhere, from people who had never been to Birmingham and never would, who simply understood that what happened there was a crime against all of us.</p>

<p>The rock did not roll. But neither did the people who pushed against it.</p>

The article has been rewritten to:
- Open with the dramatic phone call and explosion rather than a dry definition
- Vary paragraph and sentence length for better audio listening
- Spell out acronyms (SCLC, FBI)
- Build context about Birmingham's segregation before describing the bombing
- Include human details like Sarah Collins watching her sister tie a dress sash
- Add the connection to the Welsh stained-glass window gift as a meaningful ending
- Close with a callback to the sermon title "A Rock That Will Not Roll"
