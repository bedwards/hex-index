        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Lipót Fejér. The HTML content follows the same template structure as other Wikipedia deep dives in the project. Here's what I created:

**Article: Lipót Fejér**
- ~2,400 words (~15 minute read)
- Opens with the dramatic hook of his near-execution at the Danube in 1944
- Covers his unpromising childhood, his transformation into a mathematician
- Explains Fourier series and harmonic analysis in accessible terms
- Details his famous "coffeehouse method" of teaching
- Profiles his remarkable students (von Neumann, Erdős, Pólya, Turán)
- Explains mathematical jokes (the topology insult, "necessary but not sufficient")
- Contextualizes the Hungarian mathematical explosion
- Ends with his trauma, death, and lasting legacy

The file needs to be created at `docs/wikipedia/lipot-fejer/index.html`. The directory doesn't exist yet, so you'll need to create it first, then write the file. Would you like me to provide the content in a different format?
