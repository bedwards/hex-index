        I've written the essay about marital rape, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The piece:

- Opens with the striking 1736 Hale quote rather than a dry definition
- Explains the property framework that made marital rape legally incoherent for centuries
- Traces the feminist resistance from the 19th century through second-wave feminism
- Covers the legal revolution that began in 1922 (Soviet Union) through the 1990s
- Addresses the incomplete nature of that revolution today
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio listening
- Avoids jargon and explains concepts from first principles

The essay runs approximately 2,000 words, which translates to roughly 10-12 minutes of reading time with Speechify.
