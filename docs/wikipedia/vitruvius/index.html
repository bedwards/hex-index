        I've written the Vitruvius essay. Here's the rewritten content:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Wikipedia: Vitruvius</a></p>

<p>Every building you have ever admired owes something to a Roman artillery officer who lived two thousand years ago. His name was Vitruvius, and he wrote the only architectural treatise to survive from the ancient world—a book so influential that when Leonardo da Vinci drew his famous image of a man with outstretched arms inside a circle and square, he was illustrating a passage from this long-dead engineer's text.</p>

<p>But here is what makes Vitruvius truly remarkable: he was not primarily an architect at all. He was a military engineer who built siege weapons.</p>

<h2>The Artillery Expert Who Shaped Architecture</h2>

<p>Vitruvius served in the Roman army during one of the most violent and consequential periods in history—the final decades of the Roman Republic, when Julius Caesar was conquering Gaul and fighting civil wars across the Mediterranean. Vitruvius's job was constructing ballistae and scorpiones, the massive crossbow-like artillery pieces that could hurl bolts or stones at enemy fortifications.</p>

<p>These were not small devices. A Roman ballista could launch a projectile with enough force to punch through wooden walls or kill armored soldiers at distances of several hundred meters. Building one required sophisticated knowledge of materials, geometry, tension, and mechanical principles. The same principles, it turns out, that underlie all good construction.</p>

<p>We can trace Vitruvius's likely military career through the sieges he describes in unusual detail. He was present—or nearly so—at some of the most brutal conflicts of the era. The siege of Avaricum in 52 BCE, where the entire population of forty thousand was massacred. The circumvallation of Alesia that same year, where Caesar's forces built walls facing both inward (to trap the defenders) and outward (to repel relief forces), and where the trapped civilians expelled women and children to conserve food, leaving them to starve in the no-man's-land between the walls.</p>

<p>This was the world that produced our first architectural theorist.</p>

<h2>What We Actually Know About Him</h2>

<p>Almost nothing, really. We do not even know his full name with certainty. "Marcus Vitruvius Pollio" appears in some sources, but scholars debate whether both the Marcus and the Pollio are authentic. We know he dedicated his masterwork to the Emperor Augustus, which places his writing firmly in the early years of the Roman Empire. We know he had a patron—Augustus's sister Octavia—who provided him with what may have been a pension, allowing him to write in financial security.</p>

<p>We know of exactly one building he designed: a basilica in the coastal town of Fanum Fortunae, modern Fano in Italy. This building has vanished so completely that archaeologists cannot even agree on where it stood. It may have been absorbed into the medieval cathedral that now occupies the town center, following the common early Christian practice of converting Roman public buildings into churches.</p>

<p>The most telling detail about Vitruvius's life might be this: we do not know when he died, which strongly suggests he was not famous during his own lifetime. Famous Romans left traces. Vitruvius, it seems, did not.</p>

<h2>The Ten Books</h2>

<p>And yet he left behind something more durable than any building: <em>De architectura</em>, known in English as <em>The Ten Books on Architecture</em>. Written in Latin and dedicated to Augustus, this work covers an astonishing range of subjects that modern readers would not necessarily consider architecture at all.</p>

<p>To a Roman, an architect was something closer to what we might call a master builder, civil engineer, urban planner, construction manager, and military engineer rolled into one. The word itself comes from Greek roots meaning "master builder." Vitruvius's Ten Books accordingly addresses not just temples and houses but also water clocks, siege engines, city planning, aqueducts, heating systems, acoustics, sundials, astronomy, and the proper way to select building sites based on prevailing winds and the direction of marshes.</p>

<p>On that last point, Vitruvius was onto something important without quite understanding why. He advocated avoiding marshy areas because morning breezes would carry "the poisonous breath of the creatures of the marshes" into the bodies of inhabitants. This is the miasma theory of disease—the idea that bad air caused illness. It was wrong about the mechanism (we now know mosquitoes transmit malaria, not bad air), but absolutely correct about the practical conclusion: do not build your town next to a swamp.</p>

<h2>Firmness, Commodity, and Delight</h2>

<p>Vitruvius's most enduring contribution is a deceptively simple idea. He argued that every building must possess three qualities: <em>firmitas</em>, <em>utilitas</em>, and <em>venustas</em>. Strength, utility, and beauty.</p>

<p>A building must stand up. It must serve its purpose. It must please the eye and spirit.</p>

<p>This sounds obvious. It was not. Before Vitruvius wrote it down, these ideas existed implicitly in the practice of good builders, but no one had codified them into a theory. By making these principles explicit, Vitruvius created a framework that architects have been arguing about, refining, and occasionally rejecting for two millennia.</p>

<p>Consider what happens when you violate any one of these principles. A beautiful building that falls down is a tragedy. A sturdy, practical building that offends the eye is a blight. A gorgeous, structurally sound building that does not serve its users is a monument to vanity. The genius of Vitruvius's formulation is that it demands all three qualities simultaneously. You cannot trade one off against another.</p>

<h2>The Vitruvian Man</h2>

<p>Vitruvius believed that architecture should reflect the proportions of the human body—that both were expressions of the same cosmic order. He described, in precise mathematical terms, how a well-proportioned man could be inscribed within both a circle and a square, the fundamental shapes of geometry.</p>

<p>This passage lay dormant for over a thousand years. Then, around 1490, Leonardo da Vinci read it and drew what has become one of the most recognizable images in Western art: a nude male figure with arms and legs in two positions, simultaneously fitting within a perfect circle and a perfect square.</p>

<p>Leonardo was not the only Renaissance artist to attempt this. Many tried. His version endures because he understood that Vitruvius's geometry was not quite right as written, and he corrected it. The center of the circle is not the same as the center of the square; the navel centers one, the groin the other. Leonardo's drawing is both an illustration of Vitruvius and an improvement on him.</p>

<h2>Lost and Found</h2>

<p>Vitruvius's text never truly vanished during the medieval period. Dozens of manuscript copies survived in monastery libraries across Europe, and scholars consulted it throughout the Middle Ages. But in 1414, the Florentine humanist Poggio Bracciolini "rediscovered" a copy in the library of Saint Gall Abbey in Switzerland, and this event sparked a Renaissance craze for Vitruvian ideas.</p>

<p>The word "rediscovery" deserves those quotation marks. Poggio did not find a lost text so much as dramatically publicize a known one. The Renaissance was very good at this particular form of marketing—announcing ancient wisdom as if it were news.</p>

<p>But the enthusiasm was real. Leon Battista Alberti used Vitruvius as the foundation for his own architectural treatise, <em>De re aedificatoria</em>, published around 1450. This was the first major new book on architecture since Vitruvius himself. The first printed edition of <em>De architectura</em> appeared in Rome in 1486. The first illustrated edition—crucial for a book about visual art—came out in Venice in 1511, with woodcuts based on descriptions in the text, since any original illustrations had long since been lost.</p>

<p>Every major Renaissance architect read Vitruvius. Bramante read him. Michelangelo read him. Palladio read him and then wrote his own <em>Four Books of Architecture</em>, which shaped everything from English country houses to the United States Capitol. When Thomas Jefferson designed the Virginia State Capitol and the University of Virginia, he was working within a tradition that traced directly back to a Roman artillery officer who had watched Caesar's legions storm the walls of Gallic cities.</p>

<h2>The Education of an Architect</h2>

<p>Vitruvius had opinions—strong ones—about what an architect should know. His list is intimidating. Drawing, obviously. Geometry. Optics, which at the time meant understanding how light behaves in buildings. History, because buildings often incorporate symbolic references. Philosophy, for ethical grounding. Music, which relates to acoustics and proportional theory. Medicine, for understanding healthy building conditions. Law, for navigating property rights and contracts. Even astronomy, for orienting sundials and understanding seasonal light.</p>

<p>This was not realistic then, and it is certainly not realistic now. No one person can master all these fields. But Vitruvius was making a deeper point: architecture sits at the intersection of art and science, of beauty and function, of individual creativity and social responsibility. The architect must be able to think across boundaries.</p>

<p>He drew a sharp distinction between practice and theory, and insisted that both were essential:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mere practical architect is not able to assign sufficient reasons for the forms he adopts; and the theoretic architect also fails, grasping the shadow instead of the substance. He who is theoretic as well as practical, is therefore doubly armed; able not only to prove the propriety of his design, but equally so to carry it into execution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: it is not enough to know how to build. You must also know why you build the way you do. And it is not enough to have theories. You must be able to turn those theories into actual structures that stand up.</p>

<h2>The Greeks Did It First</h2>

<p>Vitruvius never claimed to be inventing architecture. He was codifying it. And he was clear about where the fundamental ideas came from: Greece.</p>

<p>According to Vitruvius, the Greeks invented the three architectural orders that define classical buildings: Doric (the simplest, with no base and a plain capital), Ionic (more ornate, with scroll-shaped volutes on the capital), and Corinthian (the most elaborate, with capitals carved to resemble acanthus leaves). These were not just decorative choices. They represented different proportional systems, different relationships between height and width, different moods and associations.</p>

<p>The Greeks had also, according to Vitruvius, worked out the mathematical proportions of the ideal human body—and recognized that these same proportions should govern architecture. Architecture imitates nature, and the greatest natural work of art is the human form.</p>

<p>We know the Greeks wrote extensively about architecture. Vitruvius mentions multiple Greek treatises, including at least two about the Parthenon alone. None of these survive. His book is our only window into what the Greeks thought about the theory of building. Whether he accurately transmitted their ideas, or filtered them through Roman assumptions, we cannot know.</p>

<h2>The Prefect of the Camp</h2>

<p>Before leaving Vitruvius's military career entirely, it is worth understanding what his job actually entailed. The Roman writer Vegetius, writing centuries later about Roman military organization, described the role of the camp prefect—the senior engineering officer—in detail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The position of the camp, the direction of the entrenchments, the inspection of the tents or huts of the soldiers and the baggage were comprehended in his province. His authority extended over the sick, and the physicians who had the care of them; and he regulated the expenses relative thereto. He had the charge of providing carriages, bathhouses and the proper tools for sawing and cutting wood, digging trenches, raising parapets, sinking wells and bringing water into the camp. He likewise had the care of furnishing the troops with wood and straw, as well as the rams, onagri, balistae and all the other engines of war under his direction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was logistics and engineering on a massive scale. A Roman legion on campaign was a small city that had to be constructed, supplied, defended, and demolished over and over again as the army moved. The prefect needed to understand water supply, sanitation, materials, transport, fortification, medicine, and siege warfare. He needed to solve problems quickly with whatever resources were available.</p>

<p>These skills translate directly into peacetime architecture. Understanding how to build quickly and efficiently for an army prepares you to think about how to build durably and beautifully for a city.</p>

<h2>Acoustics and Pipes</h2>

<p>Two of Vitruvius's contributions deserve special mention. He is often called the father of architectural acoustics for his detailed discussion of theater design. Greek and Roman theaters were open-air structures seating thousands of spectators. Without modern amplification, the actors' voices had to carry naturally to the back rows. Vitruvius described the use of <em>echeas</em>—bronze vessels placed around the theater to resonate with and amplify particular frequencies of sound.</p>

<p>Whether this technique actually worked as described remains debated. But the fact that Vitruvius thought systematically about how sound moves through architectural space, and tried to optimize buildings for acoustic performance, was genuinely innovative.</p>

<p>The other contribution is more prosaic but perhaps more widely useful. Frontinus, a later Roman writer on aqueducts, mentions Vitruvius specifically in connection with the standardization of pipe sizes. Roman aqueducts delivered water through networks of pipes, and those pipes needed to be manufactured to consistent specifications. Vitruvius apparently helped establish those standards. It is possible this is what he was best known for in his own time—not grand architectural theories but practical plumbing.</p>

<h2>The Question of Originality</h2>

<p>How original was Vitruvius? The Renaissance treated him as a genius, the font of all architectural wisdom. Modern scholars are more skeptical. A. W. Lawrence wrote that Vitruvius "recorded a most elaborate set of rules taken from Greek authors, who must have compiled them gradually in the course of the preceding centuries."</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the polymath Gerolamo Cardano ranked Vitruvius among the twelve greatest geniuses in history—but added the qualification that this ranking would be more secure "if it was clear that he had set down his own discoveries."</p>

<p>This ambiguity is built into the text itself. Scholars have wondered whether <em>De architectura</em> as we have it is truly the work of one author, or a compilation assembled by later librarians and copyists who added material from other sources. The question cannot be definitively resolved.</p>

<p>But perhaps originality is the wrong measure. What Vitruvius did—whether he invented the ideas or merely recorded them—was create a comprehensive, organized, accessible account of architectural knowledge that could be studied, taught, and transmitted across centuries. No one else did that. The Greeks apparently wrote many books about architecture; all are lost. Vitruvius wrote one, and it survived.</p>

<h2>The Father of All True Architects</h2>

<p>In 1734, Benjamin Franklin reprinted James Anderson's <em>The Constitutions of the Free-Masons</em>, which described Vitruvius as "the Father of all true Architects to this Day." This may sound like hyperbole. It is not.</p>

<p>When you walk into a building with classical columns, you are seeing Vitruvius's influence. When architects argue about whether a building should prioritize function or aesthetics, they are having a debate Vitruvius framed. When urban planners consider how streets should be oriented relative to prevailing winds, they are following advice that can be traced to <em>De architectura</em>. When engineering students are taught that theory and practice must be combined, they are receiving an education that Vitruvius prescribed.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the foundational text of Western architecture was written by a man who spent his career building siege weapons. But perhaps it is not so surprising. Engineering is engineering. The same principles that let you build a machine capable of hurling stones through walls will let you build walls that stones cannot penetrate. The same understanding of materials, forces, and geometry serves destruction and creation alike.</p>

<p>Vitruvius understood this. His book moves seamlessly from temples to catapults, from the proportions of the human body to the design of water clocks. It is all one discipline to him. The boundaries we draw between civil engineering and architecture, between military technology and public works, between art and craft, did not exist in his mind.</p>

<p>Perhaps that comprehensive vision is his greatest legacy. Not any particular rule or proportion, but the idea that building well requires understanding everything—materials, mathematics, history, music, medicine, law, and the deepest principles of natural order. The architect must be a master of many arts, able to see how they all fit together.</p>

<p>Two thousand years later, we are still trying to live up to that standard.</p>
