        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Royal British Legion. The essay transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.

Key features of the rewrite:
- Opens with an evocative hook about the poppy ritual rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for good audio rhythm
- Explains context from first principles (why the Legion was founded, the class anxieties involved)
- Adds historical connections (John McCrae's poem, parallel organizations globally)
- Covers controversies fairly (Tony Blair donation, Women's Section integration, HR issues)
- Avoids jargon and spells out concepts when introduced
- Ends with a reflective synthesis rather than a list of facts
