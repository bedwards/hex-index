        I've written a rewritten Wikipedia article about film grain as an engaging essay. The content transforms the encyclopedic source material into a narrative that:

1. Opens with an intriguing hook about the specks that made all film photography possible
2. Explains the physics of how film grain works from first principles
3. Covers the trade-off between light sensitivity and grain size
4. Describes the clever engineering of tabular-grain films
5. Discusses how grain is measured scientifically
6. Compares film grain to digital sensor noise
7. Explores the ironic return of artificial grain in digital photography
8. Ends with a philosophical reflection on randomness and imperfection

The essay is formatted with semantic HTML and optimized for text-to-speech reading with varied paragraph and sentence lengths. It's waiting for write permission to save to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/film-grain/index.html`.
