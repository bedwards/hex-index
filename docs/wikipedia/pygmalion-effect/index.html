<h2>The Power of What We Expect</h2>

<p>In 1911, a horse named Clever Hans was the toast of Berlin. This remarkable animal could supposedly read, spell, and solve arithmetic problems by tapping his hoof. Give him a math problem, and he would tap out the correct answer. Skeptics came from all over Europe to expose the fraud—and they discovered something far more interesting than a hoax.</p>

<p>The horse wasn't doing math. He was reading people.</p>

<p>Observers noticed that whenever Hans approached the correct answer, the humans watching him would lean forward slightly, tense up, hold their breath. The moment his hoof struck the right number, they would relax. Hans had learned to detect these microscopic shifts in body language and stop tapping at precisely the right moment. He wasn't clever at arithmetic. He was clever at reading human expectations—and fulfilling them.</p>

<p>This strange case of an accidentally perceptive horse would eventually inspire one of the most controversial experiments in educational psychology, one that suggested something unsettling: our expectations of others might actually shape their abilities.</p>

<h2>The Sculptor and His Statue</h2>

<p>The ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion tells of a sculptor who carved a woman so beautiful from ivory that he fell hopelessly in love with his own creation. He dressed the statue in fine clothes, brought it gifts, and kissed its cold lips. The goddess Aphrodite, moved by his devotion, brought the statue to life.</p>

<p>The psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson borrowed this myth's name for a phenomenon they claimed to have discovered in 1960s California: that teachers' expectations of their students could, like Pygmalion's love, bring potential to life.</p>

<p>Or bury it.</p>

<h2>The Oak School Experiment</h2>

<p>The study worked like this. At the beginning of the school year, all students at a California elementary school took what they were told was a special test designed to identify "intellectual bloomers"—children who were about to experience dramatic intellectual growth. In reality, it was just a standard intelligence test.</p>

<p>The researchers then did something that would be considered ethically dubious today. They randomly selected about twenty percent of the students and told their teachers that these particular children had been identified as bloomers. The test, teachers were told, had revealed these students possessed exceptional potential that was about to manifest.</p>

<p>The test had revealed no such thing. The "bloomers" were chosen completely at random.</p>

<p>At the end of the school year, all the students took the same intelligence test again. What Rosenthal and Jacobson reported seemed almost magical: the randomly designated bloomers, especially the youngest ones in first and second grade, showed significantly greater gains in their intelligence scores than their classmates. The only difference between these children and their peers was what their teachers believed about them.</p>

<h2>How Expectations Might Travel</h2>

<p>If the effect was real, how could a teacher's belief possibly change a child's actual intelligence? Rosenthal theorized that teachers were unconsciously treating the "bloomers" differently in countless subtle ways. Perhaps they made more eye contact. Perhaps they gave these students more time to answer questions before moving on. Perhaps their tone of voice conveyed warmth and confidence. Perhaps they provided more detailed feedback on wrong answers rather than simply marking them incorrect.</p>

<p>None of this behavior was conscious or deliberate. Like the audiences unwittingly guiding Clever Hans to the right answer, teachers might be sending invisible signals that said: I believe in you. You're about to become something extraordinary.</p>

<p>And the children, reading these signals, might internalize them. A child treated as bright begins to think of herself as bright. She participates more in class. She takes on harder problems. She recovers more quickly from setbacks because she believes they're temporary obstacles on her path to blooming.</p>

<p>This is what psychologists call a self-fulfilling prophecy—a prediction that causes itself to become true by the very act of being made.</p>

<h2>The Opposite Direction</h2>

<p>The mechanism works in reverse too, and this dark mirror of the Pygmalion effect has its own mythological name: the Golem effect, after the creature from Jewish folklore—a being of clay that served its creator but could also become dangerous and destructive.</p>

<p>When teachers expect less of certain students, those students might receive fewer opportunities to speak in class, less detailed feedback, less patience when they struggle. They might be assigned to lower-level reading groups where the pace is slower and the material less challenging. They might internalize the message that they're not the kind of person who excels academically.</p>

<p>And so they don't.</p>

<p>This possibility has profound implications for how societies reproduce inequality across generations. If teachers unconsciously expect less from students who come from poor families, or from students who belong to certain racial groups, or from students who simply look less polished on the first day of school, those diminished expectations might become self-fulfilling. The students fall behind not because they lack ability, but because no one expected them to succeed.</p>

<h2>When the Clock Strikes Thirteen</h2>

<p>There's just one problem with this elegant and disturbing theory. Many researchers have tried to replicate Rosenthal and Jacobson's findings, and most of them have failed.</p>

<p>The educational psychologist Robert Thorndike published a devastating critique of the original study shortly after it appeared. The problem, Thorndike argued, was that the intelligence test used in the study was seriously flawed. In one classroom, the average "reasoning intelligence" score at the start of the year was so low that these ordinary children in an ordinary California school would have been classified as mentally disabled.</p>

<p>Thorndike quoted a colleague's memorable assessment: "When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is cast not only on the last stroke but also on all that have gone before."</p>

<p>If the initial scores were nonsensically low, the dramatic gains the researchers reported were probably just regression to the mean—a statistical phenomenon where extreme measurements tend to be followed by less extreme ones, regardless of any intervention. Students who scored improbably low the first time would naturally score higher the second time, with or without their teachers' heightened expectations.</p>

<h2>Thirty-Five Years Later</h2>

<p>A comprehensive analysis published in 2005, synthesizing thirty-five years of research on teacher expectations, reached a nuanced conclusion. Self-fulfilling prophecies in the classroom do occur. But the effects are usually small and temporary.</p>

<p>Rosenthal had originally claimed that the bloomer group gained nearly twenty-five intelligence quotient points more than the control group, and that these gains persisted over time. Subsequent research has found something much more modest: weak effects that appear in perhaps five to ten percent of students, and that tend to "reset" after a few weeks.</p>

<p>There's another complication. Teachers' expectations of their students are often accurate. A teacher who expects more from one student than another might not be engaging in self-fulfilling prophecy at all—she might simply be correctly perceiving real differences in ability, motivation, or preparation. Correlation is not causation. The fact that teacher expectations predict student performance doesn't prove that the expectations caused the performance.</p>

<h2>Beyond the Classroom</h2>

<p>While the dramatic version of the Pygmalion effect remains controversial in educational settings, researchers have found evidence for subtler expectancy effects in other contexts.</p>

<p>In 1982, psychologists conducted an experiment with the Israeli Defense Forces. They randomly selected a group of military trainees and told their instructors that these particular soldiers had been identified as having exceptional leadership potential. As in the original Oak School study, this was a lie—the soldiers had been chosen completely at random.</p>

<p>But by the end of the training program, this group outperformed the control groups on four objective tests of military competence. The adult Israeli soldiers, unlike the California schoolchildren, were unambiguously affected by their instructors' false beliefs about their potential.</p>

<p>Why might the effect work more reliably with adults in military training than with children in school? One possibility is that military trainees are highly motivated to succeed and are actively looking for signals about whether they belong. When an instructor treats a soldier as a natural leader, that soldier might adopt more leader-like behaviors almost immediately, creating a visible change that's easier to measure than the slow accumulation of academic knowledge.</p>

<h2>The Galatea Within</h2>

<p>Research on the Pygmalion effect led to an interesting discovery. Sometimes you don't need to change the authority figure's expectations at all. You can change the subordinate's expectations directly.</p>

<p>This is called the Galatea effect, named after the statue that came to life in the Pygmalion myth. In one study, researchers told trainees directly that they had been identified as high-potential individuals—never bothering to manipulate what their instructors believed. The trainees who received this message outperformed those who didn't.</p>

<p>This suggests that what matters most might not be the subtle cues sent by authority figures but rather the beliefs people hold about themselves. If you think of yourself as someone with high potential, you might work harder, persist longer through difficulties, and interpret setbacks as temporary obstacles rather than evidence of your limitations.</p>

<p>The implications are intriguing. Interventions that boost people's self-expectations directly might be more reliable—and more ethical—than trying to manipulate what authority figures believe about them.</p>

<h2>The Ethics of Expectation</h2>

<p>Speaking of ethics, there's something troubling about the traditional Pygmalion research paradigm. It requires deceiving authority figures. Managers have to be lied to by their bosses or by human resources staff. Teachers have to be given false information about their students.</p>

<p>If the deception were ever revealed, it could seriously damage trust within an organization. And the manipulation itself raises questions. Do we really want managers choosing to believe false things about their employees on the theory that false beliefs might improve performance?</p>

<p>There's also an uncomfortable gender dimension to the research. Studies have consistently failed to find Pygmalion effects for female subordinates. When researchers raised expectations about women's potential, it didn't lead to the same performance improvements seen in men. No one is entirely sure why. Perhaps the social dynamics are different when a male authority figure holds high expectations for a female subordinate. Perhaps women are less susceptible to expectancy manipulation, or perhaps they're susceptible to different kinds of signals.</p>

<h2>The Teachers Themselves</h2>

<p>One often-overlooked finding from this research tradition is that the effect works in reverse too—not from teachers to students, but from students to teachers.</p>

<p>In one experiment, researchers instructed some groups of students to appear attentive during a lesson, leaning forward, making eye contact, nodding at key points. Other groups were told to appear inattentive, looking away and slumping in their seats. Afterward, the teachers who had faced the attentive students rated their own teaching abilities significantly higher than those who had faced the inattentive ones.</p>

<p>The students had unwittingly manipulated their teachers' self-perception through nothing more than body language. A teacher who sees engaged faces believes she's teaching well. A teacher who sees bored faces begins to doubt herself.</p>

<p>This suggests that expectations form a dynamic loop, not a one-way street. Teachers and students, leaders and followers, are constantly reading each other and adjusting their behavior based on what they perceive. We are all, in some sense, Clever Hans—exquisitely sensitive to the expectations of those around us, and prone to fulfilling them.</p>

<h2>What Remains</h2>

<p>The Pygmalion effect, in its strongest form, remains unproven. The original study was methodologically flawed, and attempts to replicate its dramatic findings have largely failed. Teacher expectations probably don't have the power to raise or lower children's intelligence by twenty points.</p>

<p>But something real lurks in this research, even if it's smaller and more complicated than Rosenthal and Jacobson originally claimed. Expectations do shape behavior. Leaders who believe in their subordinates treat them differently, and subordinates notice. People who believe in themselves persist longer and try harder. The audiences watching Clever Hans did communicate the right answer through their body language, even though they didn't mean to.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most useful lesson isn't about manipulating expectations strategically but about noticing them honestly. What do you expect from the people you lead, teach, or parent? And what messages might you be sending without realizing it?</p>

<p>In the original myth, Pygmalion's love brought his statue to life. In the psychology that bears his name, the mechanism is more mundane but still remarkable: we transmit our beliefs about others through a thousand tiny signals, and those beliefs, received and internalized, can sometimes become true.</p>

<p>The statue doesn't literally come to life. But it doesn't have to. The sculptor's expectation changes his behavior, which changes the statue's behavior, which confirms the expectation. The prophecy fulfills itself, one small signal at a time.</p>
