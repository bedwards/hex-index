<h2>The School Where Children Run Everything</h2>

<p>Imagine a school with no grades. No tests. No required classes. No curriculum at all.</p>

<p>Now imagine that same school is governed by a democratic assembly where a six-year-old's vote carries exactly the same weight as an adult staff member's. Where children can spend their entire day playing video games if they choose—and no one will stop them. Where a teenager might not learn to read until age twelve, and that's considered perfectly fine.</p>

<p>This isn't a thought experiment. It's a real educational model that has been operating since 1968, and today there are more than sixty such schools scattered across the globe. They're called Sudbury schools, and they represent one of the most radical departures from conventional education ever attempted.</p>

<h2>What Actually Happens Inside</h2>

<p>Walk into a Sudbury school for the first time, and you might think you've stumbled into an eternal recess. Children of all ages mill about freely. Some cluster around computers. Others sprawl on couches reading. A group plays an elaborate outdoor game. Two teenagers are deep in conversation with an adult about philosophy. A seven-year-old is alone, building something intricate with blocks.</p>

<p>No bells ring. No one shuffles between classes. There are no classes—at least not in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>The adults present aren't called teachers. They're simply "staff." They don't instruct unless asked. They don't direct activities. They don't evaluate progress. They exist primarily as resources, available if a student wants to learn something specific, but never imposing their agenda on anyone.</p>

<p>This can be deeply unsettling to observe. Where's the structure? Where's the learning? How will these children ever succeed in the real world?</p>

<p>The Sudbury philosophy has answers to all these questions, though they challenge nearly everything we assume about how education should work.</p>

<h2>The Radical Premise</h2>

<p>At its core, the Sudbury model rests on two foundational beliefs that diverge sharply from mainstream educational thought.</p>

<p>The first is about learning itself. Sudbury proponents argue that children are naturally equipped with exactly the traits they need to become capable adults: curiosity, creativity, imagination, alertness, thoughtfulness, responsibility, and judgment. These aren't skills that need to be taught. They're innate. What children lack isn't ability—it's experience. And experience, the thinking goes, cannot be efficiently transmitted through formal instruction. It must be lived.</p>

<p>The second belief is political. If we want adults who can function comfortably in a democracy, the best preparation is to give children full democratic rights from the start. Not simulated democracy, not student government as a feel-good exercise with no real power. Actual democracy, where children genuinely govern their own community.</p>

<p>These two ideas—that learning happens naturally through living, and that children deserve real political power—combine to create something unlike any conventional school.</p>

<h2>Democracy in Action</h2>

<p>Every week, the entire school community gathers for School Meeting. This assembly, modeled on the traditional New England town meeting, is the supreme governing body of the school. It passes laws. It manages the budget. It hires and fires staff.</p>

<p>Here's what makes it revolutionary: every person present gets one vote. A five-year-old votes. A seventeen-year-old votes. A staff member with twenty years of experience votes. All equal. Most decisions pass by simple majority.</p>

<p>This isn't ceremonial. The school meeting has real teeth.</p>

<p>Staff members serve at the pleasure of the school meeting. Their contracts typically must be renewed annually, and the entire community—children included—votes on whether to keep them. An unpopular staff member can be dismissed. A popular one can be retained. The children aren't advisors or stakeholders whose input is considered. They're citizens with full franchise.</p>

<p>The school meeting also handles discipline. Most Sudbury schools have developed elaborate judicial systems, complete with investigations, hearings, trials, and appeals. When someone breaks a school rule—and there are rules, democratically established ones—a judicial committee investigates. The accused has rights. Due process matters. Consequences are determined by peers, not imposed by adults.</p>

<p>These rules get compiled into a law book, a living document that evolves over time as the community amends its own code. It's not unusual for the law book at a long-established Sudbury school to run to dozens of pages, the accumulated wisdom of generations of students working out how to live together.</p>

<h2>Learning Without Teaching</h2>

<p>Perhaps nothing about Sudbury schools bewilders outsiders more than the approach to reading.</p>

<p>In conventional schools, reading instruction begins in kindergarten or first grade, following carefully sequenced curricula. Phonics, sight words, reading levels, comprehension strategies—the machinery of literacy education is vast and detailed. Reading is treated as the gateway skill, the one thing you absolutely must learn early or risk falling hopelessly behind.</p>

<p>Sudbury schools don't teach reading at all. Not formally. Not at any particular age. Children learn to read when they're ready, through whatever method works for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Only a few kids seek any help at all when they decide to learn. Each child seems to have their own method. Some learn from being read to, memorizing the stories and then ultimately reading them. Some learn from cereal boxes, others from game instructions, others from street signs. Some teach themselves letter sounds, others syllables, others whole words. To be honest, we rarely know how they do it, and they rarely tell us."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ages at which Sudbury students become literate vary wildly. Some read at four. Others not until eleven or twelve. The school's claim—and it's a remarkable one—is that by the time students are older, you cannot tell who learned early and who learned late. The late readers don't show deficits. They didn't need those extra years of instruction; they just needed to be ready.</p>

<p>This approach applies to everything. Mathematics. History. Science. Music. Whatever a student wants to learn, they pursue. Whatever they don't want to learn, they don't. Some students spend years focused intensely on a single passion. Others flit between interests. Some seem to do nothing but play for long stretches—and that's allowed, because play itself is considered a valid form of learning.</p>

<h2>The Age-Mixing Experiment</h2>

<p>One feature of Sudbury schools gets less attention than it deserves: the radical mixing of ages.</p>

<p>Conventional schools segregate ruthlessly by age. First-graders with first-graders. Eighth-graders with eighth-graders. The assumption is that children at similar developmental stages learn best together, with age-appropriate content delivered at age-appropriate levels.</p>

<p>Sudbury schools reject this entirely. A four-year-old might spend her day trailing a group of twelve-year-olds. A teenager might mentor a seven-year-old in chess. The boundaries dissolve.</p>

<p>The theory is that this mixing benefits everyone. Younger children gain role models—and not all those role models are positive, which is itself considered educational. They see what adolescence actually looks like, in all its complexity. They learn to navigate relationships with people at different life stages, just as they'll need to do throughout adulthood.</p>

<p>Older students, meanwhile, consolidate their own knowledge by explaining things to younger ones. They also learn responsibility and develop empathy across age gaps. They're not isolated in the hothouse of same-age peer pressure that dominates conventional high schools.</p>

<h2>The Philosophical Roots</h2>

<p>The first Sudbury school opened in Framingham, Massachusetts in 1968, near the town of Sudbury—hence the name. Daniel Greenberg, one of its founders, articulated the philosophy that would guide the movement.</p>

<p>Greenberg identified two essential features that define a true Sudbury school. First: everyone is treated equally, adults and children together. Not in a patronizing "we value your input" way, but in a literal structural sense where children have the same rights and powers as adults within the school community. Second: there is no authority except that granted by consent of the governed. No one gets to tell anyone else what to do simply by virtue of age or position.</p>

<p>These principles connect to a long tradition of radical educational thought, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's belief in the natural goodness of children to A.S. Neill's Summerhill School, which pioneered democratic education in England starting in 1921. But Sudbury schools push the ideas further than most predecessors, particularly in their insistence on genuine political equality between children and adults.</p>

<h2>What Sudbury Is Not</h2>

<p>It helps to understand Sudbury schools by contrasting them with what they're not.</p>

<p>They're not Montessori schools. Maria Montessori's approach, while child-centered, still involves carefully prepared environments, specific learning materials, and trained teachers who guide children through a structured progression. Montessori teachers observe and redirect. Sudbury staff don't.</p>

<p>They're not unschooling, exactly, though they share DNA. Unschooling typically happens within families, with parents facilitating their children's self-directed learning. Sudbury schools create a community setting with the same philosophy, but the community—not parents—governs.</p>

<p>They're not "free schools" in the general sense, though they're often grouped with them. Many free schools give children freedom within certain boundaries set by adults. Sudbury schools give children the power to set the boundaries themselves.</p>

<p>They're certainly not progressive schools in the John Dewey tradition. Dewey wanted education connected to real-world problems and community needs, but still saw a crucial role for expert teachers designing meaningful experiences. Sudbury schools eliminate that role entirely.</p>

<h2>The Critics and the Questions</h2>

<p>The Sudbury model has never become mainstream, and it's not hard to see why it generates skepticism.</p>

<p>What about children who never develop motivation to learn academic subjects? The Sudbury answer is essentially that they'll learn what they need when they need it—but critics worry this leaves gaps. A child who spends years avoiding math might find certain career paths closed off. Is that acceptable if the child chose it freely?</p>

<p>What about college admission? Students from Sudbury schools typically don't have transcripts, grades, or standardized test preparation. They have to make their case through portfolios, essays, and interviews. Some succeed spectacularly at elite institutions. Others find the system simply doesn't accommodate them.</p>

<p>What about children who would thrive with more structure? Not every child wants radical freedom. Some genuinely prefer being told what to do, at least some of the time. The Sudbury response is that such children will create structure for themselves, or find it within the community. Critics wonder if that's always true.</p>

<p>And the deepest question: does childhood democracy really prepare children for adult democracy? Or does it create false expectations about how the world works? Most workplaces are not democracies. Most institutions have hierarchies. Is it kind to raise children in a radically egalitarian environment when they'll eventually have to navigate a world that isn't?</p>

<h2>The Global Experiment Continues</h2>

<p>Today, more than sixty schools worldwide identify themselves as Sudbury schools. They operate on every inhabited continent. Each is independent—there's no central organization, no accreditation body, no official Sudbury seal of approval. Any school can call itself a Sudbury school if it adheres to the basic principles.</p>

<p>This decentralization is itself philosophically consistent. A movement built on local democratic control shouldn't have a central authority dictating terms.</p>

<p>Some of these schools have operated for decades, accumulating graduates who've gone on to every imaginable career path. Others are young, still finding their way. The model remains a small minority within education, far outside the mainstream, but it persists. New schools still open. Parents still choose it for their children. Young people still grow up within it.</p>

<p>Whether the Sudbury model represents the future of education or an interesting dead end depends largely on what you believe about human nature. If you believe children are naturally driven to learn, that curiosity and motivation don't need to be instilled but merely protected, then Sudbury makes sense. The structured schools are the aberration, forcing children into unnatural patterns that suppress their innate drive to grow.</p>

<p>If you believe that learning important things is often difficult and unappealing, that children need guidance and sometimes compulsion to acquire essential skills, then Sudbury looks like a beautiful dream that ignores hard realities. Freedom is wonderful, but so is competence—and maybe competence sometimes requires doing things you wouldn't freely choose.</p>

<p>The Sudbury schools have been running their experiment for more than half a century now. The debate over what the results mean continues.</p>
