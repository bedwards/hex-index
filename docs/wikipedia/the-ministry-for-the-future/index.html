        I've prepared a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article about "The Ministry for the Future" as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the powerful hook of the novel's devastating heat wave scene rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph lengths significantly (from single punchy sentences to longer explanatory sections)
- Explains complex concepts like carbon quantitative easing, wet-bulb temperature, and basal sliding from first principles
- Includes interesting connections (Obama's book list, the COVID-19 parallel, Jameson's famous quote)
- Flows naturally as a narrative essay while remaining substantive (~2,200 words, roughly 11-15 minutes of reading)
- Uses clean semantic HTML with proper headings, paragraphs, and emphasis

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/the-ministry-for-the-future/index.html` once permission is granted.
