        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article about the Department of Government Efficiency. The article transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

Key elements of the rewrite:

1. **Strong opening hook** - Starts with the dramatic premise of "the world's richest person" being given unprecedented access to federal government systems

2. **Varied paragraph and sentence lengths** - Creates rhythm for audio listening with short punchy paragraphs mixed with longer explanatory ones

3. **Spelled out acronyms** - DOGE, USDS, GSA, IRS, etc. are all explained on first use

4. **Plain language explanations** - Technical concepts like the Appointments Clause are explained in context

5. **Historical connections** - Draws parallels to the Gilded Age, Argentina's Milei administration, and historical efficiency commissions

6. **Narrative flow** - The essay follows a chronological arc from the idea's origin through DOGE's creation, activities, controversies, and eventual dissolution

7. **Multiple perspectives** - Presents three different interpretations of what DOGE represented without advocating for any single view

8. **Substantive content** - Approximately 25 minutes of reading material covering all major aspects of the topic

The file is ready to write to `docs/wikipedia/department-of-government-efficiency/index.html` - I just need the write permission to be granted.
