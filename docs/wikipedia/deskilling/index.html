<p>In 2025, doctors in Poland made a troubling discovery. After months of using an artificial intelligence system to help them spot polyps during colonoscopies, their own detection rates had quietly collapsed. Before the AI arrived, these endoscopists caught adenomas—the precancerous growths they were hunting—about 28 percent of the time. After becoming accustomed to the machine's assistance, their unassisted rate dropped to just over 22 percent. The technology meant to enhance their abilities had instead eroded them.</p>

<p>This is deskilling in its most insidious modern form. But the phenomenon is far older than any algorithm.</p>

<h2>When Machines Replace Mastery</h2>

<p>Deskilling happens when technology or economic restructuring eliminates the need for skilled labor, replacing experienced workers with cheaper, less trained alternatives—or with no workers at all. The concept sounds abstract until you watch it unfold. A master craftsman who once shaped wood by hand and eye finds his workshop replaced by a computer-controlled router operated by someone who learned the job in an afternoon. A paralegal who spent years learning to research case law discovers that a database search does in seconds what once took her days.</p>

<p>The consequences ripple outward. When you need less skill to do a job, you can pay workers less. You have more people to choose from when hiring. The workers who remain have less bargaining power—after all, they're more easily replaced. Companies save money on training and wages. But something is also lost.</p>

<p>The term "deskilling" applies in two distinct ways, and understanding both matters. The first is structural: an entire industry transforms so that jobs once requiring extensive training now require little. The second is personal: an individual worker becomes less capable over time, their hard-won abilities rusting from disuse.</p>

<p>Consider a skilled accountant who loses her position and spends three years working as a cashier. The financial modeling techniques she once wielded instinctively grow foggy. The tax code changes while she's away from it. When she finally returns to accounting—if she can—she's not the professional she was. Or consider the immigrant surgeon who cannot get his medical credentials recognized in his new country and spends a decade driving a taxi. His hands forget the movements they once knew.</p>

<h2>The Loom and the Luddites</h2>

<p>The story of deskilling begins, like so many economic stories, with the Industrial Revolution in late eighteenth-century England. Before the power loom, weaving was a skilled trade. A competent weaver spent years as an apprentice, learning to read the fabric, maintain the tension, and produce consistent work. The handloom weavers were artisans. They controlled their own time, often working from home. They had standing in their communities.</p>

<p>Then came the factories.</p>

<p>The new mechanical looms didn't require artisans. They required attendants—people who could watch the machine, clear jams, and replace bobbins. Children could do this work. And they did, for wages a fraction of what the skilled weavers had earned. The weavers didn't simply lose their jobs; they watched their craft become irrelevant. The years they had invested in developing their abilities were suddenly worthless.</p>

<p>This transformation sparked the Luddite uprising of 1811-1816, when groups of workers destroyed machinery across England's textile districts. We use "Luddite" today as an insult meaning someone irrationally opposed to technology. But the original Luddites weren't irrational. They understood exactly what was happening: technology was being deployed specifically to replace them with cheaper labor. Their skills were being engineered out of existence.</p>

<p>Economists and philosophers took opposing positions on whether this was intentional or incidental—a debate that continues today.</p>

<h2>Marx, Smith, and the Great Debate</h2>

<p>Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, and Karl Marx, his most famous critic, rarely agreed on anything. But they shared a suspicion about deskilling. Both believed that technological development had what we might call a "deskilling bias"—that innovations tended to simplify work, replacing skilled labor with unskilled labor, concentrating the benefits among factory owners and investors.</p>

<p>Marx saw this as a weapon. In his analysis, the capitalist class used technology deliberately to weaken workers. By breaking complex jobs into simple tasks, factory owners stripped workers of their power. A craftsman who understood an entire process had leverage. A worker who performed one repetitive motion had none. The minute division of labor wasn't just efficient; it was a tool of class warfare.</p>

<p>This view holds that deskilling isn't an unfortunate side effect of progress—it's the point. Investors don't adopt new technology primarily to make better products. They adopt it to reduce labor costs and increase their control over the production process. Skilled workers are expensive and independent. Deskilled workers are cheap and replaceable.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage, the Victorian mathematician who designed early mechanical computers, offered a counter-argument that remains influential among pro-business economists today. In his view, technological change creates new opportunities for workers to learn new skills. The old jobs disappear, yes, but new jobs emerge. The overall effect is neutral or even positive for workers.</p>

<p>This "neoliberal" position treats deskilling as an unintended byproduct rather than a deliberate strategy. Markets naturally create opportunities, and workers who adapt will prosper. The economy isn't a zero-sum game where owners win only when workers lose.</p>

<p>Which view is correct? The historical evidence refuses to pick a side.</p>

<h2>What the Numbers Actually Show</h2>

<p>Economic historians have spent decades trying to determine whether the Industrial Revolution actually deskilled the British workforce. The results are frustratingly ambiguous.</p>

<p>By the mid-1800s, skilled workers—both highly skilled and modestly skilled—made up over 60 percent of the English and Welsh workforce. This sounds like evidence against deskilling, until you notice what the statistic doesn't tell us. It doesn't distinguish between truly skilled positions and jobs merely classified as "skilled" for bureaucratic purposes. More importantly, it doesn't track what happened to individual workers.</p>

<p>The share of unskilled workers did grow dramatically, from about 20 percent in 1700 to 39 percent by 1850. But this doesn't necessarily mean skilled workers were being deskilled. The Industrial Revolution created enormous numbers of new jobs, drawing in workers who had never held skilled positions: women, children, rural migrants. These weren't deskilled workers; they were newly employed workers who had never been skilled in the first place.</p>

<p>The same period saw growth in apprenticeships and literacy, suggesting that some workers were gaining skills even as others lost them. The most honest assessment is that the Industrial Revolution produced a complex mixture of deskilling, upskilling, and lateral movement—not a clean narrative in either direction.</p>

<h2>The Seventies Crisis</h2>

<p>The deskilling debate resurfaced with new urgency during the economic turbulence of the 1970s. After decades of post-World War II prosperity, the United States suddenly faced stagflation, oil shocks, and the first major recession since the Great Depression. Workers who had assumed their jobs were secure discovered otherwise.</p>

<p>Harry Braverman, a Marxist scholar and former metalworker, published "Labor and Monopoly Capital" in 1974, and it became enormously influential. Braverman argued that twentieth-century capitalism was systematically degrading work. The new middle class that had emerged—office workers, technicians, service employees—weren't really better off than the industrial workers they replaced. They were "reskilled," perhaps, trained in new tasks, but the work itself had become more fragmented, more controlled, less fulfilling.</p>

<p>Braverman worried that monopoly capitalism would progressively squeeze the middle class. As companies consolidated and automated, they would need fewer skilled workers. The comfortable stability that characterized post-war employment was an anomaly, not a permanent condition.</p>

<p>Andre Gorz, a French social philosopher, went further in his 1982 book "Farewell to the Working Class." Gorz claimed the traditional working class had essentially ceased to exist. Technological change had created what he called a "non-class of non-workers"—people who were employed, technically, but so disconnected from meaningful production that the old categories no longer applied. They weren't being deskilled so much as rendered irrelevant.</p>

<p>Braverman disputed this interpretation. The unemployment and alienation Gorz described were real, he acknowledged, but they represented a transitional phase, not a permanent condition. Capitalism was decomposing and recomposing the working class, not eliminating it. This was consistent with Marx's observation that capitalism constantly revolutionizes the means of production, destroying and creating in the same motion.</p>

<h2>When White Collars Fray</h2>

<p>For most of industrial history, deskilling primarily affected blue-collar workers—people who worked with their hands, in factories and farms and mines. Professionals were largely immune. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, and pilots required extensive training and possessed knowledge that couldn't easily be automated. Their positions seemed secure.</p>

<p>The twenty-first century changed that.</p>

<p>Consider the modern paralegal. Twenty years ago, legal research required years of training. You needed to know how case law was organized, how to navigate physical law libraries, how to find relevant precedents among millions of published decisions. Junior attorneys spent years developing this expertise before becoming truly productive.</p>

<p>Then came searchable legal databases. Now someone with minimal training can find relevant cases in minutes. The expertise that once took years to develop is embedded in the software. Law firms responded predictably: they hired fewer highly trained researchers and more people to operate the databases. The work got done faster and cheaper, but the jobs that remained required less skill and commanded lower pay.</p>

<p>This pattern—a profession's core knowledge becoming embedded in software that less skilled workers can operate—has played out across white-collar industries. The process has a name: deprofessionalization.</p>

<h2>Teachers, Pilots, and the Automation Paradox</h2>

<p>Teaching would seem resistant to deskilling. The core of the work—communicating with students, adapting to their needs, inspiring engagement—requires human judgment and interpersonal skill. You can't automate a good teacher.</p>

<p>But you can constrain one.</p>

<p>Standardized curricula, centralized testing regimes, and the proliferation of educational technology have transformed what teachers actually do. In the United States, national and state standards specify exactly what should be taught and when. Textbooks and lesson plans are chosen at the district level. Teachers increasingly execute a predetermined program rather than exercising professional judgment.</p>

<p>Researchers describe this as "proletarianization"—historically a working-class condition—reaching professional workers. Teachers are expected to fulfill a wider range of functions while their actual decision-making authority shrinks. Their range of knowledge and skill becomes "routinized," less like a craft and more like following instructions.</p>

<p>Scandinavian countries recognized this threat decades ago. Beginning in the 1950s, trade unions in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark pushed for "codetermination legislation"—laws giving workers a voice in how technology would be implemented in their workplaces. These laws didn't prevent automation but ensured workers could negotiate how it affected their roles. The goal was to capture the benefits of technology while preserving the skill and autonomy that make work meaningful.</p>

<p>Commercial aviation presents perhaps the starkest example of professional deskilling. Modern jets essentially fly themselves. Autopilot systems handle takeoff, cruising, and landing. Pilots spend most of each flight monitoring instruments rather than actively controlling the aircraft. This is vastly safer than manual flight—automated systems don't get tired, don't get distracted, don't make the small errors that cause crashes.</p>

<p>But there's a troubling catch.</p>

<p>Studies consistently find that pilots who rely heavily on autopilot become worse at flying manually. Their skills atrophy. The problem becomes acute during emergencies, precisely the moments when manual skill matters most. A pilot who hasn't genuinely flown in months suddenly faces a system failure and must take over controls their hands have forgotten. Several fatal crashes have been attributed to this dynamic—pilots unable to cope when automation failed because automation had deskilled them.</p>

<p>This is the automation paradox: the more reliable the technology, the less skilled the humans overseeing it become, and the worse they perform when the technology fails.</p>

<h2>Brexit and the Economics of Shock</h2>

<p>Not all deskilling stems from technology. Sometimes it comes from political and economic disruption.</p>

<p>When the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, supporters expected various benefits: reduced immigration, restored sovereignty, new trade flexibility. What actually followed was more complicated.</p>

<p>The immediate aftermath brought economic uncertainty. The pound sterling fell sharply. Trade relationships that had been stable for decades suddenly required renegotiation. Companies that relied on European suppliers faced unpredictable costs. Investment decisions were delayed as businesses waited to see what the new rules would be.</p>

<p>The labor market felt these effects directly. When companies face uncertainty, they reduce training investments—why develop workers' skills when you might need to lay them off? Apprenticeship offerings declined. Workers who might have advanced found their development stalled. This wasn't technology replacing workers; it was economic chaos preventing workers from gaining skills in the first place.</p>

<p>More subtly, industries that depended on imported components faced deskilling pressures. When your supply chain is disrupted, you can't produce your usual products, so you can't use your usual skills. Workers in these industries found their capabilities rusting, not because machines replaced them but because the machines sat idle.</p>

<p>Economists worry about long-term effects. Skills lost during disruption don't automatically return when stability does. A generation of workers whose development was interrupted may carry that deficit for decades. When new trade agreements eventually emerge, British industry may find itself less capable than it was before the break—not because of any deliberate deskilling strategy, but because of years of enforced stagnation.</p>

<h2>Deskilling the Audience</h2>

<p>The concept extends beyond economics into unexpected domains. Art theorist Benjamin Buchloh argues that deskilling was a deliberate strategy in twentieth-century art—an intentional rejection of "artisanal competence and manual virtuosity."</p>

<p>This might sound strange. We typically value skill in artists. We admire the technique of Renaissance masters, the draftsmanship of classical painters. But movements like Dadaism, conceptual art, and much of contemporary art explicitly rejected technical virtuosity. Marcel Duchamp's famous urinal—submitted to an art exhibition as "Fountain"—required no artistic skill to create. That was the point.</p>

<p>These artists weren't being deskilled against their will. They were deliberately deskilling their practice, arguing that conceptual novelty mattered more than execution, that the idea was the art. But the parallel to industrial deskilling is striking: in both cases, the accumulated expertise of practitioners is declared irrelevant, replaced by something simpler.</p>

<h2>What We Lose When Work Loses Meaning</h2>

<p>Work occupies most of modern adult life. Beyond its economic function—providing income, producing goods and services—it serves psychological and social purposes. Work gives people structure, identity, community, purpose. The question of whether work is "meaningful" isn't a luxury concern; it's central to human wellbeing.</p>

<p>Deskilling threatens meaning in several ways. When work becomes simplified and routinized, it loses the elements that make it engaging: the challenge of mastering a craft, the satisfaction of solving problems, the pride of producing something well. A worker who once exercised judgment now follows procedures. An artisan becomes an operator.</p>

<p>The wage effects matter too, obviously. When your skills are devalued, your compensation drops. But the meaning effects may cut deeper. Studies of worker wellbeing consistently find that autonomy, mastery, and purpose matter as much as income—sometimes more. Deskilling attacks all three simultaneously.</p>

<p>There's also the insecurity. In a world where skills are constantly being automated away, how can workers feel confident about their futures? The job you trained for might not exist in ten years. The expertise you developed might become worthless. This uncertainty itself is corrosive, creating anxiety even among workers whose jobs haven't yet been affected.</p>

<h2>Can We Still Create Skills?</h2>

<p>The pattern seems relentless: technology advances, jobs simplify, workers lose power. But the historical record offers some hope.</p>

<p>New technologies don't just destroy skills; they create demands for new ones. The automobile eliminated jobs for farriers and stable hands but created jobs for mechanics and engineers. Computers eliminated typing pools but created demands for programmers and network administrators. The question isn't whether skill destruction happens—it clearly does—but whether skill creation keeps pace.</p>

<p>The optimistic view holds that it does, eventually. Labor markets adjust. Workers retrain. New industries emerge. The craftsmen displaced by factories became the machinists who ran them. The switchboard operators replaced by automatic routing became the technicians who maintained the networks.</p>

<p>The pessimistic view notes that "eventually" can be a long time, and the workers displaced often aren't the ones who benefit from new opportunities. The handloom weavers didn't become factory owners. The taxi drivers being replaced by ride-sharing apps won't become software engineers. Transitions are painful, sometimes permanently so for the individuals caught in them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most honest view is that outcomes depend on choices—political, economic, and social. Countries that invest in worker training, that give workers voice in how technology is implemented, that maintain robust social insurance, can shape technological change rather than simply suffering it. The Scandinavian approach, with its codetermination legislation and active labor market policies, shows one path. Countries that treat workers as pure costs to be minimized show another.</p>

<p>Technology itself is neutral. The question is who controls it and for whose benefit.</p>

<h2>The AI Moment</h2>

<p>We return to those Polish doctors and their declining abilities. The colonoscopy study crystallizes something that workers across industries are beginning to experience: artificial intelligence doesn't just do our work for us; it may make us worse at doing it ourselves.</p>

<p>The dynamic is subtle. When AI handles routine cases, humans lose practice with routine cases. When AI makes recommendations, humans stop developing the judgment to make their own. When AI catches errors, humans stop being vigilant. The skills migrate from person to machine, and they don't easily migrate back.</p>

<p>Previous waves of automation primarily affected procedural skills—the ability to execute defined tasks. AI threatens cognitive skills—the ability to analyze, judge, and decide. A radiologist who always defers to AI interpretation may gradually lose the ability to read scans independently. A lawyer who relies on AI research may forget how to think through legal problems. A writer whose AI assistant handles first drafts may find their own voice atrophying.</p>

<p>This isn't hypothetical. The copywriters and content creators whose stories prompted this discussion report exactly this experience. They used AI tools as directed by their employers, and over time they felt their own capabilities diminishing. Then the layoffs came, and they found themselves less capable than when they started.</p>

<p>Whether this represents a temporary adjustment or a permanent transformation remains unclear. But the question itself—what happens to human capability when machines become capable—may be the defining challenge of the coming decades.</p>

<p>The answers we choose will shape what work means, and what we mean, for generations to come.</p>
