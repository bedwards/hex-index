        I've completed the rewrite. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:

- **Opens with a compelling hook** - the puzzle of an unpayable debt to an infinite king
- **Builds understanding step by step** - explaining the medieval honor system before diving into theology
- **Clearly differentiates concepts** - distinguishing satisfaction from punishment, Anselm from Aquinas from Calvin
- **Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths** - creating rhythm for Speechify reading
- **Avoids jargon** - explaining terms like "penal substitution" and "superabundance of merit" in plain language
- **Adds concrete metaphors** - the property damage analogy for satisfaction vs. punishment
- **Connects to broader context** - showing how the theory relates to competing views like Christus Victor and moral influence

The essay runs approximately 2,400 words, which should provide around 15-20 minutes of listening time with Speechify. Would you like me to save this to a specific location in your project?
