<h2>The Hidden Slack in the Global Economy</h2>

<p>Here's a puzzle that economists have wrestled with for decades: factories around the world routinely operate at only 80 percent of their potential. Not because they're broken. Not because workers are slacking. But because, apparently, running at full tilt is neither desirable nor sustainable.</p>

<p>This phenomenon—capacity utilization—reveals something profound about how modern economies actually function, as opposed to how we imagine they should.</p>

<h2>What Capacity Utilization Actually Measures</h2>

<p>At its simplest, capacity utilization is the ratio between what a factory, industry, or entire economy actually produces versus what it could produce if everything ran at maximum output. Think of it like the fuel efficiency display in a car: it tells you how much of your engine's potential you're actually using.</p>

<p>But defining "maximum output" turns out to be surprisingly contentious.</p>

<p>Engineers take the straightforward approach. Maximum output means exactly that—the absolute physical limit of what your machines can churn out in a given time period. If your bottling plant can theoretically fill 10,000 bottles per hour when running flat out, that's your capacity.</p>

<p>Economists see it differently. They're more interested in the point where costs start climbing uncomfortably. Running a factory 24 hours a day with emergency overtime might technically be possible, but it's expensive. Equipment breaks down more often. Workers make more mistakes. Quality suffers.</p>

<p>So the "economic" definition of capacity asks: at what level of output can we operate without our per-unit costs starting to creep upward? This typically yields a utilization rate about 10 percentage points higher than the engineering measure—meaning when engineers say you're at 75 percent capacity, economists might call it 85 percent. Both are measuring something real, just something different.</p>

<h2>The Magic Numbers: 82 to 85 Percent</h2>

<p>Central bankers and inflation watchers pay close attention to capacity utilization for a specific reason. There appears to be a threshold—somewhere between 82 and 85 percent utilization—above which inflation pressures start to build.</p>

<p>The logic is intuitive. When factories are running near their limits, adding more production becomes expensive. Companies start competing more fiercely for scarce inputs—specialized workers, raw materials, machine time at suppliers. Prices rise. Workers, sensing their bargaining power, demand higher wages. Those costs get passed along to consumers.</p>

<p>Below that threshold, there's slack in the system. Companies can ramp up production relatively easily without costs spiraling. An unemployed worker is happy to take a job at the going rate. A supplier with idle machines will give you a good deal to keep them running.</p>

<p>This is why bond traders obsess over capacity utilization data. Higher utilization suggests future inflation, which erodes the real value of fixed-interest payments. When utilization ticks up, bond prices often tick down.</p>

<h2>The Chronic Surplus Problem</h2>

<p>Here's where things get interesting—and politically charged.</p>

<p>If you average out the United States economy since 1967, capacity utilization has hovered around 81.6 percent. Europe is similar. Japan runs slightly higher, but not by much. This means that roughly one-fifth of the developed world's productive potential sits idle in any given year.</p>

<p>To critics of market capitalism, this represents a colossal inefficiency. All those factories, all that equipment, all those potential jobs—sitting unused while people lack goods they need and want. If only purchasing power were distributed differently, the argument goes, we could run closer to full capacity and everyone would be better off.</p>

<p>Defenders of the system counter that some slack is necessary and healthy. Economies need room to respond to sudden increases in demand. Running at 100 percent capacity is like running at 100 percent of your maximum heart rate—possible briefly, but unsustainable and dangerous over time.</p>

<p>The truth likely lies somewhere in between, and varies dramatically by industry and country.</p>

<h2>Measuring the Unmeasurable</h2>

<p>Collecting capacity utilization data is harder than it sounds. The United States Federal Reserve Board surveys manufacturing plants directly, asking a deceptively complex question: "What is the maximum level of production that this establishment could reasonably expect to attain under normal and realistic operating conditions, fully utilizing the machinery and equipment in place?"</p>

<p>Notice the qualifiers piled up in that sentence. "Reasonably expect." "Normal and realistic." These are judgment calls, not measurements. Different plant managers will interpret them differently.</p>

<p>The Institute for Supply Management takes another approach, asking companies to compare their current output to "normal capacity." This yields rates four to ten percentage points higher than the Federal Reserve measure. Both track the same trends over time—they rise and fall together—but they're calibrated to different baselines.</p>

<p>Service industries present an even thornier problem. How do you measure the capacity of a law firm? A restaurant? A software company? The concept was developed for factories with countable widgets rolling off assembly lines. It maps poorly onto an economy increasingly dominated by services.</p>

<h2>The Great Scrapping of the Early 1980s</h2>

<p>Economist Michael Perelman identified a fascinating shift in how we should interpret capacity utilization data. Before the early 1980s, American businesses carried substantial extra capacity—old, inefficient plants kept on standby for demand surges. Back then, hitting 80 percent capacity really did mean you were pushing against practical limits.</p>

<p>Then came the recession and restructuring of the early Reagan years. Companies ruthlessly scrapped their oldest, least efficient facilities. What remained was leaner and more productive.</p>

<p>The consequence? Modern capacity utilization readings aren't directly comparable to historical ones. When today's Federal Reserve data shows 77 percent utilization, it may be functionally equivalent to 70 percent in the 1970s. The remaining capacity is all high-quality capacity. Less slack exists than the raw numbers suggest.</p>

<h2>A Global Snapshot</h2>

<p>Capacity utilization varies significantly across countries, reflecting different economic structures, policies, and stages of development.</p>

<p>The developed economies cluster in a relatively narrow band. The United States typically runs around 79 to 80 percent. The European Union is similar at roughly 82 percent. Japan tends slightly higher at 83 to 86 percent, perhaps reflecting tighter integration between production planning and market demand. Canada occasionally pushes up to 87 percent.</p>

<p>Emerging economies show more variation and often lower rates. Brazil has historically oscillated between 60 and 80 percent—a wide band reflecting political and economic instability. India runs around 70 percent. China, despite its reputation as the workshop of the world, may operate at only 60 percent capacity in many industries.</p>

<p>That last point deserves emphasis. China's chronic overcapacity has become a major issue in global trade discussions. When Chinese steel mills, solar panel factories, or electric vehicle plants operate at 60 percent capacity, they often dump excess production onto world markets at prices domestic competitors can't match. The Chinese government has increasingly acknowledged this problem, though the preferred terminology has shifted. In recent years, officials have taken to calling it "involution"—a term suggesting industries competing themselves into mutual exhaustion—rather than the more clinical "overcapacity."</p>

<h2>The Business Cycle Connection</h2>

<p>Capacity utilization fluctuates with economic cycles in predictable ways. During expansions, as demand grows, factories run closer to their limits. During recessions, demand falls and utilization drops.</p>

<p>This seems obvious, but economists Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman demonstrated in 1988 that taking capacity utilization seriously in economic models helps explain several puzzling features of business cycles. When investment spending surges, companies don't just buy more equipment—they also work their existing equipment harder. Ignoring this second effect leads models to underestimate how volatile output actually is.</p>

<p>The "output gap"—the difference between actual economic output and what the economy could produce at full capacity—has become a key metric for central banks. A large negative gap, with actual output well below potential, suggests room for stimulus without triggering inflation. A positive gap, with the economy running hot, signals danger ahead.</p>

<h2>Why Full Capacity Is a Mirage</h2>

<p>Understanding capacity utilization helps explain why economic reality never matches the tidy models in textbooks. Perfect efficiency is neither achievable nor desirable.</p>

<p>Some slack in the system serves as insurance against demand surges. Some allows for maintenance and upgrading. Some simply reflects the reality that not every product finds a buyer, not every machine runs perfectly, and not every worker shows up healthy every day.</p>

<p>The roughly 20 percent of unused capacity in developed economies isn't waste, exactly. It's breathing room. It's optionality. It's the difference between a system that can absorb shocks and one that shatters at the first unexpected stress.</p>

<p>But it's also, unavoidably, a measure of unmet human needs beside idle productive capacity. The factory that could make more sits quiet while people who would buy more lack the means to do so. That tension—between systemic resilience and human welfare—sits at the heart of every argument about economic policy.</p>

<p>Capacity utilization, that dry-sounding statistic, turns out to measure something philosophically profound: the gap between what we could do and what we actually choose to do. And that gap, for better or worse, is where economics becomes politics.</p>
