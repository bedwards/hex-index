        I've written a complete essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on intermodal freight transport. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the transformative insight of containerization
- Traces the history from 18th century coal tubs through modern standardization
- Explains technical concepts (TEUs, double-stacking, drayage) from first principles
- Covers the machinery, security challenges, and cargo securing
- Discusses ships, canals, and narrow gauge limitations
- Concludes with the economic impact of containerization
