        I've written a comprehensive essay on Progressive Christianity, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook (the 1898 last will and testament)
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Explains theological concepts from first principles
- Draws connections between liberal Christianity, postmodernism, and various theological movements
- Covers the civil rights connection, the "epic of evolution," and tensions at the movement's edges
- Addresses criticisms and challenges the movement faces
- Ends with a return to the prophetic tradition

The HTML is ready with semantic markup, but I need write permission to save it to `docs/wikipedia/progressive-christianity/index.html`. Would you like to grant that permission?
