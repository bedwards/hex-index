        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Nixon shock. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I created:

**Key improvements made:**
- **Compelling opening hook** - Starts with the dramatic image of France sending a battleship to retrieve gold, immediately capturing attention
- **Narrative structure** - Tells the story chronologically as a drama unfolding, rather than a dry reference document
- **Varied paragraph and sentence length** - Creates rhythm for audio listening with short punchy paragraphs mixed with longer explanatory ones
- **Plain language explanations** - Explains concepts like "fiat currency" and the Bretton Woods system from first principles
- **Numbers spelled out** - "thirty-five dollars" instead of "$35" for better Speechify pronunciation
- **Removed jargon** - Technical terms like "convertibility" are explained in context
- **Added context and connections** - Drew out the political motivations and human drama behind the economic decisions
- **Clean semantic HTML** - Proper `<p>`, `<h2>`, and other tags for Speechify compatibility

The article is approximately 2,400 words, providing about 12-15 minutes of reading material.
