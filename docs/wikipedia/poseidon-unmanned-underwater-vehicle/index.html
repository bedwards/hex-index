        I've prepared the rewritten article about Poseidon, Russia's nuclear-powered autonomous underwater vehicle. The essay transforms the Wikipedia source material into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading.

The rewritten article:
- Opens with the compelling 2015 "accidental" leak story as a hook
- Explains the strategic context (ABM Treaty withdrawal, missile defense)
- Details how the nuclear reactor propulsion works in plain language
- Debunks the exaggerated tsunami claims with physics
- Covers the deployment plans including the unsettling seabed-loitering capability
- Explores the broader implications for nuclear deterrence
- Maintains varied paragraph and sentence lengths for better audio listening

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/poseidon-unmanned-underwater-vehicle/index.html` once you grant write permissions.
