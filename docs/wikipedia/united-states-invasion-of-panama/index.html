<p>On December 20, 1989, at forty-six minutes past midnight, the largest American military operation since Vietnam crashed into Panama. Within hours, the dictator Manuel Noriega—a man who had been on the Central Intelligence Agency payroll for over two decades—became a fugitive in his own country, eventually cornered in the Vatican embassy while American psychological operations blasted rock music at the walls.</p>

<p>It was an absurd end to an absurd relationship.</p>

<h2>The Man Who Knew Too Much</h2>

<p>Manuel Noriega's story is really a story about the price of useful monsters. From 1967 onward, Noriega served as a paid informant for the CIA, including during the years when George H.W. Bush ran the agency. He was exactly the kind of asset intelligence services dream about: well-positioned, ruthless, and willing to do the dirty work that democracies prefer to outsource.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, Noriega proved his worth repeatedly. He sabotaged the Sandinista government in Nicaragua—the leftist revolutionaries who had overthrown the American-backed Somoza dictatorship. He undermined the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front in El Salvador, another leftist insurgency that Washington feared. For this, he received between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand dollars annually from the CIA, depending on the year and the intensity of American needs in Central America.</p>

<p>But Noriega was running a parallel operation. While working with the Drug Enforcement Administration to make selective busts that burnished his reputation as an anti-drug ally, he was simultaneously accepting enormous payments from drug cartels. He facilitated money laundering. He provided protection from the very DEA investigations he was supposedly supporting. The cocaine that flooded American cities in the 1980s often passed through Panamanian networks that Noriega sheltered.</p>

<p>This was fine, apparently, as long as he remained useful on the geopolitical chessboard.</p>

<h2>The Canal and Its Shadow</h2>

<p>To understand why Panama mattered so much, you need to understand a waterway. The Panama Canal—that fifty-mile engineering marvel carved through the isthmus in the early twentieth century—remained one of the most strategically important passages on Earth. Ships traveling from New York to San Francisco could save nearly eight thousand miles by cutting through Panama instead of sailing around South America.</p>

<p>The United States had controlled the Canal Zone since 1903, maintaining military bases and a substantial garrison to protect American interests. But in 1977, President Jimmy Carter and Panama's military strongman Omar Torrijos signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which set in motion a gradual transfer of the canal to Panamanian control by the year 2000. The deal included a crucial provision: the canal would remain open to American shipping regardless of who operated it.</p>

<p>Noriega inherited this arrangement when he consolidated power in the early 1980s after Torrijos died in a plane crash. He became Panama's de facto dictator—never holding the title of president, but wielding absolute authority through his control of the Panama Defense Forces.</p>

<h2>The Relationship Sours</h2>

<p>By the mid-1980s, the convenient fiction of Noriega as American ally was becoming impossible to maintain. In 1986, the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an exposé in The New York Times laying out Noriega's drug trafficking connections and his work for the CIA. The story forced President Ronald Reagan to open negotiations with Noriega, essentially asking him to resign and go away quietly.</p>

<p>Noriega refused. He calculated, correctly, that the extradition laws between Panama and the United States were too weak to pose a real threat. American courts indicted him on drug charges in 1988, but indictments are just pieces of paper if you control your own country's military and police.</p>

<p>Some officials in the Pentagon—particularly Elliott Abrams, the combative Assistant Secretary of State—began pushing for an invasion. Reagan refused. The problem was George H.W. Bush. The vice president was running for president in 1988, and his history with Noriega through the CIA created obvious vulnerabilities. An invasion that put Noriega on trial might put Bush's past on trial too.</p>

<p>So the administration tried different tactics. They offered to drop the drug indictments if Noriega would just leave. They supported coup attempts against him. They tightened economic sanctions. Nothing worked.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Noriega began hedging his bets. If the Americans were turning against him, perhaps other patrons might prove more reliable. He started accepting military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya—a portfolio of regimes guaranteed to alarm Washington.</p>

<h2>The Stolen Election</h2>

<p>In May 1989, Panama held national elections. Noriega's regime expected to manage the results, as authoritarian regimes typically do. But the opposition had learned from stolen elections elsewhere. They stationed observers at every polling station and counted the ballots before they could be sent to district centers for "processing."</p>

<p>Their tally showed the opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, defeating Noriega's candidate by a margin of nearly three to one.</p>

<p>It was a devastating repudiation.</p>

<p>Noriega's response was blunt. He annulled the election. When Endara appeared in a motorcade the next day, Noriega's supporters physically attacked him. The message was clear: democracy in Panama meant whatever Noriega said it meant.</p>

<p>President Bush—now elected himself—responded by reinforcing the American garrison in the Canal Zone and increasing military exercises designed to pressure Noriega. American forces began conducting "Category Three" exercises on security-sensitive targets. They ignored Panamanian roadblocks. The explicit goal, according to military planners, was to provoke Noriega's soldiers into doing something that could justify stronger action.</p>

<h2>The Spark</h2>

<p>On December 15, 1989, the Panamanian general assembly passed a resolution declaring that a state of war existed between Panama and the United States. The declaration was largely rhetorical—Panama's military was no match for American forces—but it would prove convenient as a legal justification for what came next.</p>

<p>The following night, four American military officers left their base at Fort Clayton to have dinner at a Marriott hotel in downtown Panama City. They were stopped at a roadblock outside the headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces.</p>

<p>What happened next depends on who you believe. The Pentagon said the officers were unarmed, in a private vehicle, and tried to flee only after an angry crowd surrounded them. The Panamanians claimed the Americans were armed and conducting reconnaissance. Either way, the Panama Defense Forces opened fire. A round entered the rear of the vehicle and struck Marine First Lieutenant Robert Paz in the back.</p>

<p>Paz was rushed to Gorgas Army Hospital but died of his wounds.</p>

<p>A Navy SEAL lieutenant and his wife witnessed the incident. They were detained by Panamanian troops. The lieutenant was beaten severely enough to require two weeks of hospitalization. His wife was threatened with sexual assault.</p>

<p>On December 16, President Bush ordered the execution of the invasion plan. H-Hour was set for one o'clock in the morning on December 20.</p>

<h2>Operation Just Cause</h2>

<p>The name mattered. Military operations receive code names that are randomly generated, but politically sensitive operations get names chosen for their propaganda value. "Just Cause" was meant to frame the invasion as righteous before the first soldier landed.</p>

<p>Bush articulated four official justifications when he announced the invasion a few hours after it began. First, protecting American citizens—roughly thirty-five thousand lived in Panama, and Noriega had declared a state of war against their country. Second, defending democracy and human rights, given Noriega's nullification of the election. Third, combating drug trafficking, since Panama had become a major transit point and money-laundering center. Fourth, protecting the Panama Canal treaties, which the United States claimed Noriega threatened to violate.</p>

<p>These justifications proved sufficient to secure bipartisan Congressional support. But the operation's secrecy, speed, and overwhelming success meant that debate was essentially moot. You cannot vote against a war that's already won.</p>

<p>American public opinion supported the invasion by a margin of eighty percent approval. One academic study later suggested that Bush's decision was driven primarily by domestic political calculations. Having been mocked as a wimp during the 1988 campaign, he needed to demonstrate toughness. Panama offered a nearly risk-free opportunity.</p>

<h2>The Invasion</h2>

<p>The operation involved nearly twenty-eight thousand American troops and over three hundred aircraft. It was a showcase for new military technology. The AH-64 Apache attack helicopter saw its first combat deployment. So did the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle—the Humvee that would become ubiquitous in later wars. Most dramatically, the F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter made its combat debut, dropping precision munitions while remaining invisible to Panamanian radar.</p>

<p>Panamanian forces were overwhelmed almost immediately. The Panama Defense Forces numbered only about sixteen thousand, poorly equipped and poorly trained compared to American special operations units and airborne infantry. Within hours, most organized resistance had collapsed.</p>

<p>Guillermo Endara—the man who had actually won the May election—was sworn in as president shortly after the invasion began. He took the oath at an American military base, which said something about the nature of his mandate.</p>

<h2>The Hunt for Noriega</h2>

<p>Noriega himself proved harder to catch. For several days, he evaded American forces, reportedly moving between safe houses while his regime crumbled around him. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he sought refuge in the most unlikely place imaginable: the diplomatic mission of the Holy See—the Vatican's embassy in Panama City.</p>

<p>This created an awkward situation. Diplomatic missions enjoy protection under international law. The Americans could not simply storm the building without creating a massive diplomatic incident with the Catholic Church. So they tried other approaches.</p>

<p>Military psychological operations units set up loudspeakers outside the embassy and began blasting rock music at maximum volume. The playlist reportedly included songs like "I Fought the Law" and "Welcome to the Jungle." The goal was either to pressure Noriega into surrendering or to pressure the Vatican into expelling him. The tactic was mocked internationally as adolescent—which it was—but it worked. On January 3, 1990, Noriega surrendered.</p>

<p>He was immediately flown to the United States, where he stood trial on the drug trafficking and racketeering charges that had been filed two years earlier. He was convicted and sentenced to forty years in prison.</p>

<h2>The Costs</h2>

<p>The Pentagon estimated that 516 Panamanians died during the invasion: 314 soldiers and 202 civilians. Independent researchers have argued the civilian toll was significantly higher, perhaps several thousand, though precise numbers remain disputed. The El Chorrillo neighborhood near the Panama Defense Forces headquarters was devastated, with thousands of residents displaced.</p>

<p>Twenty-three American soldiers died, along with three American civilians.</p>

<p>The United Nations General Assembly condemned the invasion as a violation of international law. So did the Organization of American States. So did the European Parliament. The votes were overwhelming. The United States, as usual when it faced such condemnation, simply ignored the criticism and proceeded with its plans.</p>

<h2>What It Meant</h2>

<p>Some scholars have argued that the Panama invasion was the first major American military operation not driven by Cold War logic. The Soviet Union was collapsing. The old framework of communist versus capitalist struggle was becoming obsolete. Panama represented something new: intervention for regime change, justified by a combination of human rights, drug enforcement, and the protection of American citizens abroad.</p>

<p>It was a template that would be used again. The emphasis on international legitimacy (even when that legitimacy was contested), the focus on public opinion, the rapid decisive operations, the installation of a friendly government—all of these elements would reappear in later interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Panama invasion also demonstrated something about the relationship between intelligence agencies and the dictators they cultivate. Noriega knew American secrets. He had worked with American spies for over twenty years. In the end, that made him not more valuable but more dangerous. He knew too much to be allowed to remain in power once he became inconvenient.</p>

<p>The Panama Defense Forces were dissolved after the invasion. Panama became the rare Latin American country with no standing army—a legacy that persists to this day. Whether this represented a victory for demilitarization or simply the replacement of a Panamanian security apparatus with dependence on American power is a question that Panamanians continue to debate.</p>

<h2>The Long Shadow</h2>

<p>Noriega served his American prison sentence. He was then extradited to France, where he faced additional money laundering charges. After serving time there, he was finally returned to Panama in 2011 to serve sentences for human rights violations committed during his dictatorship. He died in 2017, still in Panamanian custody.</p>

<p>The canal, meanwhile, passed to Panamanian control on schedule in 1999. The fears that had partly justified American intervention—that the canal's neutrality would be compromised, that it would fall into hostile hands—never materialized. Panama has operated the canal successfully, expanding it in 2016 to accommodate larger modern cargo ships.</p>

<p>The invasion took fewer than two weeks of major combat operations. It achieved its immediate objectives. It was popular at home and quickly forgotten by most Americans. But it established patterns of intervention that would prove far more costly when applied to larger countries with more complex societies. Panama was easy. Nothing that came after would be.</p>

<p>The lesson that American planners took from Operation Just Cause was that regime change could be quick, clean, and decisive. The lesson they should have taken was that Panama's small size, its lack of ethnic divisions, its history of American involvement, and the genuine unpopularity of Noriega created conditions that would not be replicated elsewhere. But that lesson would only become clear much later, in the mountains of Afghanistan and the cities of Iraq, where operations planned with Panamanian confidence produced very different results.</p>
