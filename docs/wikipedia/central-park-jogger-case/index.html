<p>Five teenagers spent between seven and thirteen years in prison for a crime they did not commit. They confessed on videotape. They were convicted by juries. And they were completely innocent.</p>

<p>The Central Park jogger case is one of the most consequential miscarriages of justice in American history—not because it was unique, but because it laid bare the machinery of wrongful conviction in a way that could not be ignored. It exposed how confessions can be manufactured, how media narratives can harden into accepted truth, and how the presumption of innocence can evaporate when fear and prejudice fill the air.</p>

<h2>The Night of April 19, 1989</h2>

<p>New York City in 1989 was a different place than the sanitized tourist destination it would later become. The crack cocaine epidemic was at its peak. The city recorded over two thousand homicides that year—roughly six murders every single day. Central Park, that improbable rectangle of green in the heart of Manhattan, had become a symbol of urban decay, a place many New Yorkers avoided after dark.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 19, somewhere between twenty and thirty teenagers from East Harlem entered the park's northern section. What happened next would become the subject of intense dispute, multiple trials, and decades of recrimination.</p>

<p>Some of the teenagers committed crimes that night. That much is certain. Between nine and ten o'clock, assailants attacked cyclists, threw rocks at a taxi, and robbed a pedestrian of his food and beer, leaving him unconscious. A competitive bike rider named Michael Vigna testified that someone tried to punch him around 9:05 in the evening. Gerald Malone and Patricia Dean, riding a tandem bicycle, said a group of boys tried to block their path; they sped toward them and scattered them.</p>

<p>The violence escalated. Four male joggers were attacked near the reservoir between 9:25 and 9:50 in the evening. One of them, John Loughlin, was knocked down, kicked, punched, and beaten with a pipe and stick. A police officer who found him later said he was bleeding so badly that he "looked like he was dunked in a bucket of blood."</p>

<p>But the attack that would seize the city's attention—and the nation's—happened to a twenty-eight-year-old investment banker named Trisha Meili.</p>

<h2>The Victim</h2>

<p>Meili had gone for her regular evening jog in Central Park sometime before nine o'clock. She was a Yale graduate, a Phi Beta Kappa who had earned two master's degrees. She worked at Salomon Brothers, the investment bank. She was, in the language of the era, a success story—the kind of young professional whose presence in New York's financial district represented the city's ambitions for itself.</p>

<p>She was found at 1:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>A police officer discovered her naked, gagged, and tied in a shallow ravine about three hundred feet north of the 102nd Street crossing. She had been dragged nearly three hundred feet off the roadway before being brutally attacked. The officer who found her said she had been "beaten as badly as anybody I've ever seen beaten. She looked like she was tortured."</p>

<p>The medical details were horrifying. She had lost between seventy-five and eighty percent of her blood. Her skull was fractured so severely that her left eye had been dislodged from its socket, which itself was fractured in twenty-one places. She had severe hypothermia. She had severe brain damage. She was in a coma for twelve days.</p>

<p>That she survived at all was remarkable. That she would eventually return to work, write a memoir, and become an advocate for survivors of violence was extraordinary. But on the morning of April 20, 1989, none of that seemed possible. What seemed certain was that a monster—or monsters—had done this, and the city wanted blood.</p>

<h2>The Arrests</h2>

<p>Police took Raymond Santana and Kevin Richardson into custody around 10:15 that night, before Meili was even found. Both were fourteen years old. Steven Lopez, fifteen, was arrested within an hour. The next day, police brought in Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam, also fifteen, after other teenagers identified them as having been in the park.</p>

<p>Then there was Korey Wise.</p>

<p>Wise, sixteen, was not a suspect. He simply accompanied his friend Yusef Salaam to the police station for questioning. He walked in voluntarily. The police questioned him anyway.</p>

<p>What happened over the next several hours would determine the course of these young men's lives. And almost none of it was recorded.</p>

<h2>The Confessions</h2>

<p>Here is what we know: the videotaped confessions began on April 21, after detectives had conducted unrecorded interrogations lasting at least seven hours. Seven hours of questioning that no one outside that room would ever see or hear.</p>

<p>Four of the teenagers—Santana, McCray, Richardson, and Wise—made videotaped statements. Santana, McCray, and Richardson had parents present during the videotaping, though those parents had generally not been present during the preceding hours of interrogation. Wise made his statements entirely alone, without any parent, guardian, or attorney.</p>

<p>Yusef Salaam's situation was different. When police took him into custody, he told them he was sixteen and showed identification to prove it. Under New York law at the time, once a suspect turned sixteen, their parents no longer had the right to be present during questioning. But Salaam was actually fifteen. When his mother arrived and demanded a lawyer, police stopped the questioning. He never made a videotaped confession and never signed his earlier written statement—though the court later allowed that statement to be used against him anyway.</p>

<p>The confessions were damning. Each teenager admitted to being at the scene. Each described participating in the attack in some way—holding the victim down, touching her, being present while others raped her. Each named others as the actual rapists.</p>

<p>And the confessions were a mess.</p>

<p>They contradicted each other on basic facts: when the attack happened, where it happened, how it happened. They named participants who were never questioned or charged. Only Korey Wise made any statement placing the attack at specific times and locations—and detectives had taken Wise to the crime scene before recording his confession.</p>

<p>None of the five said he had actually raped Meili. Each described himself as a peripheral participant, a reluctant accomplice.</p>

<p>Two weeks after making these statements, every single one of them recanted.</p>

<h2>Why Would Innocent People Confess?</h2>

<p>This is the question that haunts wrongful conviction cases, and it haunted this one. If these teenagers were innocent, why did they confess? How could anyone admit to something they didn't do?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the psychology of coerced confession, which researchers have studied extensively in the decades since this case. Teenagers are particularly vulnerable. Their brains are not fully developed; they are more susceptible to suggestion, more likely to believe that compliance will lead to release, less capable of understanding long-term consequences. Add exhaustion, fear, and sophisticated interrogation techniques, and false confessions become not just possible but predictable.</p>

<p>Yusef Salaam later described what those hours were like: "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room," he said. "They would come and look at me and say: 'You realize you're next.' The fear made me feel really like I was not going to be able to make it out."</p>

<p>Detective Tom McKenna falsely told Salaam that his fingerprints had been found on the victim's clothing. This was not true. But Salaam was fifteen years old, alone, and terrified.</p>

<p>The tactic McKenna used has a name: it's called the "false evidence ploy," and it's legal in American interrogation rooms. Police are permitted to lie to suspects about evidence. They can claim to have fingerprints they don't have, DNA they don't have, eyewitnesses who don't exist. The Supreme Court has never ruled this unconstitutional, though other democracies have banned the practice.</p>

<h2>The Media Firestorm</h2>

<p>The case exploded into public consciousness in a way few crimes ever do. The New York Times would later call the attack "one of the most widely publicized crimes of the 1980s."</p>

<p>Part of this was timing. New York was drowning in violent crime, and residents were desperate for someone to blame. Part of it was the victim—a young, successful, white professional woman attacked while jogging in the city's most iconic park. And part of it was the alleged perpetrators—Black and Latino teenagers from Harlem.</p>

<p>The racial dynamics were impossible to ignore, though many tried.</p>

<p>Normal police procedures required withholding the names of suspects under sixteen. Those procedures were ignored. The teenagers' names, photographs, and addresses were released to the press before any of them had been formally arraigned. Their families received death threats. Other residents of the Schomburg Plaza, the housing complex where four of the suspects lived, were threatened as well.</p>

<p>Reverend Calvin Butts of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, who supported the five suspects, put it bluntly: "The first thing you do in the United States of America when a white woman is raped is round up a bunch of Black youths, and I think that's what happened here."</p>

<p>The term "wilding" entered the American lexicon. Senior police investigators held a press conference on April 21 and said the suspects had used this word to describe their actions. The term spread through newspapers and television broadcasts, becoming shorthand for the supposed savagery of urban youth.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: investigative reporter Barry Michael Cooper soon reported that "wilding" originated from a police detective's misunderstanding. The teenagers had actually been talking about "doing the wild thing"—lyrics from rapper Tone Loc's hit song "Wild Thing." A misheard pop culture reference became a descriptor for an entire generation of young Black men.</p>

<h2>Donald Trump Buys Full-Page Ads</h2>

<p>Ten days after the arrests, real estate developer Donald Trump spent an estimated eighty-five thousand dollars—equivalent to about two hundred sixteen thousand dollars today—on full-page advertisements in all four of New York's major newspapers.</p>

<p>The ads called for the return of the death penalty.</p>

<p>"I want to hate these muggers and murderers," Trump wrote. "They should be forced to suffer." He demanded that "criminals of every age" be made to fear punishment. "Criminals must be told that their Civil Liberties End When an Attack On Our Safety Begins!"</p>

<p>The ads did not name the five teenagers specifically. They referred instead to "roving bands of wild criminals." But the timing and context made the target clear.</p>

<p>New York did not have the death penalty. Rape, even the most brutal rape, was not a capital offense. The five suspects were minors. None of this mattered to the narrative taking shape. These boys—because that's what they were, boys—had become symbols of everything that was wrong with the city, everything that frightened its citizens, everything that demanded punishment.</p>

<h2>The Evidence That Wasn't There</h2>

<p>Here is what the physical evidence actually showed: nothing.</p>

<p>DNA analysis of samples collected from the crime scene—from Meili's cervix and from her running sock—matched none of the suspects. The results were reported as "inconclusive," a word that would later prove to be doing a lot of work. What "inconclusive" meant, in practice, was that there was no physical evidence connecting any of the five to the sexual assault.</p>

<p>No blood. No semen. No hair. No fibers. No skin cells. Nothing.</p>

<p>Meili had been attacked with extraordinary violence. Her skull was fractured in twenty-one places. She had lost nearly eighty percent of her blood. An assault of that brutality, committed by multiple people, should have left a forensic trail. It didn't.</p>

<p>The prosecution had confessions. That was enough.</p>

<h2>The Trials</h2>

<p>The five teenagers were tried in two separate proceedings in 1990. Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana were tried together; Kevin Richardson and Korey Wise were tried separately.</p>

<p>All five were convicted.</p>

<p>They were convicted despite the lack of physical evidence. They were convicted despite the contradictions in their confessions. They were convicted despite their retractions. The videotapes were enough. Jurors saw teenagers admitting to a horrific crime, and they believed what they saw.</p>

<p>The sentences ranged from five to fifteen years. McCray, Richardson, Salaam, and Santana, who were tried as juveniles, received sentences of five to ten years. Korey Wise, who was sixteen and tried as an adult, received five to fifteen years. Because he was the oldest, he served his time in adult facilities—a distinction that would prove devastating.</p>

<p>Wise ultimately served nearly thirteen years, longer than any of the others. He was transferred between multiple maximum-security prisons. He was placed in solitary confinement for extended periods. He was beaten by other inmates. He was twenty-eight years old when he was finally released.</p>

<h2>The Real Rapist</h2>

<p>In 2001, Matias Reyes was serving a life sentence for a series of rapes and a murder committed in 1989—the same year as the Central Park attack. He was incarcerated at the Auburn Correctional Facility in upstate New York when he ran into Korey Wise.</p>

<p>Reyes recognized Wise from prison. He felt what he later described as remorse. He approached a prison official and confessed.</p>

<p>He said he had attacked Trisha Meili. He said he had acted alone.</p>

<p>DNA testing confirmed his involvement. Semen from the crime scene matched Reyes's genetic profile. The match was conclusive.</p>

<p>Reyes was a serial rapist. In the summer of 1989, the same summer as the Central Park attack, he had assaulted at least four other women in Upper Manhattan. One of his victims was a pregnant woman whom he raped and murdered, stabbing her multiple times and gouging out her eyes. He had been active in the exact area where Meili was attacked, during the exact time period, using the exact methods.</p>

<p>The police had never connected him to the case. They had their confessions. They had their convictions. They had stopped looking.</p>

<h2>The Exoneration</h2>

<p>In December 2002, New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau asked a judge to vacate the convictions of all five defendants. Justice Charles Tejada granted the motion.</p>

<p>The teenagers who had become known as the Central Park Five were now, more than a decade later, free men. They had lost their youth. They had lost their educations, their opportunities, their relationships, their futures. Korey Wise had spent nearly thirteen years in maximum-security prisons for a crime he did not commit.</p>

<p>Steven Lopez, whose charges had been reduced and whose case had taken a different path, had his convictions vacated separately in July 2022.</p>

<h2>The Aftermath</h2>

<p>The five men—Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise—sued New York City for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination, and emotional distress. The city fought the lawsuit for years, through multiple administrations, spending millions of dollars on legal fees rather than settlement.</p>

<p>In 2014, the city finally settled. The amount was forty-one million dollars—roughly one million for each year the five had collectively spent in prison.</p>

<p>The settlement came with no admission of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>No police officer was disciplined. No prosecutor faced consequences. The detectives who conducted the interrogations continued their careers. The system that had manufactured five false confessions remained intact.</p>

<h2>What We Learned—And What We Didn't</h2>

<p>The Central Park jogger case became a reference point for discussions of criminal justice reform, wrongful conviction, and racial bias in policing. Documentaries were made. Books were written. The five men became advocates and speakers. Yusef Salaam was elected to the New York City Council in 2023.</p>

<p>The case demonstrated, with painful clarity, how innocent people can be convinced to confess to crimes they didn't commit. It showed how media narratives can harden into accepted truth before any evidence is tested in court. It revealed how racial fear can override due process, how the presumption of innocence can evaporate when a crime is sufficiently horrific and the suspects sufficiently despised.</p>

<p>But it also demonstrated how little has changed. Police are still permitted to lie to suspects during interrogations. Teenagers are still interrogated without meaningful protections. False confessions still occur with disturbing regularity. According to the Innocence Project, approximately thirty percent of wrongful convictions overturned by DNA evidence involved false confessions.</p>

<p>The Central Park Five became the Exonerated Five. They got their settlement. They got their freedom. They got vindication, of a sort.</p>

<p>But the system that destroyed their youth remains largely unchanged. The next five teenagers are out there somewhere, waiting to encounter it.</p>

<h2>A Note on Trisha Meili</h2>

<p>Trisha Meili suffered injuries that should have killed her. She survived them. She endured years of rehabilitation. She returned to work at Salomon Brothers. She eventually wrote a memoir, "I Am the Central Park Jogger," published in 2003.</p>

<p>She has said that she does not remember the attack and cannot identify her assailant. She has expressed sympathy for the five men who were wrongfully convicted. She has also noted that her case, for all its notoriety, is not unique—that thousands of women are sexually assaulted every year, most of whom never receive the attention or resources devoted to her recovery.</p>

<p>Her survival was remarkable. Her grace in the aftermath has been equally so. She did not choose to become a symbol, but she has used that unwanted prominence to advocate for other survivors.</p>

<p>The man who actually attacked her, Matias Reyes, is serving a life sentence. He will likely die in prison. Justice, in his case, was eventually done—though not by the system that convicted five innocent teenagers in his place.</p>
