        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on blood quantum laws. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I created:

**Structure:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about the mathematics of identity rather than a dry definition
- 11 sections covering colonial origins, the Dawes Rolls, the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, the mathematical extinction problem, modern tribal variations, DNA testing limitations, Freedmen controversies, sovereignty tensions, and future alternatives
- Approximately 2,500 words (~12 minutes reading time)

**Key improvements for Speechify compatibility:**
- Varied sentence and paragraph lengths for natural rhythm
- Spelled out numbers (twenty-five percent, not 25%)
- Explained technical terms (single nucleotide polymorphisms, Wheeler-Howard Act)
- Used narrative transitions rather than encyclopedic listing
- Added context and connections (Three-Fifths Compromise parallel, Haudenosaunee adoption practices)

The article is ready to be saved once write permissions are granted for the new directory.
