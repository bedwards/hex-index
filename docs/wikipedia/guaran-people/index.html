<h2>The Warriors Who Named a Nation</h2>

<p>In Paraguay today, nearly everyone speaks Guaraní. Not just Indigenous communities tucked away in remote forests—everyone. The government official drafting legislation, the schoolteacher in Asunción, the farmer selling produce at a roadside stand. This makes Paraguay unique among the colonized nations of the Americas, perhaps the only country where the language of the conquered became the language of the nation.</p>

<p>How did this happen? How did one Indigenous people manage to plant their tongue so deeply in South American soil that five centuries of European colonization couldn't uproot it?</p>

<p>The answer lies in a remarkable confluence of geography, warfare, missionary zeal, and the resilience of a people who called themselves, simply, Abá—"the people."</p>

<h2>Before the Europeans Arrived</h2>

<p>When Spanish ships first appeared on the horizon of the Río de la Plata in the early sixteenth century, approximately 400,000 Guaraní people lived in the lush territories between the Paraná and Paraguay rivers. Their homeland stretched across what we now call Paraguay, northeastern Argentina, southern Brazil, and parts of Uruguay and Bolivia.</p>

<p>They weren't nomads. The Guaraní had built a sophisticated agricultural civilization centered on manioc (that starchy root vegetable also known as cassava), maize, wild game, and honey. Their villages consisted of large communal houses called malocas, each sheltering multiple families under the authority of a chief. Communities organized themselves into loose tribal confederations based on dialect—they shared a language, but spoke it with regional variations that marked them as belonging to particular groups.</p>

<p>The Guaraní practiced polygamy, and they practiced something far more disturbing to European sensibilities: cannibalism, at least of war captives. This wasn't casual violence. It was ritualized, perhaps connected to funeral practices or the symbolic absorption of an enemy's power. The Jesuit missionary Martin Dobrizhoffer, writing later, noted that the practice had evolved—by his time, the Guaraní disposed of their dead in large ceramic jars placed upside-down on the ground.</p>

<p>Their religious world was richly populated. At its center stood Ñamandu, "the true father, the first one," a creator deity from whom all things flowed. Below him in the celestial hierarchy came Tupã (also called Yporú), a thunder god who would later be appropriated by Christian missionaries as a name for the Christian God. Jasy ruled the night—a benevolent lunar presence. And lurking at the bottom of the thundering Iguazu Falls dwelt Aña, a malevolent spirit of chaos.</p>

<h2>A World Where Everything Had a Soul</h2>

<p>The Guaraní believed in a universe saturated with consciousness. Animals, plants, even minerals possessed spirits that could transform, that could once have been human or might become human. A hummingbird—called Mainumby—carried good spirits from flowers back to Tupã. Glowworms were the reincarnated souls of certain people. Butterflies, too.</p>

<p>Some transformations told tragic stories. Ka'a Jarýi was a woman who became yerba mate, the bitter herb that would later become South America's most beloved caffeinated drink. Irupé was a maiden who fell in love with the moon and was turned into the giant water lily that floats on Amazonian rivers, her heart forever reaching toward the sky.</p>

<p>Then there were the Pombero.</p>

<p>These weren't transformed humans. They were something else entirely—goblin-like spirits from another realm who inhabited the forests and demanded appeasement. The most famous was Jasy Jatere, a being described inconsistently in the legends. Some stories paint him as a handsome blond dwarf with a thick beard who lived naked inside tree trunks. Others describe an ugly, lame old man with backwards feet. What the stories agree on is his predilection for snatching children, licking them, and either wrapping them in vines or drowning them in rivers. To keep him at bay, people left offerings of honey in the parts of the forest associated with his presence.</p>

<p>Another Pombero, Kurupi, was more explicitly sexual—a figure with scaly lizard skin, hypnotic eyes, and an enormous phallus, who would copulate with young women. These weren't fairy tales for children. They were explanatory myths, frameworks for understanding danger, fertility, the mysterious forces that seemed to animate the wild.</p>

<p>The Iguazu Falls held special power in this cosmology. The Guaraní believed that at certain times, you could hear the sounds of ancient battles echoing from the cascading water. It was here that a malevolent Pombero spirit called I-Yara abducted a beautiful maiden named Angá and hid her away. The swallows that nest in the falls to this day, swooping through the mist, are said to be eternally searching for her.</p>

<h2>Contact and Catastrophe</h2>

<p>The Spanish arrived in 1516, led by Juan Díaz de Solís. The meeting went badly. Native forces defeated the expedition, killing Solís himself. But a surviving group under Alejo García pressed inland, accompanied by Guaraní guides—an early sign of the complex relationships that would develop between these peoples.</p>

<p>Twenty years later, Gonzalo de Mendoza passed through Paraguay and founded Asunción, which would become the capital of the new Spanish territory. The first governor made a fateful decision: rather than maintaining strict separation between colonizers and colonized, he encouraged intermarriage between Spanish men and Indigenous women. The children of these unions—mestizos—would come to define the Paraguayan nation.</p>

<p>This wasn't gentle assimilation. Spanish colonization brought violence, displacement, and the constant threat of enslavement. In 1542, a Guaraní chief named Aracare, from the Jejuy River region, refused to serve a Spanish expedition. The governor ordered his arrest. Aracare was hanged. Two other chiefs, Tabaré and Guacani, led an uprising in response. It failed.</p>

<p>But the worst was yet to come, and it wouldn't come from the Spanish.</p>

<h2>The Slavers of São Paulo</h2>

<p>The town of São Paulo, on the Brazilian coast, had begun as a meeting place for Portuguese and Dutch pirates. It evolved into something darker: a center of the slave trade, populated by criminals and adventurers who mixed with Indigenous and African women and made their living capturing and selling human beings.</p>

<p>The Guaraní, with their settled agricultural communities and their relatively dense population, were perfect targets. The slave hunters from São Paulo—called Paulistas or Mamelucos—descended on Guaraní villages with firearms, organization, and ruthless efficiency. The Guaraní had only bows and arrows to oppose them.</p>

<p>Thousands were killed. Thousands more were marched in chains to São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to be sold.</p>

<h2>The Jesuit Experiment</h2>

<p>Into this nightmare stepped the Jesuits.</p>

<p>The Society of Jesus—founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola—was the Catholic Church's intellectual and missionary vanguard. The Jesuits were scholars, educators, and evangelists who believed that converting Indigenous peoples required understanding their languages and cultures, not simply destroying them.</p>

<p>The first Jesuits arrived in what is now southern Brazil in 1585. They established a college in Asunción and immediately began protesting the enslavement of Indigenous peoples. Their protests reached the Spanish crown, and in 1608, King Philip III granted the Jesuits authority to convert and colonize the Guaraní tribes—and implicitly, to protect them from slavers.</p>

<p>What emerged was one of the strangest social experiments in colonial history: the Jesuit Reductions.</p>

<p>The word "reduction" comes from the Latin <em>reducere</em>, meaning to lead back or bring together. The Jesuits gathered dispersed Guaraní communities into organized mission towns, each centered on a church and administered by Jesuit priests. Father Ruiz de Montoya documented the early challenges in his book <em>The Spiritual Conquest</em>. One Guaraní chief, Miguel Artiguaye, initially refused to join a mission—until a hostile Indigenous group threatened his people. Then he came to the Jesuits begging for protection.</p>

<p>This was the fundamental bargain. The missions offered the only real protection against enslavement. In exchange, the Guaraní converted to Christianity, submitted to mission discipline, and provided labor. The first mission, Loreto, was founded on the Paranapanema River in 1610. Within a few years, the Guaraní flocked to the missions in such numbers that twelve more were established, containing 40,000 people.</p>

<p>The Guaraní grew crops to feed the mission populations and produced goods for trade. The missions became economically self-sufficient, even prosperous. And crucially, the Jesuits learned Guaraní, preached in Guaraní, and translated Christian texts into Guaraní. They weren't trying to make the Guaraní into Spaniards. They were trying to make them into Christian Guaraní.</p>

<h2>War Against the Slavers</h2>

<p>The Paulista slavers saw the missions as convenient concentration camps—places where large numbers of Guaraní could be captured at once.</p>

<p>In 1629, a Paulista army surrounded the San Antonio mission on a Sunday, when the entire population was gathered for Mass. They set fire to the church and other buildings, killed everyone too young, too old, or too resistant to be valuable as slaves, and marched the rest away in chains. San Miguel and Jesus Maria fell the same way. Within two years, all but two of the missions had been destroyed. Sixty thousand Guaraní converts were carried off to be sold.</p>

<p>Father Antonio Ruiz de Montoya, the same Jesuit who had written about Chief Artiguaye, sailed to Europe on a desperate mission. He secured two crucial documents: a papal letter from Urban VIII forbidding the enslavement of mission Guaraní under the severest church penalties, and a royal decree from Philip IV of Spain permitting the Guaraní to carry firearms and be trained in their use by former soldiers who had joined the Jesuit order.</p>

<p>This changed everything.</p>

<p>When the next Paulista army—800 strong—attacked in 1641, they met armed Guaraní defenders on the Acaray River. The Christian Guaraní, fighting with European guns under Jesuit leadership, inflicted a devastating defeat. The slavers wouldn't return for ten years.</p>

<p>By 1732, the Guaraní missions were guarded by a well-drilled army of 7,000 Indigenous soldiers. On multiple occasions, this force defended not just the missions but the entire Spanish colonial frontier against Portuguese incursion. The Guaraní had become Spain's military allies—Christians who spoke their own language, lived in their own communities, and answered to Jesuit priests rather than Spanish colonial administrators.</p>

<h2>Paradise and Its Discontents</h2>

<p>At their peak, the thirty Guaraní missions contained over 141,000 people. Then came the catastrophes that no army could repel.</p>

<p>In 1734, smallpox swept through the missions, killing approximately 30,000. In 1765, a second outbreak killed 12,000 more before spreading westward through the tribes of the Chaco region. The missions survived, but diminished.</p>

<p>Then came the politics.</p>

<p>In 1750, the Treaty of Madrid redrew the border between Spanish and Portuguese territories in South America. Seven missions on the Uruguay River suddenly fell under Portuguese jurisdiction. The Guaraní were ordered to leave their homes and relocate to Spanish territory.</p>

<p>They refused. The Guaraní knew the Portuguese as slave hunters. They had no intention of submitting to Portuguese authority.</p>

<p>What followed was seven years of guerrilla warfare—the Guaraní War—in which thousands of mission Indians fought against both Portuguese and Spanish troops. Eventually, the Jesuits secured a royal decree restoring the disputed territory to Spanish control. But the damage was done. The myth of the peaceful, obedient mission Indian had been shattered. Colonial authorities had learned that the Guaraní, when pushed too far, would fight.</p>

<h2>The Expulsion</h2>

<p>In 1767, King Charles III of Spain expelled the Jesuits from all Spanish territories. The reasons were complex—political intrigue, fear of Jesuit power, Enlightenment anti-clericalism—but the effect on the Guaraní missions was devastating.</p>

<p>The viceroy, Antonio María Bucareli y Ursúa, approached the execution of the expulsion order with trepidation. The missions still had an army of 14,000 trained soldiers. But the Jesuits, true to their vows of obedience, submitted without resistance.</p>

<p>The Guaraní chiefs tried to stop it. From Mission San Luis, they wrote a letter to the Governor of Buenos Aires in February 1768, pleading for the Jesuits to stay: "The fathers of the Company of Jesus know how to get along with us, and we with them. We are happy serving God and the King."</p>

<p>The request was denied.</p>

<p>The missions were turned over to priests from other religious orders, but the magic was gone. Without the Jesuits' combination of spiritual authority, administrative skill, and genuine commitment to Guaraní welfare, the mission system slowly disintegrated. The Guaraní scattered. The great experiment was over.</p>

<h2>What Survived</h2>

<p>Here is the remarkable thing: the Guaraní themselves survived. Not as a museum exhibit or a remnant population in a remote corner of the forest, but as the cultural foundation of an entire nation.</p>

<p>Paraguay today is officially bilingual. Guaraní shares equal status with Spanish. As of 2012, an estimated ninety percent of Paraguay's population speaks the language—making it one of the most widely spoken Indigenous languages in the Americas. Children learn it at home and study it in school. It appears on street signs, in newspapers, on television.</p>

<p>The word "Guaraní" itself has shifted meaning. Originally, it may have been a Spanish imposition—the Jesuits used it for converted Indians, while calling those who rejected Christianity "Cayua" (roughly, "people of the jungle"). But today, in Paraguay, calling someone Guaraní is almost synonymous with calling them Paraguayan. It's how the French are sometimes called Gauls—an acknowledgment that the nation grew from Indigenous roots.</p>

<p>The old myths persist too. In rural Paraguay, people still speak of Jasy Jatere lurking in the forest, of the spirits in the Iguazu Falls, of the hummingbirds carrying souls back to Tupã. The animistic worldview that the Jesuits tried so hard to replace with Christianity survived alongside it, blending and merging until it became impossible to separate the strands.</p>

<p>Perhaps that was inevitable. The Jesuits, unlike most colonizers, had learned to speak Guaraní. They had translated their God into Guaraní words. And in doing so, they had made space for Guaraní concepts to survive inside the new faith.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of the Name</h2>

<p>There's a final irony in the word "Guaraní" itself. Barbara Ganson, a scholar of the region, notes that the name means "warrior" in the Tupi-Guaraní language family. In sixteenth-century Old Tupi, Jesuit sources recorded "Guarinĩ" as meaning "war, warrior, to wage war, warlord."</p>

<p>The people who called themselves simply "the people" were named by outsiders for their capacity for violence.</p>

<p>And they lived up to that name. They fought the slavers of São Paulo. They fought the Portuguese army. They fought anyone who threatened their families and their faith. When the Jesuits were taken from them, they wrote letters of protest. When letters failed, they scattered rather than submit.</p>

<p>Five hundred years later, their language is still spoken by millions. Their myths still animate the forests and waterfalls of their homeland. Their name defines a nation.</p>

<p>The warriors won.</p>
