        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Here's the HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Advisory_Committee_Act">Wikipedia: Federal Advisory Committee Act</a></p>

<p>In the early 1970s, the federal government had a problem it didn't like to talk about. Thousands of advisory committees were operating in the shadows, shaping policy on everything from environmental regulations to defense spending. Some had been meeting for decades without ever publishing a report. Others existed only on paper, created to give the appearance of expertise while predetermined conclusions sailed through. The public had no idea who was advising their government, what they were recommending, or whose interests they really served.</p>

<p>Congress decided to open the windows and let the light in.</p>

<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act, passed in 1972, represents one of the most ambitious attempts in American history to make government advice transparent. It's a law built on a simple premise: when outside experts help the government make decisions, the public has a right to know who they are and what they're saying.</p>

<h2>What Exactly Is a Federal Advisory Committee?</h2>

<p>The law casts a wide net. A federal advisory committee can be "any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group" that provides advice or recommendations to the President or federal agencies. If you've ever heard of a blue-ribbon commission, a task force on healthcare reform, or an expert panel reviewing scientific research, you've encountered the kind of body this law was designed to regulate.</p>

<p>These aren't bureaucracies. They're temporary, flexible entities—provisional bodies, in the language of the law—that can be assembled quickly to bring outside perspectives into government. They can recruit leading scientists, industry veterans, community advocates, and academic experts who would never take permanent government jobs. They offer a way to tap specialized knowledge without building permanent agencies.</p>

<p>But there's a catch embedded in that flexibility. Advisory committees can also be used to create an illusion of deliberation while rubber-stamping decisions that were already made. They can stack their membership with friendly voices. They can meet behind closed doors and produce reports that were written before the first meeting was called.</p>

<p>That's what Congress was trying to prevent.</p>

<h2>The Core Principles</h2>

<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act rests on four pillars: open meetings, formal chartering, public involvement, and rigorous reporting. Each addresses a specific way that advisory committees had been misused.</p>

<p>Open meetings are the most visible requirement. When an advisory committee gathers, those meetings must generally be open to the public. The committee must publish a notice in the Federal Register—the federal government's daily journal of official business—at least fifteen days before each meeting. That notice must include the committee's name, the time and place of the meeting, its purpose, and a summary of what will be discussed.</p>

<p>This sounds straightforward, but it represented a radical change. Before the law, many committees met in complete secrecy. Industry representatives could advise regulators on rules that would affect their competitors without anyone outside the room knowing what was said.</p>

<p>Chartering requirements force agencies to think carefully before creating new committees. Each advisory committee must have a formal charter that explains its purpose, its membership, and how long it will exist. Committees aren't meant to live forever—the law limits their terms and requires periodic renewal.</p>

<p>Public involvement goes beyond merely allowing people to attend meetings. Committees must make their materials available: reports, transcripts, minutes, working papers, and agendas. The goal is to ensure that the public can follow the committee's reasoning, not just observe its final recommendations.</p>

<p>Reporting requirements create a paper trail. The General Services Administration oversees compliance, and its Committee Management Secretariat monitors whether agencies are following the rules.</p>

<h2>The Locker Room Problem</h2>

<p>One of the more colorful concerns that drove the legislation was what lawmakers called "locker-room discussions." This wasn't about sports.</p>

<p>Agencies had learned that formal advisory committee meetings came with requirements they found burdensome. So they invented workarounds. Instead of convening the full committee, they would hold smaller gatherings under different names: subcommittees, working groups, task forces. These weren't full committee meetings, the argument went, so the transparency requirements didn't apply.</p>

<p>These informal sessions became where the real decisions happened. The official meetings turned into theater—carefully staged performances where predetermined conclusions were formally endorsed. The public could attend the show, but the script had been written elsewhere.</p>

<p>Congress tried to address this by declaring that all administrative procedures and hearings must be public knowledge. The intent was clear: you can't escape transparency requirements by changing what you call your meetings.</p>

<p>Whether this has fully worked is another question. The tension between the letter and spirit of transparency laws is a recurring theme in American government. Agencies that want to avoid public scrutiny often find creative interpretations, and the Federal Advisory Committee Act has been no exception.</p>

<h2>When Doors Can Close</h2>

<p>Not every meeting must be open. The law recognizes that some discussions legitimately require confidentiality—deliberations involving classified national security information, for instance, or personnel matters that would embarrass individuals if made public.</p>

<p>The Act borrows its exemptions from the Government in the Sunshine Act, passed four years later in 1976 as part of the same wave of post-Watergate transparency reforms. There are ten categories of information that can justify closing a meeting, ranging from national defense secrets to trade secrets to law enforcement records whose release would compromise investigations.</p>

<p>When a meeting or portion of a meeting is closed, the committee must still publish notice, but now must also explain which exemption applies and why. The idea is to make closure the exception rather than the rule, and to create a record that can be reviewed if someone suspects the exemption is being abused.</p>

<h2>Who Escapes the Net</h2>

<p>Several important bodies are explicitly excluded from the Act's requirements.</p>

<p>Committees composed entirely of full-time federal employees don't count as advisory committees under the law. The reasoning is that these are internal government deliberations, not outside advice.</p>

<p>Several specific organizations are also exempt. The Central Intelligence Agency was excluded for obvious national security reasons—the intelligence community argued that publicly noticing when they were seeking outside advice could itself reveal sensitive information about their priorities and concerns.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve System, which sets monetary policy for the United States, is also exempt. The independence of the central bank from political pressure is considered important enough to override transparency concerns.</p>

<p>Perhaps more surprisingly, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Public Administration are excluded. These prestigious institutions provide substantial advice to the federal government on technical and policy matters, but they operate under their own governance structures. Congress apparently trusted these established scientific bodies to maintain their own standards of rigor and openness.</p>

<h2>A 2012 Reality Check</h2>

<p>Four decades after the law's passage, the Government Accountability Office—Congress's investigative arm—took a hard look at how well it was working.</p>

<p>Their 2012 report focused on advisory groups at the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy. What they found was instructive.</p>

<p>There were over one thousand advisory committees operating under the Federal Advisory Committee Act across the federal government. But there was also an unknown number of groups operating outside the law's requirements—intergovernmental groups and other bodies that didn't trigger the Act's provisions. Nobody knew exactly how many.</p>

<p>The report identified a specific concern: duplication. Multiple committees were sometimes working on overlapping issues without coordination. The Government Accountability Office made four recommendations aimed at helping agencies identify when their advisory groups were duplicating each other's efforts.</p>

<p>This points to an irony in the law's success. The Act made advisory committees more legitimate by bringing them into the light, which may have encouraged their proliferation. When you can demonstrate that your advice came from a properly constituted, transparent process, that advice carries more weight. The result has been a vast ecosystem of committees that even the government struggles to fully map.</p>

<h2>Constitutional Controversies</h2>

<p>Not everyone believes the Federal Advisory Committee Act is constitutional.</p>

<p>The strongest criticism focuses on Article II of the Constitution, which establishes the President's executive powers. Critics argue that the President has an inherent right to seek advice from whomever they choose, and that Congress cannot dictate the terms on which the President receives information.</p>

<p>This argument treats the Act as an unconstitutional infringement on "long-recognized presidential powers." If the President wants to gather a group of experts in a private meeting and hear their frank assessments, shouldn't that be the President's choice? Forcing transparency onto those conversations might chill honest advice, as experts worry about how their comments will look when published.</p>

<p>The counterargument emphasizes that advisory committees aren't just presidential conversations. They're formal governmental processes that shape regulations affecting millions of Americans. When industry executives advise regulators on environmental rules, or pharmaceutical representatives advise on drug approvals, the public interest in transparency arguably outweighs presidential prerogatives.</p>

<p>Courts have generally upheld the Act, but the tension remains unresolved. Different administrations have taken different approaches to how aggressively they apply it, and legal scholars continue to debate where the constitutional lines should be drawn.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act was part of a broader revolution in American government during the 1970s. The Freedom of Information Act had passed in 1966, giving the public a right to request government documents. The Government in the Sunshine Act would follow in 1976, requiring many agency meetings to be open. Together, these laws represented a fundamental shift in assumptions about secrecy and democracy.</p>

<p>The backdrop was Watergate. President Nixon's resignation in 1974 came amid revelations of extraordinary government secrecy and deception. Public trust in government hit historic lows. The legislative response was to open as many doors as possible, betting that transparency would restore legitimacy.</p>

<p>Whether that bet paid off is still debated. Critics of transparency laws argue that they've driven real deliberation into informal channels that are harder to monitor, while creating elaborate compliance rituals that consume resources without producing genuine accountability. Supporters counter that whatever their limitations, these laws have exposed countless abuses that would otherwise have remained hidden.</p>

<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act occupies an interesting position in this debate. It tries to preserve the benefits of outside expertise—the government genuinely needs input from people who understand complex technical and policy questions—while preventing that expertise from becoming a cover for special-interest influence. It's a balancing act that every administration has to navigate.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>

<p>Understanding the Federal Advisory Committee Act is particularly important when thinking about how scientific and technical advice flows into government decisions.</p>

<p>Consider how the government evaluates scientific research proposals. Peer review—the process by which experts assess the quality of proposed studies—often happens through advisory mechanisms. The integrity of that process depends on both expertise and independence. Reviewers must understand the science well enough to evaluate it, but they must also be free from conflicts of interest that would bias their judgments.</p>

<p>The Act creates a framework for managing that tension. By requiring transparency about who serves on advisory committees and what they recommend, it provides a check against captured processes where regulators and regulated industries become too cozy. By allowing some closed sessions, it acknowledges that frank scientific discussion sometimes requires confidentiality.</p>

<p>When that framework is weakened or bypassed, the risk of capture increases. Industry representatives can shape advice without public scrutiny. Political appointees can override technical experts without leaving a record. The carefully constructed balance tips toward secrecy.</p>

<p>The Federal Advisory Committee Act isn't glamorous legislation. It doesn't have the dramatic profile of civil rights laws or constitutional amendments. But it shapes how expertise enters government, and expertise shapes policy. When you want to understand how a regulatory decision was made—whether a drug was approved, a chemical was permitted, a technology was deemed safe—the advisory committee process is often where you need to look.</p>

<p>The law ensures that when you look, you can actually see something.</p>

The essay transforms the dry Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative about government transparency. It opens with a compelling hook about shadow committees, explains the law's four pillars in accessible terms, covers the "locker room problem" that motivated the legislation, discusses exemptions and constitutional controversies, and connects it all to the broader Watergate-era transparency reforms. The final section ties it directly to the related Substack article about CDC peer review, making clear why this 1972 law matters for understanding how scientific expertise enters government decision-making.
