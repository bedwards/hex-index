        I've prepared a comprehensive rewritten article about knowledge graphs, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with a hook about Google's search cards rather than a dry definition
- Explains the mathematical concept of graphs in plain terms
- Traces the surprising linguistic origins of the term (coined by Austrian linguist Edgar Schneider in 1972)
- Chronicles the history from WordNet through DBpedia and Freebase to Google's 2012 Knowledge Graph
- Explains technical concepts like triple stores, ontologies, and embeddings in accessible language
- Covers the modern intersection with large language models and GraphRAG
- Runs approximately 18 minutes of reading time

However, I need write permission to save the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/knowledge-graph/index.html`. Could you grant permission for me to create this file?
