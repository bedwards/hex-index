        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article about Government Shutdowns in the United States. The article transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging 18-minute essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

Key features of the rewrite:
- **Opens with a hook** about the $24 billion cost of the 2013 shutdown and the irony of spending more to "save money"
- **Explains Benjamin Civiletti's role** in transforming funding gaps into shutdowns via his 1980 legal opinion
- **Covers the mechanics** of appropriations, continuing resolutions, and why the system is prone to failure
- **Distinguishes full vs. partial shutdowns** with the 2018-2019 example
- **Details what continues and what stops** during shutdowns
- **Presents economic data** showing shutdowns cost more than they save
- **Covers major shutdowns** from 1980 through the 43-day 2025 shutdown
- **Includes philosophical perspectives** from Peter Singer, Michael Shindler, Michelle Buehlmann, and Ezra Klein
- **Discusses reform proposals** including automatic continuing resolutions
- **Compares to other democracies** to show why this is uniquely American
