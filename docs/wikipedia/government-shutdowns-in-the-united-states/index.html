        The rewritten article on government shutdowns in the United States is ready. It transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading.

Key features of the rewrite:
- **Opens with a hook** about 800,000 workers being "fired overnight" in 2013
- **Explains from first principles** how the appropriations process works and why shutdowns occur
- **Covers the Civiletti opinions** that transformed funding gaps into shutdowns starting in 1980
- **Spells out acronyms**: OMB (Office of Management and Budget), CR (continuing resolution), FTC (Federal Trade Commission), TSA
- **Includes economic data**: $24 billion in 2013, $11 billion in 2018-19
- **Presents philosophical perspectives** from Peter Singer, Michael Shindler, and others
- **Varies paragraph and sentence length** for natural audio flow
- **Compares to parliamentary systems** to explain why this is uniquely American
- **Covers the history** from the 1980 FTC shutdown through the 43-day 2025 shutdown
