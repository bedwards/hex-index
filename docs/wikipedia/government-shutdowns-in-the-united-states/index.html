    <div class="content">
      <p>In October 2013, the United States government essentially fired 800,000 workers overnight. Not because of poor performance. Not because of budget cuts. Because politicians couldn't agree on a spending bill. Those workers weren't allowed to check their email. Federal marshals collected their government-issued phones and laptops. National parks closed. Museums shuttered. And the economy lost twenty-four billion dollars in a matter of weeks.</p>

      <p>This wasn't an anomaly. It was business as usual.</p>

      <p>The American government shutdown is one of the strangest features of modern democracy—a mechanism by which the world's wealthiest nation periodically stops paying its own employees and closes its own doors because its elected officials can't reach agreement. No other major democracy does this. And yet the United States has done it eleven times since 1980, with the shutdowns growing longer and more damaging over time.</p>

      <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>

      <p>The Constitution gives Congress—and only Congress—the power to spend money. This makes sense. The Founders didn't want a king who could raid the treasury whenever he pleased. They wanted the people's representatives to control the purse strings.</p>

      <p>But this created a problem. What happens when Congress can't agree on how much to spend, or when the President refuses to sign what Congress passes?</p>

      <p>For most of American history, the answer was: nothing dramatic. Government agencies would keep operating, assuming Congress would eventually work things out. They'd minimize non-essential activities and wait for the politicians to reach a deal.</p>

      <p>Then came Benjamin Civiletti.</p>

      <p>In 1980, Civiletti was the Attorney General under President Jimmy Carter. That April, he issued a legal opinion that changed everything. He looked at a law from 1870 called the Antideficiency Act—a law that makes it illegal for government officials to spend money they haven't been appropriated—and concluded that agencies couldn't just keep operating during funding gaps. They had to shut down.</p>

      <p>Five days after Civiletti's opinion, the Federal Trade Commission became the first agency in American history to close because of a budget dispute. About 1,600 workers were sent home. Federal Marshals showed up to lock the doors.</p>

      <p>The shutdown lasted one day. Carter threatened to close the entire government if Congress didn't get its act together, and they did. But a precedent had been set.</p>

      <h2>The Rules of the Game</h2>

      <p>Here's how it works in practice.</p>

      <p>The federal government runs on a fiscal year that begins October 1st. Before that date, Congress needs to pass twelve separate appropriations bills—one for each major category of government spending—and the President needs to sign them. If that doesn't happen, agencies lose their authority to spend money.</p>

      <p>There's an escape valve: the continuing resolution, usually abbreviated to "CR." This is a temporary measure that keeps funding flowing at existing levels while politicians continue negotiating. Think of it as hitting the snooze button on a funding deadline.</p>

      <p>But continuing resolutions can be blocked too. Any party to the negotiation—the President, the House of Representatives, or the Senate—can refuse to pass one. And when that happens, the government shuts down.</p>

      <p>Not completely, though. Civiletti's opinion, which he refined in 1981, carved out exceptions for what he called "life and property." Military personnel on active duty keep working. So do air traffic controllers, federal law enforcement, doctors and nurses in federal hospitals, and the scientists who run the National Weather Service. Anything that protects human life or property continues.</p>

      <p>But everyone else? They're sent home without pay. They're forbidden from working—even from checking email. And they wait.</p>

      <h2>The Human Cost</h2>

      <p>The numbers tell part of the story. During the 2013 shutdown, 800,000 employees were locked out while another 1.3 million kept working without knowing when they'd be paid. The 2018-2019 shutdown lasted thirty-five days—the longest in American history at that time—and affected roughly the same number of people.</p>

      <p>But the numbers don't capture what it feels like to be a federal employee during a shutdown.</p>

      <p>Imagine being told you cannot work, but you also cannot look for other work because the shutdown might end tomorrow. Imagine your mortgage payment coming due while your paycheck doesn't. Imagine being an air traffic controller—deemed "essential," required to show up—but with no idea when you'll actually be paid for keeping planes from crashing into each other.</p>

      <p>During the 2018-2019 shutdown, essential workers started calling in sick. Air travel delays mounted. The breaking point came when air traffic controllers at major airports simply stopped coming to work. Within days, the shutdown ended.</p>

      <h2>The Economic Damage</h2>

      <p>Government shutdowns cost more money than they save. This isn't a partisan claim—it's the assessment of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and virtually every economist who has studied the question.</p>

      <p>The 2018-2019 shutdown reduced economic growth by $11 billion total. About $3 billion of that was permanently lost—money that simply evaporated from the economy and would never come back. The 2013 shutdown shaved 0.6 percent off quarterly economic growth, costing roughly $24 billion.</p>

      <p>Where does this damage come from?</p>

      <p>Some of it is direct. National parks close, so tourists go elsewhere—or nowhere. Regulatory agencies stop processing applications, so businesses can't get the permits they need. Small Business Administration loans freeze, leaving entrepreneurs in limbo.</p>

      <p>Some of it is indirect. Consumer confidence drops when people see their government failing to function. Federal contractors—private companies that depend on government work—have to pay their employees to do nothing, or lay them off temporarily and pay the costs of rehiring later.</p>

      <p>And some of it is hidden. Scientific studies get interrupted and have to be restarted from scratch. Maintenance gets deferred, making future repairs more expensive. Immigration cases pile up, creating backlogs that take years to clear.</p>

      <p>The Office of Management and Budget estimated that the 2013 shutdown cost $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for furloughed employees who did no work—plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fee collections. That's money spent to accomplish nothing.</p>

      <h2>Full Shutdowns and Partial Shutdowns</h2>

      <p>There's an important distinction that often gets lost in the headlines. Not all shutdowns are created equal.</p>

      <p>A "full" shutdown means none of the twelve appropriations bills have been passed. The entire discretionary budget of the federal government—everything except mandatory spending programs like Social Security—grinds to a halt.</p>

      <p>A "partial" shutdown means some appropriations have passed but not others. Only the unfunded departments close. The 2018-2019 shutdown was partial: Congress had already passed five of the twelve appropriations bills, so only the remaining agencies—including the Department of Homeland Security, ironically, given that the fight was about border security—were affected.</p>

      <p>Partial shutdowns are still devastating for the affected agencies and their employees. But they're less visible to the general public, which means there's less pressure on politicians to resolve them quickly.</p>

      <h2>The Exceptions That Keep the Lights On</h2>

      <p>Understanding what continues during a shutdown reveals what the government considers absolutely essential.</p>

      <p>The military keeps operating. Active-duty service members remain at their posts, though civilian Defense Department employees—roughly half of them—get furloughed. The National Guard presents a quirky exception: full-time Guard members who serve in a "dual status" capacity, working both for the federal government and their state, get sent home.</p>

      <p>Law enforcement continues, though with reduced capacity. The FBI keeps investigating. Border Patrol keeps patrolling. But support staff disappear, meaning agents spend more time on paperwork and less time on actual law enforcement.</p>

      <p>Air traffic control continues—it has to—but the Federal Aviation Administration's safety inspectors often don't. During long shutdowns, this becomes a genuine safety concern.</p>

      <p>The Postal Service keeps delivering mail. Unlike most federal agencies, it's self-funded through stamp sales and other fees, so it doesn't depend on congressional appropriations.</p>

      <p>Congress keeps getting paid. The Constitution specifies that congressional compensation can only be changed by direct legislation, not by the appropriations process. This means that the people responsible for shutdowns are the only people guaranteed not to suffer from them financially—a fact that critics regularly point out.</p>

      <p>Social Security checks keep going out, but there's a catch. The program is funded by a dedicated payroll tax, not by annual appropriations. However, the staff who process new applications and handle problems are funded by appropriations. So existing beneficiaries are fine, but new applicants get stuck.</p>

      <h2>The Growing Pattern</h2>

      <p>If you look at the history of shutdowns, a disturbing pattern emerges: they're getting longer.</p>

      <p>The early shutdowns in the 1980s rarely lasted more than a few days. Some were measured in hours. Politicians used them as leverage, but they understood that extended shutdowns were genuinely harmful and politically dangerous.</p>

      <p>The 1995-1996 shutdown under President Bill Clinton changed the calculus. It lasted twenty-one days—unprecedented at the time—as Republicans in Congress fought Clinton over spending cuts. Clinton won that battle politically, but the shutdown demonstrated that a party could survive a lengthy standoff if it believed public opinion was on its side.</p>

      <p>The 2013 shutdown under President Barack Obama lasted sixteen days. Republicans were trying to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. They failed, but again, the political lesson seemed to be that shutdowns were survivable.</p>

      <p>Then came 2018-2019. President Donald Trump demanded funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats refused. The shutdown stretched to thirty-five days, affecting hundreds of thousands of workers through the holiday season. It ended only when air travel disruptions became so severe that the practical consequences outweighed the political calculations.</p>

      <p>And then, starting October 1, 2025, came an even longer shutdown during Trump's second presidency—forty-three days, the longest in American history.</p>

      <h2>Why Does This Keep Happening?</h2>

      <p>The obvious answer is that shutdowns are a form of political leverage. They're brinkmanship—a way for one party to force the other to accept policies they would otherwise reject.</p>

      <p>But that raises a deeper question: why does this tactic work?</p>

      <p>Part of the answer lies in the Constitution itself. The American system of separated powers was designed to make action difficult. The Founders wanted to prevent tyranny, and they succeeded—but the same barriers that prevent tyranny also prevent compromise. When different branches of government are controlled by different parties with incompatible priorities, the system can deadlock.</p>

      <p>The philosopher Peter Singer, writing during the 2013 shutdown, called this "a fundamental flaw" in the Constitution. The system works well when there's enough consensus to pass legislation, but it has no good mechanism for resolving disputes when that consensus doesn't exist.</p>

      <p>Others see it differently. The conservative writer Michael Shindler argued in 2019 that shutdowns, paradoxically, protect democracy. They force the country to confront its divisions. They make visible what might otherwise remain hidden: the depth of disagreement between competing visions of government.</p>

      <p>"During a shutdown," Shindler wrote, "the government, which is bound by elaborate mechanisms to the national will, becomes confused. For a moment, it seems as if the march of American history is at a standstill."</p>

      <p>The journalist Ezra Klein offered yet another perspective in September 2025, arguing that a shutdown could be a form of resistance—a refusal to fund a government one believes to be acting corruptly. In this view, the chaos of a shutdown is a feature, not a bug: it draws attention to what's wrong.</p>

      <h2>Proposals for Reform</h2>

      <p>Politicians from both parties have proposed ending the shutdown mechanism entirely. The most popular approach: automatic continuing resolutions.</p>

      <p>Under this reform, if Congress fails to pass appropriations bills by the deadline, funding would automatically continue at prior-year levels. There would be no shutdown, no furloughs, no economic damage. Politicians could still fight over the budget, but the fight wouldn't hold government workers and services hostage.</p>

      <p>One version of this proposal would also require members of Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to remain in Washington, D.C., until new appropriations are enacted. No going home for the holidays until the budget is done. Polling in September 2025 found 76 percent support for this approach, with only 6 percent opposed.</p>

      <p>So far, these reforms haven't passed. Perhaps that's because the shutdown mechanism, as destructive as it is, serves the interests of politicians who want leverage. Giving up that leverage means accepting compromise—and in an era of increasing polarization, compromise has become a dirty word.</p>

      <h2>What Makes America Different</h2>

      <p>It's worth stepping back to notice how strange this is.</p>

      <p>Other democracies don't do this. In parliamentary systems like the United Kingdom or Canada, the government that controls the legislature also controls the executive branch. They can't deadlock with themselves. If a budget fails to pass, it typically triggers an election—not a shutdown.</p>

      <p>Even in presidential systems more similar to America's, shutdowns are rare or nonexistent. Most countries have constitutional or statutory mechanisms that keep funding flowing during budget disputes.</p>

      <p>The United States is unique in allowing—even encouraging—its government to periodically stop functioning as a negotiating tactic. It's a feature of American governance that looks increasingly dysfunctional as shutdowns grow longer and more damaging.</p>

      <h2>The First Shutdown</h2>

      <p>The story of how we got here begins with a single agency: the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

      <p>It was May 1, 1980. Congress was unhappy with the FTC's aggressive oversight of business practices. They wanted to limit the agency's power to investigate and make rules. To force the issue, they delayed funding.</p>

      <p>Under the old interpretation of the law, the FTC would have kept operating, waiting for Congress to work things out. But Attorney General Civiletti's new opinion changed that. For the first time, a federal agency closed its doors because of a budget dispute.</p>

      <p>The shutdown lasted exactly one day. President Carter's threat to close the entire government concentrated congressional minds wonderfully. But the precedent was established. Shutdowns were now possible—and they would become an increasingly familiar feature of American political life.</p>

      <p>The estimated cost of that one-day shutdown? About $700,000, mostly in back pay for workers who were sent home and then had to be paid anyway. It was a preview of what was to come: expensive theater that accomplished nothing except demonstrating that politicians were willing to harm government workers and the public to make a point.</p>

      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

      <p>As of this writing, the United States has experienced eleven significant government shutdowns since 1980. They've grown longer, more damaging, and more frequent. The political incentives that produce them show no signs of changing.</p>

      <p>Some observers believe the pattern will continue until the damage becomes so severe that reform becomes unavoidable. Others worry that Americans have simply become accustomed to dysfunction—that shutdowns, like so many other features of polarized politics, have been normalized.</p>

      <p>What's certain is that the current system imposes real costs on real people. Eight hundred thousand workers sent home. Billions of dollars lost. Scientific research destroyed. Government services delayed.</p>

      <p>All because the system designed to prevent tyranny has, in this particular way, prevented governance itself.</p>
