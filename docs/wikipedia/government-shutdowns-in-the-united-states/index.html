        I've written the complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on government shutdowns. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging 18-minute read optimized for Speechify.

Key features of the rewrite:

- **Compelling hook**: Opens with the panda cam going dark during the 2013 shutdown, making the abstract tangible
- **Clear explanations**: Traces the history from Benjamin Civiletti's 1980 legal opinion that accidentally created modern shutdowns
- **Varied rhythm**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones for natural audio flow
- **Economic context**: Includes specific figures like the $24 billion cost of 2013, $11 billion for 2018-2019
- **All four major shutdowns covered**: 1995-96, 2013, 2018-19, and the 43-day 2025 shutdown
- **Philosophical perspectives**: Peter Singer's critique, Michael Shindler's defense, Ezra Klein's provocation
- **International comparison**: Explains why other democracies don't have this problem
- **Memorable conclusion**: Returns to the panda cam image, tying the piece together

The file is ready to save once you grant write permission to the `docs/wikipedia/government-shutdowns-in-the-united-states/` directory.
