<p>In 1966, a company that made car bumpers bought Hollywood.</p>

<p>This sounds like the setup to a joke, but it's the origin story of one of the most consequential media empires in American history. Gulf and Western Industries—a conglomerate that started life as the Michigan Bumper Corporation—would go on to own Paramount Pictures, Simon & Schuster, Sega, Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers, a sugar refinery that was once the largest in the world, zinc mines, cigar factories, and at one point, a casket company.</p>

<p>The story of Gulf and Western is the story of a particular moment in American capitalism: the conglomerate era, when ambitious businessmen believed that good management could run any business, regardless of whether it made movies or mined metals. It's also the story of how the entertainment industry we know today was assembled—piece by piece, acquisition by acquisition—by people who often had no background in entertainment at all.</p>

<h2>The Man Who Bought Everything</h2>

<p>Charles Bluhdorn was born in Vienna in 1926 and emigrated to the United States as a teenager. By his mid-twenties, he had made his first fortune trading cotton commodities. But Bluhdorn wasn't interested in trading commodities forever. He wanted to build something.</p>

<p>In 1956, Bluhdorn took over a small company called Michigan Plating and Stamping. The business was exactly as unglamorous as its name suggests: it made metal parts for automobiles. But Bluhdorn saw it as a platform, a base from which to launch something much bigger.</p>

<p>Within two years, he had acquired a Texas electrical company and renamed the whole enterprise Gulf and Western Corporation—a name meant to evoke the Gulf of Mexico (near Houston, where his new acquisition was based) and the Western United States (where the auto industry was expanding). Bluhdorn considered this 1958 renaming to be the company's true founding, and he celebrated anniversaries accordingly. The bumper-making past was conveniently forgotten.</p>

<p>What followed was one of the most aggressive acquisition sprees in American business history.</p>

<h2>The Conglomerate Theory</h2>

<p>To understand what Bluhdorn was doing, you need to understand the conglomerate theory that dominated American business thinking in the 1960s. The idea was simple: a well-managed company could run any kind of business profitably. The specific industry didn't matter. What mattered was having smart executives who could read financial statements, cut costs, and allocate capital efficiently.</p>

<p>This theory led to some bizarre corporate combinations. ITT, another famous conglomerate of the era, owned Hartford Insurance, Sheraton Hotels, Continental Baking (which made Wonder Bread), and various telecommunications companies. The logic was that diversification reduced risk—if one industry suffered a downturn, profits from other industries would compensate.</p>

<p>Gulf and Western embraced this philosophy with abandon. Between 1958 and 1982, Bluhdorn acquired companies at a pace that would exhaust a modern private equity firm. The holdings ranged from auto parts manufacturers to zinc mines to cigar companies to fertilizer plants. There was no obvious connection between these businesses except that Bluhdorn thought he could make money from them.</p>

<p>Consider just a partial list from the early years: a company that made electric transformers (Unicord, 1959), a mine in Canada (Hedman Mines, 1967), a sugar company in Puerto Rico (South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, 1967), a cigar manufacturer (Consolidated Cigar Corporation, 1968), and a fire alarm company (Gamewell, acquired as part of E.W. Bliss Company in 1968).</p>

<p>But the acquisition that would define Gulf and Western's future—and reshape the entertainment industry—came in 1966.</p>

<h2>The Paramount Deal</h2>

<p>When Gulf and Western bought Paramount Pictures for $125 million, the studio was in trouble. It had stopped producing television programs and was bleeding money on feature films. To outsiders, it looked like a declining asset in a changing industry.</p>

<p>Bluhdorn saw something different. He saw hidden value.</p>

<p>Paramount owned extensive real estate in Los Angeles—land that was worth far more than the company's stock price suggested. It owned a library of old movies that could be sold to television networks, which were hungry for content to fill their expanding broadcast schedules. And it owned something even more valuable: the rights to make new movies and television shows under one of the most famous brand names in entertainment.</p>

<p>The deal was transformative for Gulf and Western. Before Paramount, the company was an obscure industrial conglomerate. After Paramount, it was a player. Sales jumped to $450 million, vaulting Gulf and Western into the top 110 manufacturing companies in the United States.</p>

<p>Bluhdorn, never one for modesty, appointed himself chief executive officer, chairman, and president of Paramount. He promoted a young executive named Martin S. Davis to chief operating officer. Davis would eventually succeed Bluhdorn and transform Gulf and Western into something completely different—but that was still years away.</p>

<h2>Building an Entertainment Empire</h2>

<p>The Paramount acquisition came with several valuable properties that would prove more important than anyone initially realized.</p>

<p>There was Dot Records, a country music label. There was Famous Music, a publishing company that had been created in 1928 by Famous Players–Lasky Corporation, Paramount's corporate ancestor. There was the Famous Players movie theater chain in Canada. And there was Famous Studios, an animation studio that Gulf and Western promptly shut down—a decision that seems shortsighted in hindsight, given how valuable animation would become.</p>

<p>But Gulf and Western wasn't finished building its entertainment portfolio.</p>

<p>In 1967, Bluhdorn bought Desilu Productions from Lucille Ball. Desilu was the production company Ball had built with her ex-husband Desi Arnaz, and its library included some of television's most valuable properties: Star Trek, Mission: Impossible, and of course the various Lucille Ball series that had made the company famous.</p>

<p>The Desilu acquisition also included three studio lots, including the original RKO Studios. However, the Justice Department—concerned about monopolistic control of Hollywood production facilities—forced Gulf and Western to sell one of the Culver City locations. The remaining properties were absorbed into Paramount, and Desilu Productions was renamed Paramount Television.</p>

<p>This is worth pausing on: the production company that created Star Trek was renamed after a movie studio that was owned by a car bumper manufacturer. The entertainment industry's corporate genealogy is rarely straightforward.</p>

<h2>The Sega Connection</h2>

<p>In 1969, Gulf and Western acquired Sega, a company that at the time made arcade machines.</p>

<p>This might seem like an odd fit for a conglomerate that owned zinc mines and cigar factories, but it made sense in the context of Gulf and Western's entertainment holdings. Arcade games were a form of entertainment, and Gulf and Western was now in the entertainment business.</p>

<p>Sega would remain part of Gulf and Western throughout the 1970s, during which time the company transitioned from mechanical arcade games to the new technology of video games. In 1978, Gulf and Western also acquired Gremlin Industries, another arcade game manufacturer, and merged it into Sega Electronics.</p>

<p>The video game industry was still in its infancy, and no one could have predicted how important it would become. Gulf and Western would eventually sell Sega—a decision that, in retrospect, left billions of dollars on the table. But that's the nature of conglomerate management: you can't predict which of your dozens of holdings will become world-changing industries.</p>

<h2>Madison Square Garden and the Sports Business</h2>

<p>In 1977, Gulf and Western made another acquisition that would have lasting cultural significance: Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>The package was extraordinary. Along with the arena itself—arguably the most famous sports venue in America—Gulf and Western acquired the New York Rangers hockey team, the New York Knicks basketball team, and Holiday on Ice, the touring ice show. The deal also included horse racing tracks, hotels, and valuable real estate in Manhattan, Long Island, and Chicago.</p>

<p>This was Gulf and Western at the height of its ambition: a single company owning movie studios, television production, book publishers, record labels, professional sports teams, and the arena where those teams played. The synergies seemed obvious, at least in theory. Paramount could produce shows at Madison Square Garden. The sports teams could be featured in films and television programs. The whole enterprise could cross-promote itself endlessly.</p>

<p>Whether these synergies ever materialized in practice is another question. Conglomerates often discovered that the businesses they owned didn't actually benefit from being under common ownership. A movie studio and a zinc mine have very little to say to each other.</p>

<h2>The Dominican Republic Operations</h2>

<p>One of the more unusual aspects of Gulf and Western's empire was its extensive presence in the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Through its 1967 acquisition of South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, Gulf and Western gained control of Central Romana Corporation, a major sugar producer in La Romana, Dominican Republic. The company didn't just grow sugar cane—it essentially ran the town. Central Romana employed thousands of workers and controlled much of the local economy.</p>

<p>In 1969, Gulf and Western and the Dominican government established an industrial free zone in La Romana, creating a special economic area with tax advantages designed to attract manufacturing. The zone was administered by a Gulf and Western subsidiary with the unwieldy name of Operadora Zona Franca de La Romana.</p>

<p>Gulf and Western also established Consolidated Domingo to produce cigars in the Dominican Republic, expanding its existing cigar business (which it had acquired through Consolidated Cigar Corporation in 1968) into the Caribbean.</p>

<p>This Caribbean empire was controversial. Labor activists criticized working conditions in the sugar fields and the company's influence over local politics. Gulf and Western was essentially a state within a state, with economic power that rivaled or exceeded the Dominican government's in certain regions.</p>

<h2>Environmental Liabilities: The Hidden Cost</h2>

<p>Not everything Gulf and Western touched turned to gold. Some of it turned into Superfund sites.</p>

<p>In 1966, Gulf and Western acquired the New Jersey Zinc Company, a major zinc producer with mines and processing facilities across the United States. Zinc mining, like most heavy industrial operations of the era, left significant environmental damage.</p>

<p>The Eagle mine, which came with the New Jersey Zinc acquisition, was eventually designated a Superfund site—a designation reserved for the most contaminated locations in America, requiring extensive federal cleanup. Years later, the Environmental Protection Agency (commonly known as the EPA) identified Viacom International as the successor in interest to the mine. Viacom had acquired Gulf and Western's assets through a corporate chain of transactions, and with those assets came responsibility for decades-old environmental damage.</p>

<p>In 1967, New Jersey Zinc constructed a fertilizer plant in DePue, Illinois that would also become a Superfund site. That cleanup eventually involved CBS and ExxonMobil as responsible parties—another reminder that corporate acquisitions can create liabilities that persist for decades.</p>

<p>These environmental costs are rarely factored into the stories we tell about corporate empire-builders like Bluhdorn. But they're real, and they're still being paid for today.</p>

<h2>Hollywood Joint Ventures</h2>

<p>In the early 1970s, something remarkable happened: Gulf and Western's Paramount and MCA's Universal decided to cooperate.</p>

<p>The two studios merged their international distribution operations to create Cinema International Corporation. The arrangement came about after a lunch meeting between Bluhdorn and Lew Wasserman, the legendary head of MCA who was arguably the most powerful man in Hollywood.</p>

<p>United Artists later joined the joint venture, which evolved into United International Pictures. This company handled the overseas distribution of films from all three studios, pooling their resources to compete more effectively in foreign markets.</p>

<p>The joint venture was unusual for Hollywood, where studios typically competed fiercely with each other. But it reflected a practical reality: international distribution was expensive and complicated, and even major studios could benefit from sharing the costs.</p>

<p>United International Pictures would continue operating for decades, eventually becoming one of the largest film distributors in the world outside North America.</p>

<h2>The Record Label Adventures</h2>

<p>Gulf and Western's involvement in the music industry was complicated and somewhat chaotic.</p>

<p>Paramount Records—not to be confused with an earlier, unrelated label of the same name—was created in 1969 to handle non-country music from the Paramount stable. Dot Records, which came with the Paramount acquisition, was repositioned as a country music label. The company also acquired Stax Records in 1968, one of the most important soul music labels in America.</p>

<p>Stax was home to artists like Otis Redding, Isaac Hayes, and Booker T. & the M.G.'s. It had helped define the Memphis soul sound and was culturally significant far beyond its commercial success. But Gulf and Western's ownership was brief and troubled. In 1970, the company sold Stax back to its original owners, though the rights to recordings made during Gulf and Western's ownership remained with Atlantic Records, which had distributed Stax.</p>

<p>The Stax situation illustrates a recurring problem with conglomerate ownership of creative businesses. Gulf and Western executives understood balance sheets and manufacturing processes. They didn't necessarily understand what made a soul music label special, or why artists might chafe under corporate ownership.</p>

<p>Gulf and Western also briefly owned Tumbleweed Records, a label formed in 1971 with financial backing from the conglomerate. It operated as a subsidiary of Famous Music until 1973, when it folded. Most people have never heard of Tumbleweed Records, which tells you something about how it worked out.</p>

<h2>Simon & Schuster and the Publishing Business</h2>

<p>In 1975, Gulf and Western acquired Simon & Schuster, one of the most prestigious book publishers in America.</p>

<p>Simon & Schuster had been founded in 1924 by Richard Simon and Max Schuster. It had published books by everyone from Dale Carnegie to Joseph Heller. Its imprints included Pocket Books (one of the first paperback publishers in America), Washington Square Press, and various other labels.</p>

<p>The acquisition gave Gulf and Western a presence in publishing that complemented its entertainment holdings. Books could be adapted into films. Authors could be promoted across the company's various media properties. Or so the theory went.</p>

<p>In practice, Simon & Schuster operated fairly independently of Gulf and Western's other businesses. Book publishing has its own rhythms and economics, and conglomerate owners have generally learned to leave publishers alone—at least if they want the publishers to remain successful.</p>

<h2>The Kayser-Roth Acquisition and Miss Universe</h2>

<p>Sometimes corporate acquisitions come with unexpected bonuses. When Gulf and Western bought Kayser-Roth Corporation in 1975, it thought it was acquiring a clothing company.</p>

<p>Which it was. Kayser-Roth made apparel. But Kayser-Roth had previously acquired Pacific Mills, a textile company that had invented the Miss Universe pageant to promote its Catalina swimwear brand. So when Gulf and Western bought Kayser-Roth, it also became the owner of Miss Universe.</p>

<p>The deal also included Hammacher Schlemmer, the specialty retailer known for selling unusual and expensive gadgets. Hammacher Schlemmer had been acquired by Kayser-Roth in 1960, and it came along with the package.</p>

<p>This is how conglomerates work: you buy a clothing company and end up owning a beauty pageant and a gadget store. The connections between holdings can be entirely accidental.</p>

<h2>The Death of Bluhdorn and the End of an Era</h2>

<p>Charles Bluhdorn died in 1983, at the age of 56, on an airplane returning from the Dominican Republic. His death marked the end of the conglomerate-building phase of Gulf and Western's history.</p>

<p>Martin S. Davis, who had risen through the ranks since the Paramount acquisition, took over as chairman and CEO. Davis had a different vision for the company. He didn't believe in the conglomerate theory that had guided Bluhdorn's acquisition spree. He believed in focus.</p>

<p>Over the course of the 1980s, Davis systematically sold off Gulf and Western's industrial holdings. The zinc mines went. The auto parts businesses went. The sugar operations went. The cigar companies went. The financial services businesses went.</p>

<p>What remained was entertainment and publishing: Paramount Pictures, Paramount Television, Madison Square Garden, Simon & Schuster, and related properties. This was a very different company from the one Bluhdorn had built—narrower but more coherent.</p>

<p>In 1989, the transformation was completed. Gulf and Western changed its name to Paramount Communications, erasing even the memory of the industrial conglomerate. The bumper manufacturer that had bought Hollywood was finally, officially, just a Hollywood company.</p>

<h2>The Viacom Merger and Modern Paramount</h2>

<p>In 1994, Viacom acquired a controlling interest in Paramount Communications.</p>

<p>Viacom was itself a media company, with holdings that included MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and Showtime. The merger combined two major entertainment enterprises into a single company.</p>

<p>The subsequent corporate history is complicated—involving splits, mergers, and recombinations that would take pages to fully explain. But the entertainment assets that Gulf and Western assembled are today part of Paramount Global (as the company is now known), which in 2024 merged with Skydance Media to form Paramount Skydance Corporation.</p>

<p>The Star Trek franchise that Gulf and Western acquired through Desilu is still being produced. The Paramount mountain logo still appears before films. Simon & Schuster (though it was eventually sold off) remained one of the Big Five publishers. The legacy of that 1966 acquisition—when a car bumper company bought a struggling movie studio—continues to shape American entertainment.</p>

<h2>What the Conglomerate Era Teaches Us</h2>

<p>Gulf and Western's story is a window into a particular moment in American capitalism—a moment when diversification was seen as the path to safety and size was seen as the path to power.</p>

<p>The conglomerate theory turned out to be mostly wrong. Companies that tried to manage wildly different businesses under one roof usually discovered that the businesses didn't benefit from common ownership. Managers who understood manufacturing didn't understand entertainment. Synergies that looked obvious on paper rarely materialized in practice.</p>

<p>By the 1980s, the conglomerate era was ending. Corporate raiders began breaking up conglomerates and selling the pieces for more than the whole had been worth. Focus became the new religion: companies were supposed to do one thing well, not many things adequately.</p>

<p>Gulf and Western's transformation into Paramount Communications was part of this shift. Martin Davis wasn't wrong to sell the zinc mines and the sugar plantations. Those businesses had no obvious connection to making movies.</p>

<p>But here's the strange thing: some of the acquisitions that seemed most random turned out to be most valuable. Gulf and Western bought Sega when it was making arcade games, years before anyone understood what video games would become. It bought Madison Square Garden, which remains one of the most valuable sports and entertainment properties in America. It assembled a collection of entertainment assets that, properly managed, would have been worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Charles Bluhdorn was not a visionary in the usual sense. He wasn't trying to build the future of entertainment. He was trying to buy undervalued assets and manage them profitably. But in the process, he accidentally assembled many of the pieces that would define American popular culture for the next half-century.</p>

<p>That's perhaps the most interesting lesson of Gulf and Western's story: sometimes the most consequential decisions are made by people who don't fully understand what they're doing. Bluhdorn bought Paramount because he saw hidden value in its real estate and film library. He bought Desilu because television production seemed profitable. He bought Sega because arcade games made money.</p>

<p>He didn't know he was building the foundation of a media empire that would outlast him by decades. He was just buying things. And sometimes, that's enough.</p>
