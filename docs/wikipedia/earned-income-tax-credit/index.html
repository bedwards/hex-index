<h2>The Government Pays You to Work</h2>

<p>Here's something counterintuitive about the American tax system: for millions of workers, filing their taxes doesn't mean sending money to the government. It means the government sends money to them—sometimes thousands of dollars more than they paid in.</p>

<p>This isn't a glitch or a loophole. It's the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, and it's become one of the largest anti-poverty programs in the United States. The key word is "earned." You have to work to get it. And that simple requirement has made the EITC oddly popular across the political spectrum in a way that few government programs ever manage.</p>

<h2>The Economics of Paying People to Work</h2>

<p>Traditional welfare programs have always faced a brutal criticism: they pay people not to work. Get a job, lose your benefits. This creates what economists call a "poverty trap"—a situation where taking a low-paying job can actually leave you worse off financially than staying unemployed.</p>

<p>The EITC flips this logic entirely. Instead of reducing benefits when you earn money, the credit increases as you earn more—up to a point. For a family with three children in 2023, every additional dollar of earnings up to about $17,000 added an extra 45 cents from the government. That's like getting a 45% bonus on top of your paycheck.</p>

<p>Think about what that means. A single mother working a minimum wage job isn't just earning her hourly rate. The government is effectively topping up her paycheck by nearly half again. The EITC transforms low-wage work from barely survivable into something closer to a living.</p>

<p>Of course, no benefit can last forever. After reaching its maximum value, the credit holds steady through a "plateau" phase, then gradually phases out as income rises further. The phase-out is gentler than the phase-in—typically around 21% for families with multiple children. So for every additional dollar you earn during the phase-out, you lose about 21 cents of credit. You're still better off earning more, just not by as much.</p>

<h2>A Nixon Idea That Democrats Love</h2>

<p>The EITC's origin story is stranger than most government programs.</p>

<p>In 1969, Richard Nixon—a Republican president not typically associated with expanding the welfare state—proposed something called the Family Assistance Plan. It would have guaranteed a minimum income to every American family, structured as a "negative income tax." If your income fell below a certain threshold, instead of paying taxes, you'd receive a payment.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives passed it. The Senate killed it. But the idea didn't die.</p>

<p>During the 1972 presidential campaign, George McGovern went even further, proposing a "demogrant" of $1,000 for every American—adults and children alike. Critics savaged the idea. Where was the requirement to work? Where was the stigma that they believed should accompany government assistance?</p>

<p>The debate was genuinely fierce. A Hawaiian state senator argued that the state's residency requirements for public aid were necessary to discourage "parasites in paradise." This language sounds shocking today, but it reflected genuine anxiety about whether cash assistance would undermine the work ethic.</p>

<p>Senator Russell Long of Louisiana found a middle path. What if the government only subsidized people who were already working? That preserved the moral requirement to labor while still helping the working poor.</p>

<p>President Gerald Ford signed Long's earned income tax credit into law in 1975, buried within the Tax Reduction Act. The original version was modest: a maximum credit of $400 for families earning under $4,000, phasing out entirely by $8,000 in annual income. You needed at least one dependent child to qualify.</p>

<h2>The Expansion Nobody Could Stop</h2>

<p>What happened next is remarkable. The EITC kept getting bigger—under both parties, under both tax-raising and tax-cutting legislation.</p>

<p>The Tax Reform Act of 1986, famous for flattening rates and eliminating deductions, expanded the EITC. The deficit-reduction packages of 1990 and 1993, which raised taxes overall, expanded it further. The tax cuts of 2001 expanded it again.</p>

<p>The 1993 expansion under President Bill Clinton was especially dramatic—he tripled the credit. This is the same legislation referenced in discussions about Clinton's fiscal success in the 1990s. While Clinton was raising taxes on high earners and cutting the deficit, he was simultaneously expanding a program that sent billions to low-wage workers. The EITC became a key piece of how Clinton could claim to be reforming welfare "as we know it" while actually increasing aid to the working poor.</p>

<p>By 2011, when the American Economic Association surveyed its members, about 60% of economists agreed the EITC should be expanded further. By 2021, that number had climbed to 90%. It's hard to find anything that 90% of economists agree on, but the EITC comes close.</p>

<h2>Who Qualifies and How Much They Get</h2>

<p>The EITC's value depends primarily on two factors: how much you earn and how many children you have.</p>

<p>Families with children get far more than childless adults. This isn't accidental—the program was originally designed exclusively for families with dependents. Childless workers weren't eligible at all until later expansions, and even now they receive a much smaller credit with tighter income limits.</p>

<p>For the 2021 tax year, a single adult with no children could claim EITC only if they earned less than about $21,430 (roughly $27,380 for married couples filing jointly). The maximum credit for such workers was just a few hundred dollars.</p>

<p>But families with three or more children could qualify with income up to around $57,000, and their maximum credit exceeded $6,700. That's real money—potentially the difference between making rent and not making rent, between a reliable car and an unreliable one.</p>

<p>The 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in response to the Great Recession, temporarily created a new tier specifically for larger families. Instead of phasing in at 40% of income, families with three or more children saw their credit phase in at 45%. This increased their maximum credit by almost $600. Congress extended this expansion multiple times before making it permanent.</p>

<h2>The Marriage Penalty Problem</h2>

<p>Tax policy has a recurring problem: marriage penalties. When two people with similar incomes marry and file jointly, they often face higher taxes than if they'd stayed single and filed separately. The EITC has historically had the same issue.</p>

<p>Two single parents, each with one child and earning $20,000, might both receive substantial EITC benefits. If they marry, their combined $40,000 income could push them into the phase-out range much faster, costing them thousands of dollars in lost credits.</p>

<p>Congress has repeatedly tried to soften this penalty. The income threshold at which the EITC begins phasing out for married couples is now $5,000 higher than for single filers. But the combined range for married couples still isn't double that of single filers. The marriage penalty persists—it's just less severe than it used to be.</p>

<h2>The Qualifying Child Rules: Surprisingly Complex</h2>

<p>For something that sounds simple—"do you have a qualifying child?"—the rules can become labyrinthine.</p>

<p>A qualifying child must meet three tests: relationship, age, and residency.</p>

<p>The relationship test is broader than you might expect. Your qualifying child can be your son, daughter, stepchild, grandchild, great-grandchild, brother, sister, half-sibling, stepsibling, niece, nephew, or even further descendants. Foster children count if officially placed. Children in the process of being adopted count if lawfully placed.</p>

<p>The age test has several components. Generally, the child must be under 19 at the end of the tax year. But full-time students can be up to 23 years old. And if the "child" is classified as permanently and totally disabled—meaning a physician has determined they cannot engage in substantial gainful activity and this condition has lasted or will last at least a year—there's no age limit at all.</p>

<p>The residency test requires the child to live with you in the United States for more than half the year—six months and one day. Military personnel stationed overseas on extended active duty are considered to live in the U.S. for this purpose. Temporary absences, like for school or medical treatment, don't break the residency requirement.</p>

<h3>When Multiple People Could Claim the Same Child</h3>

<p>Extended family situations create complications. Imagine a grandmother, a mother, and an uncle all living together with a young child. All three might initially meet the relationship, age, and residency requirements to claim that child.</p>

<p>The tiebreaker rules work as follows. Parents always win over non-parents. If two parents could claim the child, the one who lived with the child longest wins. If two non-parents could claim the child, the one with the higher adjusted gross income wins.</p>

<p>But here's an interesting wrinkle: parents can voluntarily waive their claim and let a non-parent claim the child—but only if that non-parent has a higher adjusted gross income than any parent who lived with the child for at least six months. Sometimes it makes financial sense for a grandparent in a higher tax bracket to claim the child and share the resulting benefit with the whole family.</p>

<h3>The Young Parent Exception</h3>

<p>There's a peculiar rule affecting young single parents in extended family situations.</p>

<p>If you're a single parent under 19 living with your own parents, you might be claimable as a "qualifying child" by your parents—which would disqualify you from claiming EITC with your own child. The same applies if you're under 24 and a full-time student.</p>

<p>However, this rule doesn't apply to married couples. Even if both spouses are teenagers, they can claim EITC with their child as long as they file jointly.</p>

<h2>What Counts as Earned Income</h2>

<p>The word "earned" is doing a lot of work in the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>

<p>Earned income means income received through personal effort. Wages, salaries, tips, and commissions all count. Net earnings from self-employment count. Even certain disability payments count—but only if they're from a private employer's plan and received before minimum retirement age.</p>

<p>Here's something unexpected: nontaxable combat pay for military service can be counted as earned income for EITC purposes, but it's an all-or-none election. You must choose to include all of your combat pay or none of it.</p>

<p>What doesn't count? Investment income, rental income, alimony, pensions, Social Security, and worker's compensation. These are considered "passive" or "unearned" income. You can still receive these while claiming EITC, but they don't help you qualify, and too much investment income can actually disqualify you entirely.</p>

<h2>The Investment Income Cliff</h2>

<p>The EITC handles investment income inelegantly. While earned income phases in and out gradually, investment income creates a cliff. Cross a certain threshold—$10,000 for recent years—and you lose the entire credit, all at once.</p>

<p>This creates bizarre incentives. Someone might be better off financially if they earned slightly less investment income. A modest stock sale or a few thousand in interest could cost thousands in EITC benefits. It's one of the program's design flaws that neither party has managed to fix.</p>

<h2>State-Level Credits</h2>

<p>The federal EITC has inspired imitators at the state level. As of 2025, 31 states plus the District of Columbia have their own earned income credits. California, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, and many others offer additional credits that stack on top of the federal benefit.</p>

<p>Some state credits are refundable—meaning you get the money even if you owe no state taxes. Others are non-refundable, which helps only those with state tax liability.</p>

<p>A handful of localities have gotten in on the act too. New York City, San Francisco, and Montgomery County, Maryland all have local earned income credits.</p>

<p>For a low-income family in a generous state, the combined federal, state, and local credits can total well over $10,000—a substantial addition to their annual income.</p>

<h2>The Minimum Wage Debate</h2>

<p>The EITC often enters debates about raising the minimum wage. Some economists argue that expanding the EITC is superior to hiking minimum wages because it targets help more precisely. A minimum wage increase helps all workers earning less than the new minimum, including teenagers from wealthy families working summer jobs. The EITC directs money specifically to low-income working families.</p>

<p>Moreover, minimum wage increases are paid entirely by employers, which might reduce employment. The EITC is paid by the federal government out of general revenue.</p>

<p>Other economists counter that the two policies are complementary, not substitutes. Without a minimum wage floor, employers might capture EITC benefits by lowering wages, knowing the government will make up the difference.</p>

<p>The truth is probably that both tools are useful, serving somewhat different purposes. The EITC does nothing for a childless adult who doesn't qualify or whose income is too low to gain much benefit. The minimum wage helps everyone who earns it.</p>

<h2>Marginal Tax Rates and the Phase-Out Problem</h2>

<p>There's a subtle issue during the EITC's phase-out range. Every additional dollar of earnings reduces your credit by 15-21 cents. That's equivalent to a hidden tax rate of 15-21% on top of whatever regular income and payroll taxes you owe.</p>

<p>For someone in the phase-out range who also qualifies for other means-tested programs—food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance—these phase-outs can stack. In extreme cases, someone might face an effective marginal tax rate approaching or even exceeding 100%. Earn an extra dollar, lose more than a dollar in benefits.</p>

<p>These "benefit cliffs" represent a persistent challenge in antipoverty policy. The EITC's gradual phase-out is actually designed to minimize this problem compared to older welfare programs with sharper cutoffs. But when multiple programs interact, the problem reemerges.</p>

<h2>The Paperwork</h2>

<p>Claiming the EITC requires filling out Schedule EIC if you have qualifying children. This form asks for each child's name, Social Security number, date of birth, whether an older child qualifies as a student or disabled, the child's relationship to you, and how many months the child lived with you.</p>

<p>The IRS is notoriously aggressive about EITC compliance. The program has a higher audit rate than many other parts of the tax code, largely because of concerns about improper claims for nonexistent or ineligible children. This creates a strange situation where some of the poorest taxpayers face the highest audit rates.</p>

<p>Many EITC recipients use commercial tax preparation services, paying fees that eat into their refunds. Some use refund anticipation loans—expensive short-term borrowing against their expected EITC payment. These financial services have become a multibillion-dollar industry built around EITC season.</p>

<h2>What It All Means</h2>

<p>The Earned Income Tax Credit represents a particular philosophy about poverty and work. It says that we want to help low-income Americans, but only those who work. It rewards employment rather than subsidizing unemployment. It allows working families to keep more of what they earn—or rather, to receive more than they earn, through the mechanism of a refundable credit.</p>

<p>Most poverty measures don't account for the EITC, which means official poverty statistics understate how much America actually does for its working poor. When researchers do include the EITC, they find it lifts millions of families above the poverty line each year.</p>

<p>The program isn't perfect. The investment income cliff is poorly designed. The marriage penalties persist. The compliance burden falls heavily on people least equipped to handle complex paperwork. The phase-out can interact badly with other programs.</p>

<p>But something unusual happened with the EITC. An idea that began in Nixon's White House, died in the Senate, reemerged under Ford, and expanded under presidents of both parties has become essentially immune to political attack. When economists are asked whether to expand it, ninety percent say yes. That's as close to consensus as economic policy ever gets.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's because the EITC embodies a compromise that most Americans can accept: help for those who need it, but only for those who work for it. It's not quite a guaranteed minimum income. It's not quite traditional welfare. It's something in between—a government payment that looks like a tax refund, a safety net that requires a ladder.</p>
