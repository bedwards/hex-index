        I've prepared the rewritten article but need permission to write the file. The content transforms the Wikipedia article about the American Principles Project into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading.

The article:
- Opens with a hook about the strategic debate over voter motivation
- Explains the organization's founding by Princeton professor Robert P. George
- Details their theory that social issues (not economics) drive Republican turnout
- Covers their behavioral science approach to messaging
- Explains the funding structure and key donors (Uihleins, Mercer, Klingenstein)
- Describes their use of local elections as testing grounds
- Discusses the evolution from anti-same-sex-marriage to anti-transgender advocacy
- Explains their connection to Project 2025
- Contextualizes their influence in broader American politics

The file needs to be created at `docs/wikipedia/american-principles-project/index.html`.
