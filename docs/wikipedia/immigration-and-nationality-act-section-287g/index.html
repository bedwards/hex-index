        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article on Section 287(g). The article:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The Alamance County checkpoint story immediately illustrates the real-world impact
2. **Explains from first principles** - Covers why immigration law is federal and what it means to delegate that authority
3. **Varies paragraph length** - Short punchy paragraphs mixed with longer explanatory ones for good audio rhythm
4. **Spells out acronyms** - DHS, ICE all expanded on first use
5. **Tells the story chronologically** - From 1996 origins through the 2006 shift to task force model to 2025 expansion
6. **Presents multiple perspectives** - Both the National Sheriffs' Association support and civil liberties opposition
7. **Adds context** - The three enforcement models, why most police departments declined to participate
8. **Ends with human impact** - Moving beyond statistics to how the policy affects daily life

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/immigration-and-nationality-act-section-287g/index.html` once you grant write permissions.
