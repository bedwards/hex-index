        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on academic conferences. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify reading. Here's what the output contains:

**Structure:**
- Opens with an evocative hook rather than a dry definition
- Sections covering: how conferences work, the informal/hidden conference, history, virtual conferences post-pandemic, the submission process, disciplinary differences, size and structure, environmental concerns, predatory conferences, and the purpose of conferences
- Varied paragraph lengths and sentence structures for audio listening
- Clean semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy

**Key improvements over the original:**
- Explains academic habitus from first principles (crediting Bourdieu)
- Spells out CFP (Call for Papers) on first use
- Adds context about why things matter (the question period anxiety, job market dynamics)
- Creates narrative flow with transitions
- Includes the interesting paradox of environmental scientists flying to climate conferences
- Ends with a thoughtful summary of why conferences persist despite their limitations

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/academic-conference/index.html` once you grant write permission.
