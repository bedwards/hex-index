<h2>The Therapists Who Created Memories That Never Happened</h2>

<p>Gary Ramona's life fell apart because of memories his daughter never actually had.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, his daughter Holly entered therapy for bulimia. Under hypnosis and the influence of sodium amytal—a barbiturate sometimes called "truth serum"—she recovered memories of her father sexually abusing her as a child. Her mother divorced Gary. He lost his job. His reputation was destroyed.</p>

<p>There was just one problem: the abuse never happened.</p>

<p>In 1994, Gary Ramona sued his daughter's therapist and won half a million dollars. It was the first case to put recovered-memory therapy itself on trial. But by then, the damage had been done—not just to the Ramona family, but to thousands of families across America, Australia, the Netherlands, and beyond who had been torn apart by memories that emerged from therapy sessions rather than from actual events.</p>

<h2>What Recovered-Memory Therapy Actually Claims</h2>

<p>The premise sounds almost reasonable at first. Recovered-memory therapy, often abbreviated as RMT, rests on a seductive idea: that traumatic experiences can be so overwhelming that the mind buries them completely, hiding them from conscious awareness while they continue to poison your life from the shadows. The therapist's job, according to this framework, is to dig up these buried memories so they can be processed and healed.</p>

<p>It's a compelling narrative. It explains why you might feel damaged without knowing why. It offers hope that understanding your hidden past will set you free.</p>

<p>The problem? It's not supported by scientific evidence.</p>

<p>Memory doesn't work like a filing cabinet where traumatic files get locked away in a drawer you can't access. It's more like a reconstruction project—every time you remember something, you're rebuilding it from fragments, influenced by your current beliefs, suggestions from others, and the context in which you're remembering. This makes memory remarkably malleable, especially under the influence of hypnosis, guided imagery, or leading questions from authority figures like therapists.</p>

<h2>The Techniques That Create False Memories</h2>

<p>The toolkit of recovered-memory therapy reads like a recipe for fabricating memories. Hypnosis. Age regression, where patients are guided to mentally return to childhood. Guided visualization, where they're asked to imagine scenes from their past. Sodium amytal interviews, using sedatives to lower psychological defenses. Journaling prompts that ask patients to write about abuse they might have experienced. Even something called "past life regression," which should immediately raise red flags about the scientific rigor of the enterprise.</p>

<p>What these techniques share is their power to suggestion. Under hypnosis, people become highly susceptible to ideas planted by the hypnotist. When a therapist says "let's explore whether you might have been abused," the patient's mind goes searching for evidence—and when the mind searches hard enough, it can construct evidence that feels absolutely real.</p>

<p>This isn't theoretical speculation. Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus conducted experiments demonstrating exactly how this works. In one famous study, researchers convinced adult subjects that they had been lost in a shopping mall at age six—an event that never happened. The technique, awkwardly named the "familial informant false narrative procedure," worked by having the experimenter claim that a family member had confirmed the false event. Subjects didn't just accept the suggestion intellectually. They developed detailed memories of the experience, complete with emotional responses and sensory details.</p>

<p>If researchers can implant memories of being lost in a mall, imagine what happens when a trusted therapist spends months exploring whether you might have been sexually abused.</p>

<h2>The Scale of the Damage</h2>

<p>A 2018 survey of over two thousand Americans aged fifty and older found that eight percent had seen therapists who discussed the possibility of repressed abuse memories—most of them in the 1990s, when recovered-memory therapy was at its peak. Four percent reported recovering memories of abuse they had no previous awareness of.</p>

<p>That four percent represents real people whose lives were reshaped by what may have been therapeutic malpractice. Some accused parents, siblings, or other family members of horrific crimes. Relationships were severed. Criminal charges were filed. Lives were destroyed—both the lives of the accusers, who genuinely believed they were victims, and the lives of the accused, who were often innocent.</p>

<p>A Washington State government report on recovered-memory therapy cases found something striking: not only did the therapy provide no positive benefits in the cases analyzed, but "the ability of repressed memory patients to function in the activities of daily living is significantly and possibly irrevocably impaired as a direct result of the controversial therapy modalities." People entered therapy with problems and emerged with fabricated traumatic histories that made them worse.</p>

<h2>The Retractors</h2>

<p>Some patients eventually realized what had happened to them.</p>

<p>These individuals, sometimes called "retractors," came to question their recovered memories after encountering critical literature about the therapy. They learned about the scientific problems with memory recovery techniques. They recognized the suggestive patterns in their own treatment. And they faced the devastating realization that they had accused innocent people of terrible things based on memories that were never real.</p>

<p>The psychological burden of being a retractor is immense. You've built your identity around being a survivor of abuse. You may have testified in court, destroyed your family, spent years in therapy processing trauma that didn't happen. Admitting the memories were false means acknowledging that your own mind betrayed you—with help from professionals you trusted.</p>

<h2>Professional Responses: Too Little, Too Late?</h2>

<p>By the mid-1990s, professional organizations began issuing warnings and guidelines, though one might argue they were closing the barn door after the horses had scattered across the countryside.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom's Royal College of Psychiatrists published the Brandon Report, advising psychiatrists to avoid recovered-memory therapy entirely, citing lack of evidence that memories recovered this way are accurate. The Canadian Psychological Association warned its members about the limitations of techniques like hypnosis, guided imagery, and age regression, and pointedly noted that "there is no constellation of symptoms which is diagnostic of child sexual abuse." The Australian Hypnotherapists Association acknowledged that while child sexual abuse is serious and damaging, certain questioning techniques can create illusory memories leading to false beliefs.</p>

<p>The Health Council of the Netherlands issued a particularly nuanced report in 2004. Yes, traumatic childhood experiences are major risk factors for psychological problems in adulthood. Yes, some traumatic memories can become temporarily inaccessible. But memories can also be confabulated—unconsciously fabricated—and even vivid, emotionally powerful memories can be completely false. The risk increases dramatically when therapists use suggestive techniques to link current symptoms to past trauma.</p>

<h2>The Legal Reckoning</h2>

<p>Courts became another battleground in the recovered-memory wars.</p>

<p>Gary Ramona's 1994 victory was a watershed, but it wasn't the end. Minnesota psychiatrist Diane Bay Humenansky faced multiple multimillion-dollar verdicts for using hypnosis and other suggestive techniques that led patients to make accusations against family members—accusations later found to be false.</p>

<p>The Netherlands took perhaps the most systematic approach. In 1999, the Dutch Board of Prosecutors General created a body with an unwieldy name: the Landelijke Expertisegroep Bijzondere Zedenzaken, or National Expert Group on Special Sexual Matters. Before prosecutors can arrest or charge someone based on recovered memories, they must consult this multidisciplinary group of experts. From 2003 to 2007, the group recommended stopping ninety percent of the cases referred to them, finding the allegations were not based on reliable evidence.</p>

<p>Ninety percent. Nearly every case that made it to the expert review was deemed unreliable.</p>

<p>In 2017, a Canadian clergyman named Brent Hawkes was acquitted of historical sexual abuse charges when the judge ruled that the complainant's method of reconstructing memories—joining a men's group, hearing similar accounts from other "survivors," and gradually building a narrative—produced evidence that "could not be reliable."</p>

<h2>The Persistence of a Discredited Idea</h2>

<p>Here's what's troubling: despite the professional condemnations, the legal defeats, and the scientific evidence against it, the core belief underlying recovered-memory therapy hasn't disappeared from popular culture.</p>

<p>The idea that a child can suffer horrific abuse, immediately bury the memory so completely that they remember nothing of what happened, grow up psychologically scarred by this hidden trauma, and then recover the memory decades later under the right therapeutic conditions—this narrative is everywhere. It appears in novels, films, television shows, and true crime podcasts. It shapes how people interpret their own psychological struggles.</p>

<p>Yet as the scientific literature bluntly states, this belief "is not supported by evidence."</p>

<p>That's not to say all recovered memories are false. Memory is complicated. People can genuinely forget things and remember them later. Trauma can affect memory in various ways. But the specific mechanism proposed by recovered-memory therapy—complete repression of traumatic memories that remain influential despite being inaccessible—lacks scientific support. And the techniques used to "recover" these memories are precisely the techniques known to create false ones.</p>

<h2>What We've Learned About Memory</h2>

<p>The recovered-memory controversy taught psychology some expensive lessons about how memory actually works.</p>

<p>Memory isn't recording; it's reconstruction. Every time you recall an event, you're reassembling it from fragments, filling in gaps with plausible details, and updating it based on what you've learned since. This is why eyewitness testimony, once considered the gold standard of evidence, is now understood to be far less reliable than we assumed.</p>

<p>Confidence doesn't equal accuracy. People can be absolutely certain about memories that are completely wrong. The emotional intensity of a memory—how real it feels—tells you nothing about whether it actually happened. False memories can be just as vivid, detailed, and emotionally powerful as real ones.</p>

<p>Authority figures can shape memory. When a therapist, hypnotist, or investigator repeatedly asks about events that may have happened, they're not neutrally exploring the past. They're actively participating in constructing it. This is why forensic interview protocols for children now emphasize non-leading questions—because leading questions don't just elicit memories, they help create them.</p>

<h2>The Question That Remains</h2>

<p>So what do we do with claims of abuse that emerge decades after the alleged events, particularly when those claims surface during therapy?</p>

<p>The answer isn't simple. Some abuse is real, and some victims do stay silent for years before disclosing. Dismissing all delayed accusations would protect abusers and silence genuine victims. But treating recovered memories as equivalent to ordinary memories—as some legal scholars still argue we should—ignores everything we've learned about how false memories form.</p>

<p>The Dutch approach offers one model: require expert review before prosecution, filtering out cases built on unreliable foundations while allowing genuinely credible cases to proceed. The Australian counseling association suggests another piece of the puzzle: therapists should never affirm accusations as true based solely on recovered memories without corroborating evidence.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important lesson is humility. Memory is not a reliable archive of the past. Therapy is not a neutral process of discovery. Good intentions—on the part of both therapists and patients—do not guarantee good outcomes. And the mind's capacity to construct compelling false realities is far greater than most people want to believe.</p>

<p>Gary Ramona eventually got his legal vindication. But his family was never restored. His daughter Holly continued to believe her memories were real. The relationship between them remained broken.</p>

<p>That's the tragedy of recovered-memory therapy in miniature: even after the techniques are discredited, even after the lawsuits are won, the memories—false though they may be—often persist. They feel real to those who hold them. And feeling real, in the end, may be the most dangerous thing about them.</p>
