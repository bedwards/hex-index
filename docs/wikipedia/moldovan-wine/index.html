<h2>The Underground Kingdom of Wine</h2>

<p>Buried beneath the rolling hills of Moldova lies a wine cellar so vast that visitors drive cars through it. The tunnels at Mileștii Mici stretch for two hundred kilometers—longer than most European subway systems—holding one and a half million bottles in perfect darkness. The Guinness Book of World Records confirms it: this is the largest wine collection on Earth.</p>

<p>Yet most wine enthusiasts couldn't point to Moldova on a map.</p>

<p>This tiny nation wedged between Romania and Ukraine has been making wine for at least five thousand years, long before Bordeaux existed, long before anyone thought to call certain regions "wine countries." The evidence is literally written in stone: grape seed imprints near the village of Vărvăreuca date back to 2800 BCE, their size proving that humans were already cultivating vines rather than just gathering wild grapes. Go back even further—six to twenty-five million years—and you find fossilized leaves of an ancient grape species called Vitis teutonica near the northern village of Naslavcea.</p>

<p>Wine, in Moldova, predates recorded history.</p>

<h2>A Country That Drinks Its Own Product</h2>

<p>The statistics tell an unusual story. Moldova has about 148,500 hectares planted with grapevines—that's roughly 367,000 acres, an area slightly larger than the entire city of Los Angeles. But here's what makes Moldova different: only 107,800 hectares go toward commercial production. The remaining 40,700 hectares? Those are small family plots scattered around villages, where households tend vines passed down through generations.</p>

<p>Think about that for a moment.</p>

<p>Nearly a third of Moldova's vineyard land exists for making home wine. Families maintain their own grape varieties, their own secret recipes, their own traditions. In a world where industrial agriculture has homogenized most food production, Moldova preserves something increasingly rare: living agricultural heritage in the hands of ordinary people.</p>

<p>The country produces around two million hectoliters of wine annually—that's two hundred million liters, enough to fill eighty Olympic swimming pools. This makes Moldova the eleventh largest wine producer in Europe, punching well above its weight given that the entire country has only about 2.6 million people. For comparison, France produces roughly 46 million hectoliters but has a population twenty-five times larger.</p>

<h2>The Rivers That Define a Wine Region</h2>

<p>Moldova's wine geography is shaped by two rivers: the Nistru (known internationally as the Dniester) to the east and the Prut to the west. Between these waterways lies what geologists call "the warm continental climate zone"—warm enough for grapes to ripen fully, cold enough to give wines the acidity that keeps them fresh and interesting.</p>

<p>Three historical wine regions carry protected geographic indication status, meaning wines from these areas can use the regional name on their labels, similar to how Champagne can only come from Champagne:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Codru</strong>, in the central zone, where forested hills moderate temperatures</li>
<li><strong>Valul lui Traian</strong>, in the southwest, named after Trajan's Wall—the ancient Roman fortification that once marked imperial boundaries</li>
<li><strong>Ștefan Vodă</strong>, in the southeast, honoring Stephen the Great, the medieval prince who transformed Moldovan winemaking</li>
</ul>

<p>The southern regions—including Cahul and the famous Purcari micro-zone—excel at red wines, particularly sweet and semi-sweet styles that might surprise drinkers accustomed to the bone-dry preferences of contemporary wine culture. The warmer climate pushes sugar levels higher, creating whites with noticeable alcohol content and reds with luxurious, almost Port-like sweetness.</p>

<h2>Greeks, Romans, and the Trade Routes of Antiquity</h2>

<p>By the third century BCE, Moldovan grape growers had established trading relationships with Greek merchants. These weren't casual exchanges. The Greeks were serious about wine, considering it essential to civilization itself—they called non-wine-drinking peoples "barbarians" partly because such people didn't participate in the symposium, the ritualized drinking party that served as Greek society's intellectual salon.</p>

<p>When Roman legions arrived in 107 CE under Emperor Trajan (the same emperor whose wall gives one wine region its name), they brought more systematic viticulture. Romans planted vines wherever they conquered, both for practical reasons—wine was safer to drink than water—and cultural ones. Wine was civilization. Wine was Rome.</p>

<p>The archaeological evidence suggests that Roman occupation intensified grape growing significantly. Amphorae—the clay vessels Romans used for shipping wine—appear throughout Moldovan dig sites from this period. The locals learned Roman techniques, and the techniques stuck.</p>

<h2>The Golden Age of Stephen the Great</h2>

<p>Fast forward to the fifteenth century. Moldova has become a feudal principality, and on the throne sits Stephen the Great, known in Romanian as Ștefan cel Mare. He would reign for forty-seven years, from 1457 to 1504, and become the most celebrated figure in Moldovan history.</p>

<p>Stephen did something unusual for a medieval ruler: he treated wine as a strategic industry.</p>

<p>He imported high-quality grape varieties from abroad, understanding that better raw materials meant better products. He promoted winemaking improvements throughout his realm. And he exported aggressively, sending Moldovan wines to Poland, Ukraine, and Russia, where they became luxury goods in royal courts.</p>

<p>Wine wasn't just an agricultural product to Stephen. It was soft power. It was revenue. It was national identity.</p>

<p>The wines developed during his reign established reputations that would persist for centuries. Moldova became known as a serious wine country, not a curiosity but a producer of genuinely distinguished bottles.</p>

<h2>Under the Russian Empire</h2>

<p>The Treaty of Bucharest in 1812 ended a six-year war between the Russian and Ottoman Empires. Among its terms: the Ottoman Empire ceded the eastern part of the Principality of Moldova to Russia. This region became known as Bessarabia, and it would remain under Russian control, with brief interruptions, until 1991.</p>

<p>Russian rule proved surprisingly good for Moldovan wine, at least initially.</p>

<p>The imperial government actively supported grape growers. By 1837—just twenty-five years after annexation—Bessarabia's vineyard area had reached 14,000 hectares, producing twelve million liters annually. The main varieties remained traditional Moldovan grapes with evocative names: Rară neagră (meaning "black rare"), Fetească albă ("white maiden's grape"), Tămâioasă (named for its incense-like aroma), Galbenă ("yellow"), and the wonderfully named Batuta neagră ("beaten black").</p>

<p>But producers also experimented with Hungarian, Bulgarian, Greek, and Turkish varieties. Moldova became a viticultural laboratory, testing what might thrive in its particular combination of soil and climate.</p>

<h2>The French Invasion</h2>

<p>The second half of the nineteenth century brought profound change to Moldovan vineyards—not through war, but through fashion.</p>

<p>French wines had become the gold standard worldwide. Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne: these names carried prestige that other regions couldn't match. Winemakers everywhere began planting French varieties, hoping to capture some of that magic.</p>

<p>Moldova was no exception.</p>

<p>Pinot blanc, Pinot noir, Pinot gris arrived. So did Aligoté, the traditional grape of Burgundy's everyday white wines. Cabernet Sauvignon came from Bordeaux, along with Sauvignon blanc. Gamay traveled from Beaujolais. Muscat blanc, Traminer, and others followed.</p>

<p>This era produced Moldova's most famous wines. Negru de Purcari—meaning "Black of Purcari"—became legendary: a blend built around the indigenous Rară neagră grape with French varieties added for structure. Romănești wines gained similar renown. These weren't imitations of French originals. They were something new: Moldovan expressions using an international vocabulary.</p>

<p>By 1914, Bessarabia possessed the largest vineyard area anywhere in the Russian Empire.</p>

<h2>The Bug That Ate Europe</h2>

<p>Then came phylloxera.</p>

<p>This tiny aphid, native to North America, had hitchhiked to Europe on botanical specimens in the 1860s. American grapevines had evolved resistance to it; European vines had not. The bug attacked roots, killing plants within a few years. By century's end, phylloxera had destroyed roughly two-thirds of Europe's vineyards.</p>

<p>Moldova suffered like everywhere else.</p>

<p>The solution—grafting European vines onto resistant American rootstocks—took years to implement. It wasn't until 1906 that Moldovan vineyards began serious recovery. The process required uprooting dead vines, obtaining American rootstocks, grafting the desired European varieties onto them, and then waiting several more years for the new plants to mature.</p>

<p>Just as recovery reached completion, World War One arrived.</p>

<h2>The Twentieth Century Roller Coaster</h2>

<p>Both World Wars devastated Moldovan vineyards. The region changed hands multiple times: Russian Empire, Romanian Kingdom, Soviet Union, back to Romania during World War Two, Soviet Union again. Each transition brought disruption. Each disruption meant neglected vines, destroyed facilities, lost expertise.</p>

<p>The serious rebuilding began in the 1950s under Soviet rule.</p>

<p>Moscow wanted wine, lots of it, and Moldova was positioned to provide. Over just ten years, more than 150,000 hectares were planted. By 1960, total vineyard area reached 220,000 hectares—even larger than the pre-phylloxera peak.</p>

<p>Soviet planners didn't much care about quality. They wanted quantity. Moldovan wine flowed eastward to quench Russia's thirst, and Russian consumers weren't demanding Burgundy-level sophistication. Sweet, strong, plentiful: these were the requirements.</p>

<p>Then came one of history's strangest agricultural policies.</p>

<p>Mikhail Gorbachev's anti-alcohol campaign, launched in 1985, aimed to combat the Soviet Union's genuine alcoholism crisis. Part of the solution, Soviet planners decided, was destroying the means of production. Between 1985 and 1987, roughly thirty percent of Moldova's vineyards were ripped out.</p>

<p>Decades of planting, grafting, cultivation—gone in two years.</p>

<h2>Independence and the Russian Ban</h2>

<p>Moldova declared independence in 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed. The young nation inherited a damaged but still substantial wine industry, and more importantly, it inherited Russia as its primary customer. By the mid-2000s, fully eighty percent of Moldovan wine exports went to Russia.</p>

<p>This was not a healthy situation.</p>

<p>In 2006, a diplomatic dispute led Russia to ban all Moldovan and Georgian wines, ostensibly over health concerns but transparently political in motivation. Moldova had annoyed Moscow; Moscow struck at Moldova's economy.</p>

<p>The ban lasted two years and caused genuine hardship. Wineries that had built their entire business around Russian exports suddenly had no customers. Many struggled or failed.</p>

<p>But the crisis forced evolution.</p>

<p>Moldovan producers began seeking new markets in Western Europe, North America, Asia. They improved quality because they had to—Western consumers wouldn't accept the sweet, oxidized wines that Russian markets had happily absorbed. The industry modernized.</p>

<p>In 2013, as Moldova announced plans to sign an association treaty with the European Union, Russia imposed another ban. This time, the impact was muted. Moldova had diversified. The nation had learned not to put all its wine in one market's basket.</p>

<h2>The Modern Industry</h2>

<p>Today, Moldova exports wine to 75 countries from 260 different wineries. Sixty percent of production goes to European Union member states—a complete reversal from the Russian-dominated years.</p>

<p>The National Office of Vine and Wine, created in 2013, established the "Wine of Moldova" brand for international marketing. The Moldova Wine Guild, a non-profit formed in 2007 by leading private wineries, coordinates promotion and education efforts.</p>

<p>The quality focus has yielded results. Contemporary Moldovan wines regularly win medals at international competitions. Critics who once ignored the country now visit for research. The wines finding export markets aren't industrial Soviet-era plonk—they're serious bottles from producers like Purcari, Château Vartely, and Cricova.</p>

<h2>The Grapes: Old and New</h2>

<p>Moldova's vineyards now host a fascinating mix of indigenous varieties and international imports.</p>

<p>Among the indigenous grapes, Fetească albă (white maiden's grape) and Fetească neagră (black maiden's grape) have gained the most international attention. The white version produces aromatic wines with floral notes; the black makes structured reds capable of aging. Fetească regală (royal maiden's grape) is actually a natural cross between Fetească albă and Furmint, the famous grape of Hungarian Tokaji.</p>

<p>Rară neagră remains the soul of Moldova's most historic wine, Negru de Purcari. This variety was already famous in the eighteenth century, before Cabernet Sauvignon arrived from France. Only about 170 hectares remain planted, mostly in the Purcari region where it has always thrived.</p>

<p>Plavaie and Busuioacă albă (white basil grape, named for its herbal aroma) survive but barely—rare varieties that deserve preservation.</p>

<p>The French varieties that arrived in the nineteenth century have become firmly established: Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Pinot gris, Pinot blanc, Riesling, Aligoté. For reds, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot dominate, with Pinot noir and Malbec also well represented.</p>

<p>More recent additions are still on trial: Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Carignan from France; Montepulciano from Italy; Tempranillo from Spain. Moldova continues its centuries-long experiment, testing what the land can support.</p>

<h2>Divin: The Other Spirit</h2>

<p>Not all Moldovan grapes become wine. Some become divin—Moldova's brandy, produced using the same methods as French cognac. The name "cognac" itself is protected; only brandy from the Cognac region of France can legally use it. So Moldova calls its equivalent "divin," from the Latin for "divine."</p>

<p>The process is the same: wine is double-distilled in copper pot stills, then aged in oak barrels for years or decades. The results can be genuinely impressive, though divin remains far less known internationally than the country's wines.</p>

<h2>The Underground Cities</h2>

<p>Moldova's most distinctive wine infrastructure lies underground.</p>

<p>Mileștii Mici, the Guinness-certified largest wine collection, occupies former limestone mines that stretch for two hundred kilometers beneath the Moldovan countryside. The tunnels maintain perfect cellar conditions naturally: twelve to fourteen degrees Celsius year-round, eighty-five to ninety-five percent humidity. Visitors drive through on actual roads, passing millions of bottles aging in carved stone chambers.</p>

<p>Cricova, another former mine converted to wine storage, stretches 120 kilometers. Its cellars have hosted state dinners and stored collections belonging to figures including Vladimir Putin and Angela Merkel. The scale defies imagination—entire neighborhoods could fit inside.</p>

<p>These underground labyrinths represent Soviet-era industrial ambition repurposed for something more interesting. What were once quarries extracting building materials became vast temperature-controlled warehouses perfect for wine storage. The transformation happened because someone looked at empty tunnels and saw possibility.</p>

<h2>The Resilience of a Wine Culture</h2>

<p>What strikes me most about Moldova's wine story is its sheer persistence.</p>

<p>This small territory has been conquered repeatedly: by Greeks, Romans, Ottomans, Russians, Soviets. Each wave brought disruption. Wars destroyed vineyards. Political decisions ripped them out. Insects devoured them. Trade bans made production economically senseless.</p>

<p>Yet wine survived.</p>

<p>It survived because it was never just about commerce. Those 40,700 hectares of family vineyards—nearly a third of the total—represent something deeper than an industry. They represent culture. Identity. Family recipes passed down through generations. The knowledge of which grape variety your grandmother planted and why.</p>

<p>Today Moldova exports to 75 countries. It has modernized, professionalized, marketed itself effectively. These are genuine achievements.</p>

<p>But the more remarkable achievement is the continuity: five thousand years of winemaking in a land that has seen every imaginable disruption, and the vines still grow. The families still make their wine. The tunnels still stretch for hundreds of kilometers beneath the hills.</p>

<p>Some traditions, it turns out, are harder to destroy than empires.</p>
