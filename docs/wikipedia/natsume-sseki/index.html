        The essay has been written and is ready. Here's the rewritten Wikipedia article on Natsume Sōseki, transformed from encyclopedic content into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki">Wikipedia: Natsume Sōseki</a></p>

<p>In 1900, a thirty-three-year-old Japanese scholar sailed from Yokohama to London on a government mission to master English literature. He returned two years later having suffered a complete nervous breakdown, convinced his landladies thought him insane, haunted by loneliness and racial alienation in a city that made him feel like "a stray dog mixing with a pack of wolves." From this wreckage, Natsume Sōseki would become the greatest novelist in modern Japanese history—his portrait gracing the thousand-yen banknote for two decades, his books still devoured by millions more than a century after his death.</p>

<p>The connection between breakdown and breakthrough wasn't incidental. Sōseki himself acknowledged his "indebtedness" to the "nervous breakdown and insanity" that drove him to write. His suffering became raw material for fiction that explored what it means to be human in a world rushing toward modernity, leaving traditional certainties in ruins.</p>

<h2>A Child Nobody Wanted</h2>

<p>Sōseki was born Natsume Kinnosuke on February 9, 1867, in Edo—the city we now call Tokyo—the youngest of eight children. The timing could hardly have been worse.</p>

<p>His father held the hereditary position of nanushi, a neighborhood magistrate. This was prestigious, well-paid work. But Sōseki arrived on the eve of the Meiji Restoration, the revolutionary upheaval that would abolish the feudal order and, with it, his father's livelihood. The family's fortunes collapsed just as an unwanted eighth child appeared.</p>

<p>His parents—fifty-one and forty-one years old—were ashamed to have produced a baby so late in life. They considered him a burden. Shortly after his birth, they gave him away.</p>

<p>His first foster parents were a couple who bought and sold secondhand goods. Sōseki later wrote that they would leave him unattended in a basket at nighttime bazaars while they worked. One of his sisters found him there and brought him home. He was soon given away again.</p>

<p>At four years old, he was adopted by a childless couple, the Shiobaras, who raised him to believe they were his biological parents. At six, he contracted smallpox, which left permanent scars across his nose and cheeks—a disfigurement that fed a lifelong sense of self-contempt.</p>

<p>The deception ended when he was nine. His foster father took a mistress, domestic war erupted, and the household fell apart. Sōseki's biological father reclaimed him after learning Shiobara planned to put the boy to work in a restaurant. Back in the Natsume household, young Kinnosuke was told his real parents were his grandparents.</p>

<p>He learned the truth one night when a maid whispered it to him as he lay in bed.</p>

<p>What stayed with him wasn't the betrayal. It was the kindness of the maid who told him.</p>

<p>For years afterward, his biological father and adoptive father fought over him like a piece of property. Both men likely saw the intelligent boy as an investment in their own futures. Shiobara had legally registered Sōseki as his heir, complicating any clean break. The legal battle wasn't resolved until Sōseki was twenty-one, when his biological father paid Shiobara 240 yen—compensation for "seven years of care and education"—and Kinnosuke was officially re-registered as Naokatsu's fourth son.</p>

<p>The scars from these years never healed. The misanthropy and alienation that pervade Sōseki's writing have their roots in a childhood where he was unwanted, deceived, and treated as a commodity.</p>

<h2>An Accidental Scholar</h2>

<p>Sōseki's path to becoming Japan's first English literary scholar was anything but direct. As a young man, his ambitions shifted constantly. He showed early brilliance in school, then dropped out without telling his parents to study classical Chinese literature at a traditional academy. This was a contrarian choice in an era obsessed with Western modernization, but it gave him a deep command of classical Chinese that would later enrich his prose.</p>

<p>Eventually he recognized that English was essential for advancement in Meiji Japan. He enrolled in an English cram school, passed the entrance exams for the elite First Special Higher School—where classes were conducted almost entirely in English—and graduated at the head of his class. In 1890, he entered Tokyo Imperial University to study English literature.</p>

<p>He was miserable there.</p>

<p>He had briefly considered studying architecture but was talked out of it by a friend who argued that no Japanese architect could ever create something as ambitious as St. Paul's Cathedral. So instead he studied a literature that felt equally foreign, equally impossible to master from the inside. He later described his university years as "agony"—struggling to understand English literature from a Japanese perspective, feeling like a fraud.</p>

<p>After graduating in 1893, he took teaching posts in Tokyo but couldn't shake the feeling of an "insuperable gap between his life and his profession." In the winter of 1894–95, he spent two weeks at a Zen temple in Kamakura, seeking clarity. It didn't come.</p>

<p>In 1895, frustrated and heartbroken (his future wife Kyōko later mentioned romantic turmoil), he resigned abruptly and moved to Matsuyama, a provincial town on the island of Shikoku. He described the move as going there to "bury himself alive."</p>

<p>It turned out to be research.</p>

<h2>London and Madness</h2>

<p>By 1900, Sōseki had married Nakane Kyōko—an arranged match with the daughter of a high-ranking government official—and was teaching at a prestigious school in Kumamoto. Their marriage was turbulent from the start. Kyōko, raised wealthy, was unprepared for domestic work. Sōseki was demanding and often cruel. These patterns would persist until his death.</p>

<p>Then the government intervened. The Ministry of Education ordered Sōseki to England for two years as Japan's first English literary scholar. He didn't want to go—worried about his young family, anxious about living abroad—but as a government employee, he had no choice.</p>

<p>What followed were the worst two years of his life.</p>

<p>London swallowed him. He lived in a series of grim boarding houses on a stipend so meager he worried constantly about money. He found English society cold and unwelcoming. As a Japanese man in Edwardian Britain, he felt perpetually othered, perpetually diminished. "A stray dog mixing with a pack of wolves" was how he put it.</p>

<p>He briefly attended lectures at University College London but found them disappointing. He hired a private tutor—a Shakespearean scholar named William James Craig—but found the instruction disorganized. Mostly, he retreated to his room and read. He accumulated a library of four hundred volumes and turned inward.</p>

<p>This isolation sparked an intellectual crisis. Sōseki began to doubt the very foundations of literature as he'd been taught to understand it. Why should Western definitions of literature apply to him? Why should he accept concepts imposed from outside his own experience? He launched what he called a "ten-year plan"—an attempt to define literature from first principles using psychology, sociology, and scientific method. He would understand it "on my own terms."</p>

<p>The pressure crushed him.</p>

<p>Poverty, loneliness, intellectual strain, and mounting paranoia combined into a full nervous breakdown. He became reclusive. His landladies reported to the Japanese government that he had gone mad. The Ministry of Education received a telegram: "Natsume has gone mad." They ordered him home.</p>

<p>While in London, he also received news that his closest friend, the poet Masaoka Shiki, had died. This may have pushed him over the edge.</p>

<p>"The two years I spent in London was the most miserable time of my life," he wrote later. It was also the crucible in which his literary genius was forged.</p>

<h2>The Birth of a Novelist</h2>

<p>Sōseki returned to Japan in January 1903 in worse mental condition than when he'd left. He suffered severe paranoid delusions, accusing his family of plotting against him, erupting in rage over trivial noises. His pregnant wife Kyōko was forced to take the children and leave for two months.</p>

<p>Despite all this, he secured the most prestigious teaching position in the country: lecturer in English literature at Tokyo Imperial University, succeeding the beloved Lafcadio Hearn. Students initially resented him. Hearn had been literary and impressionistic; Sōseki was rigorous and analytical. But his Shakespeare lectures, begun in late 1903, packed the hall to standing room only.</p>

<p>In late 1904, something broke open.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of a poet friend, Sōseki began writing what he thought would be a short piece—a story narrated by a housecat observing his pompous master and the master's equally absurd friends. The first chapter of <em>I Am a Cat</em> appeared in a literary journal in 1905. Readers loved it. They demanded more. What started as a sketch expanded into a full satirical novel serialized through 1906.</p>

<p>The book was unlike anything in Japanese literature at the time. Its wit, its satirical edge, its blend of Western and East Asian allusions—all of it distinguished Sōseki from the prevailing naturalist fiction of the era. Here was something genuinely new.</p>

<p>Sōseki later connected this creative explosion directly to his breakdown. The madness had unlocked something. The suffering had become fuel.</p>

<p>Between 1905 and 1907, while still teaching full-time, he published at a furious pace: novellas, short stories, and most notably <em>Botchan</em> (1906), a comic novel drawing on his time in Matsuyama that became one of his most beloved works. He also produced <em>Kusamakura</em> (often translated as <em>Grass for a Pillow</em>), an experimental, lyrical work about an artist trying to transcend human emotion. Sōseki called it a "haiku-esque novel" and hoped it would offer readers solace from the pains of life.</p>

<h2>The Professional Artist</h2>

<p>By 1907, Sōseki was a literary celebrity. Then the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's major national newspapers, made him an extraordinary offer: an annual salary to write novels exclusively for serialization in their pages. No teaching. No government obligations. Just writing.</p>

<p>He accepted immediately.</p>

<p>This decision was more revolutionary than it sounds. In Meiji Japan, respectable intellectuals worked for the state or academia. The idea of being a professional novelist—a "non-aligned artist" shaping his own destiny outside the bureaucracy—was radical. Sōseki's choice marked the birth of a new kind of cultural figure in modern Japan.</p>

<p>At his Tokyo home, he hosted a weekly gathering called the Thursday Salon, which ran from 1906 until his death. Writers and scholars gathered around him. He became not just an author but a movement, his disciples spreading his influence through Japanese letters.</p>

<p>His first novel for the Asahi, <em>The Poppy</em> (1907), was a stylized melodrama that readers adored but Sōseki later dismissed as "badly made." He followed it with a trilogy that marked his turn toward deeper psychological territory: <em>Sanshirō</em> (1908), <em>And Then</em> (1909), and <em>The Gate</em> (1910). These novels explored love, betrayal, and the assertion of self with increasing darkness and complexity.</p>

<p>Then his body nearly killed him.</p>

<h2>The Shuzenji Catastrophe</h2>

<p>In August 1910, while working on <em>The Gate</em> at Shuzenji Hot Springs, Sōseki suffered a massive hemorrhage from chronic stomach ulcers. He vomited a basin full of blood. He lost consciousness for thirty minutes. For several days, he hovered between life and death.</p>

<p>The event became national news. The Asahi Shimbun—his employer—published daily updates on his condition. All of Japan held its breath.</p>

<p>He survived. Barely.</p>

<p>The near-death experience changed him. He later wrote that it gave him an "unconditional gratitude for life itself." But his health remained fragile for the rest of his days. He was forty-three years old and living on borrowed time.</p>

<h2>The Dark Masterpieces</h2>

<p>Sōseki's late works grew increasingly bleak. The psychological explorations that had characterized his middle period deepened into meditations on human egoism, the impossibility of genuine connection, and the loneliness at the core of existence.</p>

<p><em>The Wayfarer</em> (1912) portrays a paranoid scholar descending into madness—territory Sōseki knew firsthand. Then came <em>Kokoro</em> (1914), often considered his masterpiece. The title is usually left untranslated because no English word captures it: "heart," "mind," "spirit," "the emotional core of a person." The novel follows a young man's relationship with an enigmatic older figure called "Sensei" (Teacher), building toward a devastating confession that reveals the cost of betrayal and the isolation of guilt.</p>

<p><em>Kokoro</em> remains one of the most widely read novels in Japan, a staple of high school curricula, a book that has shaped how generations of Japanese readers understand the psychological costs of modernity.</p>

<p>Sōseki's final completed novel was <em>Grass on the Wayside</em> (1915), a thinly veiled autobiography dealing with his troubled marriage and difficult family relationships. It was painful to write and painful to read—honesty without comfort.</p>

<h2>The Unfinished End</h2>

<p>In 1916, Sōseki began serializing <em>Light and Dark</em>, an ambitious novel following two married couples through intricate social and psychological maneuvering. It was shaping up to be his longest and most complex work.</p>

<p>He never finished it.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1916, complications from his stomach ulcers finally killed him. He was forty-nine years old. <em>Light and Dark</em> stopped mid-sentence, 188 chapters in, leaving readers forever wondering how he meant to resolve the tangled lives he'd created.</p>

<p>His death was mourned nationally. But his influence was just beginning.</p>

<h2>The Weight of a Life</h2>

<p>Natsume Sōseki published a novel every year for the last decade of his life while also writing poetry, literary criticism, and maintaining his Thursday Salon. He did this while suffering from recurring stomach hemorrhages, bouts of severe mental illness including paranoid delusions, and a marriage marked by frequent conflict.</p>

<p>His work wrestles with questions that the Meiji era forced upon Japan but that remain universal: How do we maintain our sense of self when the world transforms around us? How do we connect with others when we can barely understand ourselves? What do we owe tradition, and what do we owe the future?</p>

<p>He is often called the first modern novelist of Japan, though such titles are always contested. What's certain is that he created something unprecedented: fiction that blended Eastern and Western traditions, humor and darkness, social satire and psychological depth, in a voice entirely his own.</p>

<p>His portrait appeared on Japan's thousand-yen banknote from 1984 to 2004—the kind of honor usually reserved for political figures and emperors. That a novelist received it says something about what Sōseki means to Japan.</p>

<p>The unwanted child, given away twice, scarred by smallpox and parental rejection, became one of his nation's most beloved figures. The scholar who broke down in London, who felt like a stray dog among wolves, who doubted everything he'd been taught about literature—that broken man built a new literature from the wreckage of his certainties.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's the lesson. Perhaps breakdown really can become breakthrough, suffering can become fuel, and the people nobody wants can become the voices everybody needs.</p>

<p>Or perhaps Sōseki would find such easy morals suspicious. His books don't offer comfort. They offer honesty, which is harder and more lasting.</p>
