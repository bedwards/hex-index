<p>In 2013, a political analyst named Sean Trende made a remarkable discovery. He examined every United States presidential election from 1880 through 2012 and found something startling: the pattern of wins and losses matched almost perfectly with what you would expect from flipping a fair coin. The correlation was 0.96, essentially indistinguishable from pure chance.</p>

<p>This finding cuts against one of the most influential ideas in American political science: that elections follow predictable cycles, that certain contests fundamentally reshape politics for a generation, and that if you understand these patterns, you can predict the future.</p>

<p>The idea is called realignment theory, and for decades it dominated how scholars and journalists understood American politics. Some still swear by it. Others now dismiss it as seeing shapes in clouds.</p>

<h2>The Theory of Earthquakes</h2>

<p>Political realignment, in its simplest form, describes a fundamental shift in who votes for which party and why. Think of it as a political earthquake that reshapes the landscape. The old coalitions crumble. New ones form. Issues that once defined politics fade away, replaced by entirely different concerns. The change lasts for decades.</p>

<p>The scholar V. O. Key Jr. first articulated this idea in 1955, introducing the concept of "critical elections" that mark these dramatic shifts. Other political scientists built on his work. Walter Dean Burnham argued that these realignments occur in regular cycles, roughly every 30 to 38 years. E. E. Schattschneider and James L. Sundquist refined the theory further.</p>

<p>The appeal was obvious. If politics followed predictable patterns, you could understand the past and anticipate the future. Scholars identified what they considered clear examples of these seismic shifts in American history.</p>

<h2>1800: The Revolution of Ideas</h2>

<p>The election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800 marked the first peaceful transfer of power between opposing parties in modern history. The Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, lost control of the government to Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans.</p>

<p>Power shifted geographically from New England to the South. Jeffersonian democracy, with its emphasis on agrarian values and limited government, became the dominant ideology. The Democratic-Republicans gained nearly 40 percent of House seats across three consecutive elections.</p>

<p>Yet even this supposedly clear-cut realignment had complications. As late as 1812, the Federalists came within a single state of winning the presidency. Some historians argue the real shift happened between 1812 and 1816, when the Federalists destroyed their own credibility by opposing the War of 1812.</p>

<h2>1828: The Age of Jackson</h2>

<p>Andrew Jackson's election created what scholars call the Second Party System. The old Democratic-Republicans fractured into two new organizations that would later become the Democratic Party and the Whig Party.</p>

<p>Jackson, a frontier military hero from Tennessee, represented a new kind of politics. He championed the common man against the elite establishment. His ally Martin Van Buren of New York built one of the first modern political machines. By 1834, Henry Clay of Kentucky had organized the opposition Whigs to challenge Jackson's vision.</p>

<p>This was Jacksonian democracy: populist, expansionist, and deeply suspicious of concentrated power, whether in banks or in federal institutions.</p>

<h2>1860: The Great Unraveling</h2>

<p>The election of Abraham Lincoln represents perhaps the most dramatic realignment in American history, though calling it merely a political shift understates what happened. This realignment led to civil war.</p>

<p>The Whig Party had collapsed after 1852. Multiple parties competed for dominance: the nativist Know Nothings, the short-lived Opposition Party, and the newly formed Republicans. The system stabilized by 1858, and Lincoln's victory in 1860 marked the Republican ascendance.</p>

<p>Lincoln faced three opponents. Remarkably, even if all three had somehow combined their votes, Lincoln still would have won the Electoral College. The Republican coalition built around opposition to slavery's expansion proved unbeatable in the North.</p>

<p>The Republican Party's rise was meteoric. They held just 18 percent of House seats in 1854. By 1860, they controlled 59 percent. The coalition they built around "free labor" ideology, nationalism, and eventually the Union Army would dominate American politics for decades. Military voters and veterans became a Republican constituency that persists to this day.</p>

<h2>1896: The Disputed Revolution</h2>

<p>Here the scholarly consensus fractures.</p>

<p>Some political scientists, like Jerome Clubb, argue the 1896 election was not a realignment at all. Others, like Walter Dean Burnham and Paul Kleppner, consider it the defining realignment that separates the Civil War era from modern American politics.</p>

<p>William McKinley's campaign against William Jennings Bryan certainly changed the rules of the game. Bryan, the Democratic nominee, invented the modern technique of focusing campaign energy on closely contested states. He traveled relentlessly, speaking directly to crowds, preaching a populist message of class conflict.</p>

<p>McKinley's campaign, masterminded by Mark Hanna, pioneered outside fundraising from business interests. He outspent Bryan ten to one, drawing on corporate money rather than the traditional practice of extracting contributions from government officeholders.</p>

<p>Bryan's populism, with its famous "Cross of Gold" speech attacking the gold standard, marked a new direction for Democrats. McKinley's victory celebrated pluralism and industrial growth. Both represented genuine departures from Civil War politics.</p>

<p>Yet the statistical evidence for 1896 as a single realigning election is weak. When scholars examine voting patterns county by county, they find no dramatic shift. The realignment, if it happened, was gradual rather than sudden.</p>

<h2>1932: The New Deal Order</h2>

<p>Franklin Roosevelt's election amid the Great Depression created what scholars call the New Deal coalition. This is the realignment that resonates most clearly with people alive today, because its effects lasted into living memory.</p>

<p>Roosevelt assembled a coalition of urban workers, labor unions, African Americans in Northern cities, Southern whites, Catholics, Jews, and intellectuals. This coalition dominated American politics for nearly 50 years, winning seven of nine presidential elections between 1932 and 1964.</p>

<p>The issues changed completely. Economic security replaced the fading concerns of the Civil War era. The federal government took on vast new responsibilities. Modern liberalism and modern conservatism as we understand them today emerged from debates about the New Deal.</p>

<h2>The Problem of Pattern-Finding</h2>

<p>Realignment theory hit a serious problem: it stopped working.</p>

<p>If realignments occur every 30 to 38 years, as Burnham argued, then one should have happened around 1968 or 1972. Richard Nixon's victories did seem to break apart the New Deal coalition. But subsequent elections failed to establish a new stable order. Jimmy Carter won in 1976. Ronald Reagan won landslides in 1980 and 1984. Bill Clinton won twice in the 1990s. George W. Bush won narrowly in 2000 and 2004. Barack Obama won decisively in 2008 and 2012. Donald Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020.</p>

<p>Where was the new stable majority? Where was the lasting coalition?</p>

<p>Some scholars responded by stretching the theory. A. James Reichley argued that true realignments occur only every 50 to 60 years, pointing to Democratic dominance from 1800 to 1860 and Republican dominance from 1860 to 1932. Others suggested realignment theory never claimed mechanical regularity and that shifts happen whenever social, economic, and political conditions align.</p>

<p>Critics grew more pointed. Political scientist David Mayhew argued in his influential critique that "elections and their underlying causes are not usefully sortable into generation-long spans." He called the theory "too slippery, too binary, too apocalyptic, and too much of a dead end."</p>

<p>Sean Trende, comparing election results to coin flips, put it memorably: "Finding a 'realigning' election is a lot like finding an image of Jesus in a grilled-cheese sandwich. If you stare long enough and hard enough, you will eventually find what you are looking for."</p>

<h2>The Emerging Democratic Majority That Wasn't</h2>

<p>The dangers of realignment thinking became vivid in 2016.</p>

<p>In 2002, journalist John Judis and political scientist Ruy Teixeira published "The Emerging Democratic Majority," arguing that demographic trends made Democratic dominance inevitable. Young voters, minorities, educated professionals, and women were all trending Democratic. Republican-leaning groups were shrinking. The math seemed inexorable.</p>

<p>This thesis shaped political commentary for years. Analysts spoke confidently of a "blue wall" of states that Democrats could not lose. In the 2016 election, most coverage assumed Hillary Clinton was heavily favored.</p>

<p>Then Donald Trump won.</p>

<p>In his post-election analysis, the statistician Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight cited Trende's work arguing that "there are few if any permanent majorities." Both analysts concluded that belief in an emerging Democratic majority had led commentators to systematically overstate Clinton's chances.</p>

<p>The lesson was stark. Demographic destiny is not destiny. Coalitions shift. Voters change their minds. New issues emerge that scramble old alignments.</p>

<h2>Realignment Versus Dealignment</h2>

<p>To understand why permanent majorities prove so elusive, it helps to distinguish between realignment and a related concept called dealignment.</p>

<p>Realignment describes voters switching from one party to another. A union worker who supported Democrats for decades begins voting Republican. A suburban professional who always voted Republican starts supporting Democrats. The voter remains engaged but shifts allegiance.</p>

<p>Dealignment is different. Voters abandon party loyalty altogether, either becoming true independents or simply withdrawing from politics. They stop caring. They stop voting. They tell pollsters they belong to no party.</p>

<p>Both phenomena destabilize existing coalitions. But realignment creates new stable coalitions, while dealignment creates volatility. Many scholars believe dealignment better describes recent American politics than realignment does.</p>

<h2>The American Exception</h2>

<p>Realignment theory developed primarily to explain American politics, and this is no accident. The United States, with its two-party system and winner-take-all elections, creates conditions where coalitions must be large and stable to win power. Voters who switch parties often stay switched for decades because so much depends on which party controls government.</p>

<p>In Britain, Canada, and other countries with parliamentary systems and multiple parties, political shifts work differently. Voters switch parties more readily, sometimes for just a single election, because they have more options and because party loyalty matters less. A disappointed Conservative voter in Britain might try the Liberal Democrats for one election before returning. That kind of movement looks less like a seismic realignment and more like ordinary democratic flexibility.</p>

<p>Australia, interestingly, resembles the United States more than Britain in this regard. Its two-party preferred system creates similar pressures toward stable coalitions and lasting realignments.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Ground to Shift</h2>

<p>Whether or not you believe in realignment cycles, certain factors clearly reshape political coalitions over time.</p>

<p>Economic crises matter enormously. The Great Depression destroyed Republican credibility and created the New Deal coalition. Economic anxieties in the 1970s helped end that coalition's dominance. The 2008 financial crisis shaped voting patterns for years afterward.</p>

<p>Racial politics have driven some of the most dramatic shifts. The Democratic Party's embrace of civil rights in the 1960s eventually pushed white Southern voters toward Republicans, transforming the electoral map. This shift took decades rather than a single election, illustrating what Key called "secular realignment," the gradual drift of voting groups rather than sudden conversion.</p>

<p>Cultural issues increasingly drive political identity. Abortion has divided Americans along partisan lines since Roe v. Wade in 1973, and the 2022 Dobbs decision overturning that precedent intensified those divisions. Rights for LGBTQ Americans, virtually absent from politics a generation ago, now correlate strongly with partisan identification. In 2022 alone, 315 bills addressing LGBTQ issues were introduced in state legislatures, with 29 becoming law.</p>

<p>Generational change matters, too, though not in the mechanical way early realignment theorists suggested. Each generation encounters politics at a different moment and carries those formative experiences forward. Voters who came of age during the Great Depression remained more Democratic throughout their lives. Those who came of age during the Reagan years skewed Republican. The political moment of youth leaves lasting marks.</p>

<h2>The Persistence of Names</h2>

<p>One curious fact about American politics: the major parties have held the same names for over 170 years. Democrats and Republicans. Yet the content of those labels has transformed utterly.</p>

<p>The Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln fought to end slavery and expand federal power. The Democratic Party of that era defended slavery and states' rights. By the mid-twentieth century, both parties contained liberal and conservative factions. By the early twenty-first century, the parties had sorted ideologically in ways that would have confused observers from any earlier era.</p>

<p>This persistence of party names while party substance changes complicates any simple story about realignment. Are the same coalitions reshuffling, or are entirely new organizations wearing old labels?</p>

<h2>Beyond the Coin Flip</h2>

<p>So what should we conclude from Trende's observation that presidential elections resemble coin flips?</p>

<p>One interpretation is that realignment theory is simply wrong, that elections are essentially random, and that any patterns scholars detect are illusions. This seems too strong. The shift from Federalist to Democratic-Republican dominance clearly happened. The Republican coalition built around the Civil War clearly existed. The New Deal coalition clearly governed for decades.</p>

<p>A more nuanced interpretation is that realignment theory became too ambitious. Scholars sought predictive power, regular cycles, and iron laws of political physics. What they found instead was history: contingent, surprising, and resistant to formulas.</p>

<p>Elections matter. Some matter more than others. Coalitions form and dissolve. Issues rise and fade. Leaders inspire and disappoint. But these patterns may be visible only in retrospect, and attempts to project them forward may be foolish.</p>

<p>The coin keeps flipping. Sometimes it lands heads. Sometimes tails. And sometimes, when enough other things change, it lands on its edge, balancing there for a moment before falling in a direction no one predicted.</p>

<h2>What This Means Now</h2>

<p>For anyone trying to understand contemporary American politics, the realignment debate offers a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>Beware grand narratives about permanent majorities. Democrats are not destined to dominate because of demographics. Republicans are not doomed by the same trends. Coalitions that seem stable can fracture. Voters who seem locked in can change their minds.</p>

<p>Pay attention to specific changes rather than sweeping cycles. Which voters are moving where, and why? What issues are emerging that might scramble current alignments? Where are the parties gaining or losing ground?</p>

<p>And maintain humility about prediction. The experts who saw an emerging Democratic majority missed what was happening in the industrial Midwest. The experts who saw a permanent Republican majority after 2004 missed Barack Obama. The experts who thought they understood 2016 missed almost everything.</p>

<p>Elections surprise us. That might be the only reliable pattern.</p>
