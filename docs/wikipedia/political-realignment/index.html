        I've rewritten the Wikipedia article on political realignment as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The rewrite:

- Opens with a hook about the 2016 election surprise rather than a dry definition
- Presents the skeptics' case early (Trende's "grilled cheese Jesus" critique, Mayhew's objections)
- Explains the theory from first principles (V.O. Key Jr.'s 1955 article, Burnham's generational cycles)
- Distinguishes realignment from dealignment
- Walks through all five American party systems with specific statistics and colorful details
- Explores cultural issues (LGBTQ rights, abortion) as contemporary drivers
- Compares American two-party dynamics to multi-party systems abroad
- Connects to current events and the related Tulsi Gabbard article
- Ends with appropriate epistemic humility about identifying realignments in real time

The essay is approximately 2,800 words (18 minutes reading time) with varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio listening.
