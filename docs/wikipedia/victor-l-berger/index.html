        I've written the essay rewriting the Victor L. Berger Wikipedia article. The piece transforms the encyclopedic content into a narrative essay optimized for Speechify, with:

- **Compelling hook**: Opens with the dramatic story of Congress refusing to seat an elected representative
- **Varied paragraph structure**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones
- **Narrative flow**: Uses transitions and storytelling rather than reference-style sections
- **Plain language**: Explains terms like "revisionist Marxism" and "sewer socialism" in accessible terms
- **Honest treatment of contradictions**: Addresses Berger's racism directly without either excusing it or reducing his whole story to it
- **Interesting connections**: Includes the "drain the swamp" etymology and connections to later policies like Social Security
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses proper tags for paragraphs, headings, blockquotes

The essay runs approximately 3,500 words, which should be around 15-20 minutes of reading time with Speechify. Would you like me to save it to a specific location, or would you prefer any adjustments to the content?
