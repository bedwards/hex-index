<h2>The Seventeen-Cent Check</h2>

<p>Ernest Ackerman, a Cleveland motorman, holds an odd distinction in American history. He retired exactly one day after Social Security began. During that single day of the program's existence, five cents were withheld from his paycheck. The government then sent him a lump-sum payout of seventeen cents.</p>

<p>This absurd transaction—a twelve-cent profit for one day's participation—captures something essential about how Social Security began: improvised, uncertain, and fundamentally experimental. No one knew if it would work. No one knew if the Supreme Court would strike it down. And no one imagined that within decades, this rickety experiment would become the most successful anti-poverty program in American history.</p>

<h2>When Half of America's Elderly Lived in Poverty</h2>

<p>It's difficult today to imagine what old age meant in 1935. More than half of all Americans over sixty-five lived in poverty. Not the poverty we debate now—whether someone can afford a second car or name-brand groceries—but genuine destitution. No savings. No pension. No options.</p>

<p>If you were lucky, your children could take you in. If you weren't, many states housed the elderly poor on what were euphemistically called "poor farms"—institutional facilities that were exactly as grim as the name suggests.</p>

<p>The Great Depression made everything worse. Banks failed. Savings evaporated. Adult children who might have supported aging parents found themselves unemployed, standing in bread lines, losing their homes. The social contract that had kept elderly Americans barely afloat—family obligation, personal savings, local charity—collapsed under the weight of economic catastrophe.</p>

<h2>Frances Perkins and the "Teeny-Weeny Bit of Socialism"</h2>

<p>The Social Security Act emerged from Franklin Roosevelt's Committee on Economic Security, led by Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve in a presidential cabinet. Perkins and her team—including political scientists from the University of Wisconsin like Edwin Witte, who would later be called "the Father of Social Security"—drafted legislation that attempted to address what they saw as the fundamental dangers of modern American life: old age without income, unemployment without savings, and families without breadwinners.</p>

<p>The proposal faced immediate opposition.</p>

<p>During a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Senator Thomas Gore of Oklahoma—a Democrat, notably—interrupted Perkins with a question that would echo through decades of American political debate: "Isn't this Socialism?"</p>

<p>Perkins replied that it was not.</p>

<p>Gore pressed on: "Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of Socialism?"</p>

<p>The exchange reveals both the political anxieties of the era and the rhetorical gymnastics required to pass major social legislation in America. Perkins and her allies had to thread an impossible needle: creating a European-style social insurance program while insisting it was nothing of the kind.</p>

<h2>The Political Genius of the Payroll Tax</h2>

<p>Roosevelt made a crucial design decision that would shape Social Security's political durability for nearly a century. Rather than funding benefits through general tax revenue, he insisted on a dedicated payroll tax. Workers would see money deducted from their paychecks specifically for Social Security, and employers would match that contribution.</p>

<p>This created what economists call a "contributory" system. You weren't receiving a government handout—you were getting back what you'd paid in. At least, that's how it felt.</p>

<p>The reality was more complicated. From the beginning, Social Security operated largely as a "pay-as-you-go" system, meaning that current workers' taxes funded current retirees' benefits. The money you put in didn't sit in an account with your name on it. It went out almost immediately to someone already retired.</p>

<p>Roosevelt understood the political implications perfectly. "We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions," he reportedly said. "With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program."</p>

<p>He was largely right. Nearly ninety years later, Social Security remains what politicians call "the third rail"—touch it and you die.</p>

<h2>The Holes in the Safety Net</h2>

<p>But Social Security's original design contained enormous gaps, and those gaps were not random.</p>

<p>The Act excluded agricultural workers. It excluded domestic servants. It excluded government employees, many teachers, nurses, hospital workers, librarians, and social workers. It excluded anyone who worked intermittently rather than continuously.</p>

<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, better known as the N.A.A.C.P., described the new law as "a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through."</p>

<p>The numbers bear this out starkly. In 1940, women made up ninety percent of domestic laborers. Two-thirds of all employed Black women worked in domestic service. Across the country, these exclusions exempted nearly half of all workers from Social Security's protections. In the South, where agriculture dominated the economy, seventy to eighty percent of African Americans in the labor force found themselves on the wrong side of the law's boundaries.</p>

<h2>Was the Exclusion Racist? A Genuine Historical Debate</h2>

<p>Historians have argued intensely about why these exclusions existed. The straightforward explanation points to Southern Democrats, who held enormous power over the congressional committees that shaped the legislation. They had obvious incentives to exclude Black workers from federal programs that might give them economic independence from white employers.</p>

<p>But other scholars, including Larry DeWitt, who spent decades researching Social Security's history, found no direct evidence of racial motivation in the committee records. The exclusions, these historians argue, reflected practical administrative concerns—the genuine difficulty of collecting payroll taxes from farmers, from households employing maids, from the patchwork of nonprofit organizations that employed nurses and social workers.</p>

<p>Moreover, other countries faced similar challenges. When Britain, France, and Germany first implemented unemployment insurance, they also excluded agricultural and domestic workers. The American policymakers consulted with European experts, including William Beveridge in Britain, and followed established international precedents.</p>

<p>Perhaps both explanations contain truth. Administrative convenience can align with racial hierarchy. A policy designed without racist intent can still produce profoundly racist outcomes. The sharecropper in Mississippi who couldn't collect benefits didn't much care whether the people who excluded him did so from animus or from bureaucratic expedience.</p>

<h2>The Court Fight Roosevelt Almost Lost</h2>

<p>Even as these debates swirled, a more fundamental threat loomed. The Supreme Court had been systematically dismantling Roosevelt's New Deal.</p>

<p>The justices struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act. They invalidated the Agricultural Adjustment Act. They threw out New York State's minimum-wage law. Most ominously for Social Security, they had already rejected the Railroad Retirement Act—legislation that looked uncomfortably similar to the old-age pension provisions Roosevelt had just signed.</p>

<p>Edwin Witte, who had drafted much of Social Security, watched these rulings with growing alarm. John Gall, a business lawyer who had testified in favor of the Act, complained that Congress had "rushed" the legislation through without properly crafting it to survive constitutional scrutiny.</p>

<p>Roosevelt responded with one of the most controversial proposals of his presidency: the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, better known as the "court-packing plan." For every Supreme Court justice over seventy who refused to retire, Roosevelt wanted the power to appoint an additional justice. The practical effect would have been to add six new justices to the Court immediately, all chosen by Roosevelt, transforming a hostile tribunal into a friendly one.</p>

<p>The proposal ignited a firestorm. Even Roosevelt's allies blanched at the blatant power grab. The debate consumed Washington for six months.</p>

<p>And then, mysteriously, the Court began changing its mind.</p>

<p>In a series of rulings starting in March 1937, the justices began upholding New Deal legislation they would have struck down months earlier. This shift—sometimes called "the switch in time that saved nine"—may have reflected genuine reconsideration of constitutional principles. Or it may have reflected justices who recognized that Roosevelt's reelection landslide in 1936 represented a democratic mandate they could not ignore. Or both.</p>

<h2>Five Votes for the General Welfare</h2>

<p>Social Security's constitutional moment came in two cases decided on the same day in May 1937.</p>

<p>In Steward Machine Company versus Davis, the Court upheld the unemployment insurance provisions by a five-to-four vote. The majority opinion acknowledged the extraordinary circumstances that had produced the law: "It is too late today for the argument to be heard with tolerance that in a crisis so extreme the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependents is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the general welfare."</p>

<p>The dissenting justices—Butler, McReynolds, and Sutherland, three of the "Four Horsemen" who had opposed nearly every New Deal measure—argued that the federal government was essentially coercing states into creating unemployment programs that met federal criteria. The Constitution, they insisted, granted no such power.</p>

<p>In Helvering versus Davis, the Court upheld the old-age pension system. The key to this ruling was almost comically technical: because Social Security taxes went into the general Treasury rather than being "earmarked" for specific benefits, they were simply taxes, and Congress had broad authority to levy taxes.</p>

<p>The logic was circular but effective. Social Security was constitutional because it was just a tax. The benefits paid out were constitutional because Congress could spend tax revenue on the general welfare. That the taxes and benefits were obviously connected didn't matter, legally speaking, because the law didn't formally connect them.</p>

<h2>Ida May Fuller's Jackpot</h2>

<p>The first monthly Social Security check went out on January 31, 1940, to Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vermont. Over three years of the program's existence, she had paid exactly $24.75 in Social Security taxes.</p>

<p>Her first check was for $22.54.</p>

<p>After her second check, she had already received more than she had ever contributed.</p>

<p>Ida May Fuller lived to be one hundred years old, dying in 1975. Over thirty-five years of retirement, she collected $22,888.92 in benefits—a return of roughly nine hundred to one on her investment.</p>

<p>This was not an accident or an anomaly. It was how the system was designed. Early beneficiaries received far more than they had paid in because Social Security was never really an individual savings program. It was a transfer system, moving money from working-age Americans to retired Americans, from one generation to the next.</p>

<p>The question that would haunt the program for decades was simple: What happens when the generations become unbalanced?</p>

<h2>The Transformation of Old Age</h2>

<p>But that question lay in the future. In Social Security's early decades, the program simply worked.</p>

<p>In 1940, total benefits paid amounted to $35 million. By 1950, that figure had grown to $961 million. By 1960, $11.2 billion. By 1980, $120 billion. By 2009, nearly fifty-one million Americans were receiving $650 billion annually.</p>

<p>The effects on American society were profound and took decades to fully manifest.</p>

<p>In 1950, roughly forty percent of Americans over sixty-five still worked in some capacity—not because they wanted to, but because they had to. By 1980, that figure had dropped below twenty percent. By 1990, fewer than eleven percent of elderly Americans remained in the workforce, an all-time low.</p>

<p>More dramatically, the entire wealth distribution of American society shifted. In the 1950s, Americans over sixty-five had the highest poverty rate of any age group, while the largest share of national wealth sat in the hands of people under thirty-five. By 2010, this had completely reversed. The wealthiest Americans were those between fifty-five and seventy-five. Those under forty-five were among the poorest.</p>

<p>Elder poverty, once as common as gray hair, had become rare.</p>

<h2>The Amendments That Changed Everything</h2>

<p>The Social Security of 1935 was not the Social Security that transformed American retirement. The program evolved through constant amendment, responding to economic conditions, political pressures, and changing ideas about what society owed its members.</p>

<p>The 1939 amendments came partly in response to the Recession of 1937, which many blamed on the government's withdrawal of spending from the economy. The $2 billion that had been collected in Social Security taxes and held in reserve represented money pulled out of circulation—deflationary in an economy that desperately needed stimulus.</p>

<p>The amendments moved the start of benefits from 1942 to 1940 and increased payments to early recipients. This reduced the reserves but got money flowing to people who would spend it. The amendments also established a formal trust fund for any surplus and made family protection—support for widows and dependent children—a core part of the program.</p>

<p>What the 1939 amendments did not address was the vast population of workers in excluded categories. That would take another decade.</p>

<p>By the 1950s, the debate had shifted. The question was no longer which occupational groups deserved coverage, but how to provide adequate protection to everyone. Social Security gradually expanded toward universal coverage, though the process was slower and more contested than its supporters wanted.</p>

<h2>Women, Families, and the Assumptions of an Era</h2>

<p>Social Security encoded the gender assumptions of its time into federal law.</p>

<p>Women generally qualified for benefits only through their relationship to men—as wives, as widows, as mothers of dependent children. The program assumed that married women didn't work for wages, that families had a single male breadwinner, and that a woman's economic security came through her husband.</p>

<p>Some reformers in the 1930s actually worried that Social Security didn't reinforce these assumptions strongly enough. They feared that insufficient benefits might "push women back into the work force"—treating female employment as a social problem to be prevented rather than a right to be supported.</p>

<p>The Aid to Dependent Children program, distributed through the states, revealed how discrimination could compound through multiple layers of government. Some local authorities simply decided that Black families needed less money than white families. Others excluded children born out of wedlock—a provision that affected Black women disproportionately. One study found that 14.4 percent of eligible white individuals received Aid to Dependent Children funding, compared to just 1.5 percent of eligible Black individuals.</p>

<h2>The Program That Couldn't Be Killed</h2>

<p>Roosevelt's prediction proved correct. Social Security became untouchable.</p>

<p>Politicians who suggested cutting benefits found themselves facing electoral annihilation. The program created its own constituency—tens of millions of current beneficiaries and hundreds of millions of future beneficiaries, all of whom had paid into the system and considered their benefits earned rather than given.</p>

<p>The contributory design that some economists criticized as inefficient turned out to be politically brilliant. Americans don't think of Social Security as welfare. They think of it as their money, coming back to them.</p>

<p>Whether this perception is accurate—whether the benefits you receive bear any relationship to the taxes you paid—matters less than the fact that people believe it. And because they believe it, Social Security has survived every attempt to fundamentally restructure or eliminate it.</p>

<h2>From Seventeen Cents to Six Hundred Fifty Billion</h2>

<p>Ernest Ackerman's seventeen-cent check and Ida May Fuller's windfall both reflected the same uncertain beginning—a program improvised in crisis, unsure of its constitutional standing, excluding half the workers who might have benefited, encoding the racial and gender hierarchies of Depression-era America into federal policy.</p>

<p>Yet this flawed, compromised, frequently unjust program accomplished something remarkable. It effectively eliminated mass poverty among the elderly in the United States. It transformed retirement from a brief, anxious period of dependency into a distinct phase of life that Americans could actually plan for and enjoy.</p>

<p>The debates about Social Security continue—about solvency, about fairness across generations, about whether the basic design still makes sense in an economy that looks nothing like 1935. But the program's core achievement stands: Americans over sixty-five are no longer the poorest members of our society. They were in 1935. They aren't anymore.</p>

<p>That seventeen-cent check was the beginning of something that changed what it means to grow old in America.</p>
