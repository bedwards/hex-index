        I've written the rewritten article. The content transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features:

1. **Strong hook** - Opens with the counterintuitive fact that the PLA belongs to a party, not a nation
2. **Varied paragraph lengths** - Mix of punchy single-sentence paragraphs and longer explanatory sections
3. **Acronyms spelled out** - PLA, CCP, CMC all introduced properly
4. **First principles explanations** - Explains why the party-army distinction matters, builds historical context step by step
5. **Narrative flow** - Chronological structure from 1927 founding through present day
6. **Clean semantic HTML** - Uses `<p>`, `<h2>` for sections, no complex markup

The article covers:
- The fundamental party-army relationship (not nation-state military)
- 1927 founding during Nanchang Uprising
- The egalitarian peasant army culture
- WWII integration and 1947 name change
- Korean War intervention
- Cultural Revolution chaos
- 1980s commercial corruption
- Tiananmen 1989
- Gulf War shock and modernization
- Current structure and spending
- Xi Jinping's reforms
- Taiwan contingency planning

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/peoples-liberation-army/index.html` - the directory will need to be created first. Would you like me to proceed once permissions are granted?
