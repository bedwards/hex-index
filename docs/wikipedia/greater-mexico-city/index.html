        I've completed rewriting the Wikipedia article about Greater Mexico City. The content is ready but I need permission to write the file to `docs/wikipedia/greater-mexico-city/index.html`.

The rewritten article:
- Opens with an engaging hook about 21 million people in a dried-up lakebed
- Explains the fascinating history of Lake Texcoco and how the Spanish drained it
- Covers the environmental challenges (trapped air, pollution) in an accessible way
- Describes the Hoy No Circula driving restriction program and its unintended consequences
- Explains conurbation and governance fragmentation in plain language
- Details the economic transformation from manufacturing to services
- Highlights the stark inequality with specific examples (wealthy Tecamachalco next to El Molinito shantytown)
- Includes the historical/cultural context (Teotihuacan, Xochimilco, volcanoes)
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths optimized for text-to-speech reading

Would you like me to proceed with writing the file once permissions are granted?
