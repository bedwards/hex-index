        I've written the essay on genetic transformation. The HTML content is ready but I need permission to write the file to create the new directory and save it. Here's a summary of the rewritten article:

**Genetic Transformation: An Essay for Text-to-Speech Reading**

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - Frederick Griffith's 1928 experiment where dead bacteria mysteriously transformed living ones
2. **Explains concepts from first principles** - What transformation is, how competence works, the difference between transformation/conjugation/transduction
3. **Tells the historical story** - The 16-year mystery, Avery's identification of DNA, the skepticism he faced
4. **Covers the molecular machinery** - How DNA crosses membranes, the role of RecA protein, differences between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
5. **Explains the evolutionary purpose** - DNA repair as the primary benefit, transformation as a stress response
6. **Describes the E. coli revolution** - How artificial competence enabled modern genetic engineering
7. **Covers modern techniques** - Chemical transformation, electroporation, the gene gun
8. **Makes fascinating connections** - Transformation as possible ancestor of sexual reproduction

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for good audio listening, spells out technical terms, and maintains a narrative flow rather than reference-document style.

Would you like me to proceed with saving the file once I have write permissions?
