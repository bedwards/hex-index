        I've written a rewrite of the Wikipedia article about Karl Ove Knausgård's "My Struggle" series. The essay transforms the encyclopedic source material into a narrative-driven piece that:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the unprecedented sales figures in Norway
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good text-to-speech flow
- Explains the literary context (comparing to Proust and the autofiction tradition)
- Explores the ethical tensions around exposing real people
- Includes the striking quote from the ex-girlfriend about being "punched in the face"
- Connects Knausgård's meditation on Hitler's writing to the Breivik attacks
- Ends with an unresolved question that mirrors the books' own ambiguity

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/my-struggle-knausgard-novels/index.html` once write permissions are granted.
