        I've prepared the rewritten article for "On Bullshit" but need write permission to save it. The article transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging 15-minute read that:

- Opens with Frankfurt's counterintuitive hook: liars respect truth more than bullshitters
- Explains the crucial distinction between lying (hiding truth you know) and bullshitting (indifference to truth)
- Traces Frankfurt's analysis from Max Black's concept of humbug
- Explores why bullshit is paradoxically worse than lying
- Connects the work to modern phenomena like large language models and "botshit"
- Links to David Graeber's related work on bullshit jobs
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for text-to-speech listening
- Matches the existing HTML template format from your other Wikipedia articles

Would you like me to save this file once I have permission?
