        I've written the complete rewritten article about memetics. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. It opens with a provocative hook about ideas as "mental parasites," covers the core concepts (selfish memes, memeplexes, meme machines), explores the internalist vs externalist debate, addresses the critics, chronicles the field's rise and fall, and concludes with reflections on what memetics means for how we think about our own beliefs.

The article is ready to be saved to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/memetics/index.html` once you grant write permissions for that directory.
