        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Dieter Rams. The essay transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. It opens with his powerful quote about indifference being the "cardinal sin" of design, traces his journey from post-war Germany through his Braun career, explains his famous Ten Principles, and includes the story of Jonathan Ive sending him an iPhone. I also added a section examining limitations of his philosophy to provide balance.

The HTML uses semantic markup with `<h2>` headings, `<p>` paragraphs, `<em>` for emphasis, and `<strong>` for the principle names. The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for audio rhythm, spells out concepts clearly, and connects his work to the Substack article's theme about clean UI design and de-emphasis.
