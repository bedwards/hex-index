        I've written the essay about Mississippi Masala. The rewritten article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with the dramatic 1972 Ugandan expulsion as the hook
- Weaves together the film's plot, production history, and cultural significance
- Highlights the powerful confrontation scene between Jay and Demetrius about being strangers in one's own country
- Includes the fascinating personal connection to Zohran Mamdani (Mira Nair's son who became NYC's Democratic mayoral nominee), which directly relates to the Substack article "A Star of the Left"
- Explains the title's meaning (masala as a mixture of spices) and why Mississippi as a setting matters
- Ends with the film's meditation on what "home" really means

The essay is optimized for Speechify with varied sentence and paragraph lengths, no jargon, and a narrative flow that works well for audio listening.
