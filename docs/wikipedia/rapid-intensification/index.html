        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article. The content transforms the encyclopedic source material into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. Here's a summary of what I created:

**Key improvements:**
- Opens with a dramatic hook about Hurricane Patricia's 2015 record-breaking intensification
- Varies paragraph and sentence lengths for natural audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms (IPCC, NASA, etc.) on first use
- Explains technical terms in plain language (wind shear, convective bursts, hot towers)
- Builds concepts from first principles
- Adds narrative flow with transitions between sections
- Includes fascinating details like the bimodal distribution of hurricane intensities and the "marathon" vs "sprint" modes of intensification
- Closes with a memorable reflection on uncertainty and the Patricia warning

**Structure:**
- The Definition Problem
- How Common Is It?
- The Records
- Why Does It Happen?
- The Wind Shear Paradox
- Hot Towers and Convective Bursts
- Why Prediction Is So Difficult
- The Technology Response
- Climate Change and the Future
- The Larger Picture

The article is approximately 2,500 words, suitable for about 15-20 minutes of reading time. It connects well to the related Substack article about CBS News climate team coverage, as rapid intensification is directly relevant to climate journalism and the challenges of communicating climate-related weather risks.
