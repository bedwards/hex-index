<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide">Wikipedia: Rwandan genocide</a></p>

<p>In one hundred days during the spring of 1994, neighbors murdered neighbors. Teachers killed their students. Doctors slaughtered their patients. In the small Central African nation of Rwanda, somewhere between half a million and a million people—mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group—were systematically exterminated in what became one of the most concentrated acts of mass murder in human history.</p>

<p>The killing was intimate and brutal. Unlike the industrial genocide of the Holocaust, with its gas chambers and crematoriums, the Rwandan genocide was carried out largely with machetes, clubs, and farming tools. Victims often knew their killers personally. They had shared meals with them, worshipped alongside them, watched their children play together.</p>

<p>How does a society reach such a point? The answer lies not in some ancient tribal hatred, but in a carefully constructed catastrophe—one that took decades of colonial manipulation, political cynicism, and deliberate dehumanization to engineer.</p>

<h2>The Myth of Ancient Tribal Conflict</h2>

<p>The story most people think they know about Rwanda goes something like this: the Hutu and Tutsi are two ancient tribes who have always hated each other, and in 1994 that hatred finally boiled over into genocide. This narrative is almost entirely wrong.</p>

<p>For centuries before European colonization, the people who lived in what is now Rwanda shared a common language, common customs, and common clan names. They were collectively known as the Banyarwanda. Yes, there were distinctions between groups—the Tutsi generally herded cattle while the Hutu farmed the land, and the Twa (an aboriginal pygmy population who had lived in the region for thousands of years) were hunter-gatherers. But these were more like occupational castes than rigid ethnic categories.</p>

<p>A wealthy Hutu could become a Tutsi. A poor Tutsi could become a Hutu. The boundaries were fluid.</p>

<p>By the eighteenth century, the Kingdom of Rwanda had emerged as the dominant power in the region, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan. Like many monarchies, it was hierarchical and sometimes brutal. King Kigeli Rwabugiri, who reigned from 1853 to 1895, expanded the kingdom and instituted reforms that created real tensions between Hutu and Tutsi—including forced labor systems that disproportionately burdened the Hutu. But these were political and economic conflicts, not the expression of some primordial ethnic hatred.</p>

<p>Then the Europeans arrived.</p>

<h2>The Colonial Creation of Race</h2>

<p>Germany claimed Rwanda (along with neighboring Burundi) at the Berlin Conference of 1884—that infamous gathering where European powers carved up Africa with rulers and pencils, drawing borders through the middle of ethnic groups and ecosystems with no regard for the people who actually lived there. The Germans didn't arrive in Rwanda until 1897, and when they did, they brought with them the racial pseudoscience that dominated European thinking at the time.</p>

<p>Looking at the Rwandan population, the Germans saw what they expected to see: racial categories. The Tutsi, who tended to be taller and had features the Europeans associated with the Horn of Africa, were deemed racially superior—perhaps descendants of migrants from Ethiopia, perhaps even connected to the biblical Ham. The Hutu, the Germans decided, were a lesser Bantu race. This wasn't observation; it was projection. The Europeans imposed their own obsession with racial hierarchy onto a society that had organized itself quite differently.</p>

<p>The Germans ruled through the existing Tutsi monarchy, finding it convenient to use local elites as intermediaries. When Belgium took over Rwanda during World War One, they continued and intensified this approach.</p>

<p>In the early 1930s, the Belgians did something that would echo through history with catastrophic consequences: they made ethnicity permanent and official. Every Rwandan was issued an identity card classifying them as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa, or Naturalized. The classification was somewhat arbitrary—in many cases, Belgian officials simply counted someone's cattle. Own ten or more? You're a Tutsi. Fewer than ten? Hutu.</p>

<p>What had been a fluid social distinction became a rigid racial category, printed on a card you carried with you everywhere. Movement between groups was now impossible. The identity cards would later serve as death warrants.</p>

<h2>The Hamitic Hypothesis</h2>

<p>The ideological foundation for what would become genocide was laid by Catholic missionaries and colonial administrators who promoted what's known as the "Hamitic hypothesis." This theory held that any signs of civilization in Africa must have been brought by a superior race from elsewhere—perhaps descendants of Ham, one of Noah's sons in the Bible, who had migrated south from the Middle East or North Africa.</p>

<p>The Tutsi, in this telling, weren't really African at all. They were foreign conquerors who had brought civilization to the primitive Hutu. This mythology had nothing to do with actual history or genetics—modern DNA analysis shows that Hutu and Tutsi are genetically nearly indistinguishable—but it served colonial purposes perfectly. It justified Tutsi privilege under Belgian rule and created a narrative that could later be weaponized.</p>

<p>The Tutsi themselves had their own origin myth, one that told a very different story: that the ancient king Kanyarwanda had several sons, including Gatutsi and Gahutu, making the Tutsi and Hutu brothers descended from the same ancestor. This narrative of shared ancestry and kinship was systematically suppressed in favor of the colonial racial framework.</p>

<h2>Revolution and Exile</h2>

<p>After World War Two, something shifted. The Catholic Church, which had previously supported Tutsi dominance, began to champion Hutu emancipation. A new generation of Hutu clergy and educated elites emerged, and they began to challenge the established order.</p>

<p>In 1957, a group of Hutu intellectuals published the "Bahutu Manifesto"—a document that, crucially, adopted the colonial racial framework rather than rejecting it. The manifesto didn't argue that the ethnic categories were false. Instead, it accepted them as real and called for power to be transferred from the minority Tutsi "race" to the majority Hutu based on what it called "statistical law." The language of democracy was being used to advance an ethnic agenda.</p>

<p>Violence erupted in November 1959, sparked by an attack on a Hutu leader that turned out to be non-fatal but was rumored to have been a murder. Hutu activists began killing Tutsis—both elites and ordinary civilians. The Belgians, who had spent decades elevating the Tutsi, now switched sides entirely, backing the Hutu uprising with administrative and military support.</p>

<p>By 1962, when Rwanda gained independence, the transformation was complete. The Tutsi monarchy was gone, replaced by a Hutu-dominated republic. And Tutsis were fleeing—not by the hundreds or thousands, but by the hundreds of thousands. By 1964, more than 300,000 Tutsi had become refugees in neighboring Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).</p>

<p>These refugees would spend the next thirty years in exile, never giving up hope of returning home.</p>

<h2>The Pressure Cooker</h2>

<p>Inside Rwanda, the new Hutu-led government proved just as autocratic as the monarchy it had replaced. Grégoire Kayibanda ruled through the 1960s and early 1970s, periodically scapegoating Tutsis to distract from his government's failures. He was overthrown in 1973 by Juvénal Habyarimana, a military officer who would rule Rwanda for the next two decades.</p>

<p>Habyarimana created a one-party state in which every citizen was required to belong to his party, the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (known by its French acronym MRND). It was a tightly controlled system, but for a time it brought relative stability and even modest economic growth. Violence against Tutsis decreased somewhat, though discrimination continued.</p>

<p>But pressure was building from multiple directions.</p>

<p>Rwanda's population had exploded from 1.6 million in 1934 to over 7 million by 1989. At 408 people per square kilometer, it had become one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Competition for land grew fierce. Young men with no prospects and no land were a volatile demographic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Uganda, a group of Rwandan Tutsi refugees had found an unexpected path to military experience. About 500 of them had fought alongside Yoweri Museveni in the Ugandan Bush War that brought him to power in 1986. These battle-hardened soldiers remained in the Ugandan army, but they were also secretly planning something else: an invasion of their homeland.</p>

<h2>The Rwandan Patriotic Front</h2>

<p>In October 1990, over 4,000 rebels crossed from Uganda into Rwanda under the banner of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RPF. They were led by Fred Rwigyema, a charismatic military commander who had been one of the highest-ranking officers in the Ugandan army.</p>

<p>Rwigyema was killed on the third day of the invasion—one of those accidents of history that could have changed everything. His deputy, Paul Kagame, took command. Kagame had been in the United States for military training when the invasion began and had to rush back to take over a force that was being pushed back by the Rwandan army, which had French and Zairean support.</p>

<p>Kagame retreated to the Virunga Mountains—the rugged volcanic range on Rwanda's northern border, famous as the home of mountain gorillas. From these forests and peaks, he rebuilt the RPF into an effective guerrilla force, recruiting from the Tutsi diaspora scattered across multiple countries and raising funds from refugee communities who had never stopped dreaming of return.</p>

<p>For the next three years, the RPF waged a grinding guerrilla war. They couldn't defeat the Rwandan army outright, but they couldn't be defeated either. International pressure eventually pushed both sides toward negotiations, and in August 1993, the Arusha Accords were signed. The agreements called for a power-sharing government that would include the RPF and integration of rebel soldiers into the national army.</p>

<p>A United Nations peacekeeping force—the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, or UNAMIR—arrived to monitor the implementation. The RPF even established a base in the parliament building in Kigali, the capital.</p>

<p>It looked like peace might actually come to Rwanda.</p>

<p>The extremists had other plans.</p>

<h2>The Architecture of Genocide</h2>

<p>From the moment the RPF invaded in 1990, hardliners in Habyarimana's government had been preparing for a different kind of solution. The president's wife, Agathe Habyarimana, came from a powerful northwestern clan that viewed any accommodation with Tutsis as betrayal. Her relatives and allies—known as the "akazu" or "little house," or sometimes the "clan de Madame"—had enormous influence behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The invasion gave these extremists exactly what they needed: a pretext to cast all Tutsis as a fifth column, potential collaborators with the enemy. Just days after the RPF attack, a pogrom in Gisenyi Province killed 383 Tutsis. It was a preview of what was to come.</p>

<p>The propaganda machine began to grind. A group of military officers and government officials founded a magazine called Kangura, which became enormously popular. It published viciously anti-Tutsi content, including the notorious "Hutu Ten Commandments"—a set of explicitly racist guidelines that, among other things, labeled any Hutu man who married a Tutsi woman a "traitor."</p>

<p>Radio was even more powerful in a country where many people couldn't read. Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, known as RTLM, mixed popular music and crude humor with relentless dehumanization of Tutsis, who were called "inyenzi"—cockroaches. The station would later broadcast kill lists and directions to roadblocks during the genocide itself.</p>

<p>The extremists employed a technique that scholars call "accusation in a mirror." They accused the Tutsis and RPF of planning exactly what they themselves intended to do. By claiming that Tutsis were plotting genocide against Hutus, they created a perverse justification for preemptive mass murder. Self-defense against an imaginary threat.</p>

<h2>The Youth Militias</h2>

<p>Throughout 1992 and 1993, as peace negotiations continued in Arusha, the extremists were building their instruments of death. Youth militias sprang up, attached to various political parties. The most notorious was the Interahamwe—a Kinyarwanda word meaning "those who stand together" or "those who attack together."</p>

<p>The Interahamwe were affiliated with Habyarimana's ruling party, but they represented its most radical faction. Young men, many of them unemployed and landless, were recruited with promises of power and eventually land and property confiscated from Tutsi victims. They were trained in the use of weapons and organized into units that could be deployed quickly.</p>

<p>By mid-1993, the extremist "Hutu Power" movement had become a third major force in Rwandan politics, alongside Habyarimana's government and the moderate opposition. Almost every political party split into "moderate" and "Power" wings, with each faction claiming to represent the party's legitimate leadership. Even Habyarimana's own party contained a Power faction that opposed his peace negotiations.</p>

<p>The president was caught between the international community pushing for the Arusha Accords and his own hardliners who saw those accords as surrender. He tried to remove some extremists from senior positions, but the akazu's tentacles went too deep. Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Théoneste Bagosora—both connected to the first lady's clan—remained in powerful military posts.</p>

<h2>The Trigger</h2>

<p>On the evening of April 6, 1994, a plane carrying President Habyarimana was shot down as it approached Kigali airport. Everyone on board was killed.</p>

<p>To this day, no one knows with certainty who fired the missiles. Some evidence points to Hutu extremists who saw Habyarimana as too willing to compromise; other evidence suggests the RPF. What is certain is that within hours of the crash, the genocide began.</p>

<p>The speed with which the killing started reveals how thoroughly it had been planned. Roadblocks went up across Kigali before dawn. Lists of names had already been prepared. The first victims were moderate Hutu politicians and prominent Tutsis—anyone who might organize resistance or provide alternative leadership.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, was murdered along with the ten Belgian peacekeepers assigned to protect her. The killing of the Belgians was deliberate—the extremists knew it would lead Belgium to withdraw its troops, removing the most capable contingent of the UN peacekeeping force.</p>

<p>They were right. Belgium pulled out. The UN Security Council, rather than reinforcing the mission, voted to reduce it to a skeleton force of just 270 soldiers.</p>

<h2>One Hundred Days</h2>

<p>What followed was slaughter on an almost incomprehensible scale. The killing spread from Kigali across the country in waves. Local officials, often under pressure from the central government and Interahamwe militias, organized the massacres in their areas. Radio RTLM broadcast encouragement and instructions. Roadblocks manned by militias and ordinary citizens checked identity cards—those cards the Belgians had introduced sixty years earlier.</p>

<p>Tutsi. That single word on a card meant death.</p>

<p>Many Tutsis fled to churches, schools, and other public buildings, hoping these would be sanctuaries. They became killing grounds instead. At the Nyamata Church, over 10,000 people were massacred. At the Murambi Technical School, French soldiers who arrived after most of the killing was over found bodies stacked in classroom after classroom—an estimated 50,000 dead.</p>

<p>The genocide was marked not just by mass murder but by systematic sexual violence. Between 250,000 and 500,000 women were raped. Many were deliberately infected with HIV. Rape was used as a weapon of terror and destruction, intended to devastate Tutsi families and communities even among survivors.</p>

<p>The international community watched and did nothing. The Clinton administration, scarred by the deaths of American soldiers in Somalia the previous year, refused to call what was happening "genocide"—because acknowledging genocide would have created legal obligations to intervene. Officials were instructed to say "acts of genocide" instead. France, which had long supported the Habyarimana government, continued to provide assistance to the génocidaires even as the killing continued.</p>

<p>The United Nations peacekeeping force, reduced to impotence by its shrinking numbers and restrictive mandate, could do little more than protect the few Tutsis who made it to their compounds. Some individual peacekeepers performed acts of extraordinary courage, but the mission as a whole was a catastrophic failure of international responsibility.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>The genocide ended not because the world intervened, but because the RPF won the war.</p>

<p>When the killing began, Paul Kagame resumed military operations. His forces pushed south from their mountain strongholds, defeating government troops and capturing territory. On July 4, they took Kigali. By July 19, they controlled the entire country.</p>

<p>As the RPF advanced, the génocidaires and hundreds of thousands of Hutu civilians fled westward into Zaire. Many of the refugees were genuinely afraid of RPF reprisals; many had participated in the killings. The refugee camps that formed just across the border became bases for the former regime, with Interahamwe and government soldiers controlling aid distribution and planning to continue the war.</p>

<p>This exodus would have consequences that continue to this day. The destabilization of eastern Zaire contributed to the First Congo War in 1996, which eventually drew in multiple African nations and led to millions of deaths—a conflict sometimes called "Africa's World War." The Democratic Republic of the Congo remains unstable partly because of dynamics set in motion during those terrible months in 1994.</p>

<h2>Aftermath and Memory</h2>

<p>The Rwanda that emerged from the genocide was a shattered nation. Perhaps 800,000 people had been killed—the exact number will never be known. The country's infrastructure was devastated. Survivors were traumatized. The social fabric that holds any society together had been torn apart in the most fundamental way possible.</p>

<p>Paul Kagame became the dominant figure in post-genocide Rwanda, first as vice president and minister of defense, then as president from 2000 to the present day. His government has achieved remarkable things: Rwanda is often cited as one of Africa's most orderly and least corrupt nations, with strong economic growth and dramatic improvements in health and education.</p>

<p>But Kagame's Rwanda is also authoritarian. The government has passed laws criminalizing "genocide ideology" and "divisionism"—categories that critics say are used to silence legitimate political opposition. Discussion of ethnicity is officially discouraged; Rwandans are supposed to identify simply as Rwandans now. Whether this represents genuine reconciliation or enforced amnesia is debated.</p>

<p>The gacaca courts—community tribunals that handled lower-level genocide cases—processed over a million suspects in an attempt to deliver some form of justice without the decades it would have taken to try everyone in conventional courts. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established by the UN, tried the architects and senior organizers of the genocide.</p>

<p>Every April, Rwanda observes Kwibuka—the national commemoration of the genocide. The word means "to remember" in Kinyarwanda. For one hundred days, from April 7 to July 19, the country officially mourns. Purple ribbons appear everywhere. Survivors share their testimonies. The nation confronts what it did to itself.</p>

<h2>What It Means</h2>

<p>The Rwandan genocide forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature and human institutions.</p>

<p>First: genocide is not spontaneous. It requires years of preparation—the dehumanization of a target group, the creation of parallel power structures, the stockpiling of weapons, the planning of logistics. The hundred days of killing in 1994 were preceded by decades of ideological groundwork and months of operational planning. This means that genocides can potentially be predicted and prevented, if the warning signs are heeded.</p>

<p>Second: ordinary people can become killers. The genocide wasn't carried out only by soldiers and militias. Neighbors killed neighbors. The man who murdered you might be someone you'd known your whole life, someone whose children had played with yours. Understanding how ordinary human beings cross that threshold—through propaganda, peer pressure, fear, greed, and the gradual erosion of moral constraints—is essential if we want to prevent future atrocities.</p>

<p>Third: the international community's promises of "never again" after the Holocaust rang hollow. When faced with actual genocide, the world's most powerful nations chose not to act. The reasons were various—political calculations, bureaucratic inertia, racism, the shadow of Somalia—but the result was abandonment. Rwanda revealed the gap between the rhetoric of universal human rights and the reality of how nations actually behave.</p>

<p>Fourth: colonialism's legacies are not just economic or political but psychological and ideological. The rigid ethnic categories that made the genocide possible were colonial creations. The racial ideology that justified Tutsi extermination was imported from Europe. This doesn't absolve Rwandans of responsibility for what they did, but it does mean that understanding the genocide requires understanding the deeper history of how Europeans reshaped African societies.</p>

<p>The Rwandan genocide happened within living memory. Many survivors are still alive. Many perpetrators are still alive. The wounds are still raw, even as Rwanda tries to build something new from the ashes.</p>

<p>It stands as a warning about where ethnic politics, dehumanizing propaganda, and international indifference can lead—and as a reminder that the unthinkable can happen, and has happened, in our time.</p>
