<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London">Wikipedia: Hyde Park, London</a></p>

<p>In 1982, a bomb in Hyde Park killed four soldiers and seven horses. The horses got their own memorial.</p>

<p>This detail tells you something essential about Hyde Park: it is a place so woven into British identity that even the animals who die there are commemorated in bronze. For nearly five centuries, this 350-acre rectangle of green in central London has served as hunting ground, plague camp, dueling field, protest site, concert venue, and winter carnival. It has witnessed the execution of soldiers, the coronation celebrations of kings, and a failed assassination attempt on a pope. The Great Exhibition of 1851 rose within its boundaries, housed in a glass cathedral so revolutionary that people simply called it the Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>And every December since 2007, this ancient royal land transforms into something its Tudor founders could never have imagined: Winter Wonderland, a sprawling Christmas market that has drawn over fourteen million visitors and become, depending on whom you ask, either a beloved tradition or an annual act of sacrilege against one of London's most storied spaces.</p>

<h2>A King's Hunting Ground</h2>

<p>Henry VIII created Hyde Park in 1536 by doing what Henry VIII did best: taking what he wanted. The land belonged to Westminster Abbey, part of a medieval manor called Hyde whose name derived from the Saxon word for a unit of land sufficient to support a single family. The Abbey's monks had used its woods for firewood and game shelter for centuries. Henry enclosed it as a deer park and kept it for himself.</p>

<p>For a hundred years, the park remained a private hunting preserve. James I allowed some access to gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to manage the land. In 1612, workers planted two hundred lime trees imported from the Low Countries and repaired the ponds. By 1619, the stakes had risen high enough that keepers armed with hail shot ambushed deer poachers. The poachers killed a keeper.</p>

<p>The park opened to the general public in 1637 under Charles I, and something remarkable happened: people actually came. May Day celebrations became so popular that even the upheaval of the English Civil War couldn't entirely suppress them. During the war's early years, fortifications rose along the park's eastern edge, including checkpoints where visitors to London could be vetted for their political loyalties.</p>

<p>Then Oliver Cromwell's Parliament did something unprecedented. In 1652, they sold the park.</p>

<p>The entire 620 acres went for £17,000, with an additional £765, six shillings, and tuppence for the deer. When the monarchy returned in 1660, Charles II took back the park, enclosed it with a brick wall, and restocked the deer. Samuel Pepys, the famous diarist, attended May Day celebrations there in 1663 while trying to curry favor with the restored king.</p>

<h2>The Road of Kings</h2>

<p>In 1689, William III moved to Kensington Palace on the far side of Hyde Park and needed a way to get there. He ordered a drive laid out across the park's southern edge: a wide, straight gravelled track leading from Hyde Park Corner toward his new residence.</p>

<p>This road became known as Rotten Row, and nobody agrees on why.</p>

<p>Some scholars trace the name to the French "Route du roi," meaning "King's Road." Others suggest "rotteran," an Old English word for mustering troops. A third theory points to "ratten row," meaning a roundabout way, while a fourth argues it simply describes the soft material covering the road surface. The competing etymologies have never been resolved.</p>

<p>What is certain is that Rotten Row became the first road in London to be lit at night. The lamps were installed to deter highwaymen. They didn't always work. In 1749, Horace Walpole, the writer and politician, was robbed while traveling through the park from Holland House. By the early nineteenth century, the wealthy used the row for recreational riding, turning what had been a practical commute into a display of social status.</p>

<h2>A Remarkably Violent Place</h2>

<p>Hyde Park in the eighteenth century was not the peaceful green space tourists photograph today. It was, statistically speaking, one of the most dangerous places in London if you were an aristocrat with a grievance.</p>

<p>One hundred seventy-two duels took place in the park during the century, killing sixty-three men.</p>

<p>The most famous occurred in 1712, when Charles Mohun, the fourth Baron Mohun, fought James Hamilton, the fourth Duke of Hamilton. Both men died. Baron Mohun fell instantly; the Duke survived only slightly longer. The cause of their dispute was a legal case over an inheritance, the kind of quarrel that today would be settled by expensive lawyers rather than drawn swords.</p>

<p>Other notable duels include the 1772 encounter between John Wilkes and Samuel Martin, and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan's fight with Captain Thomas Mathews over libellous comments about Sheridan's fiancée, Elizabeth Ann Linley. Edward Thurlow, who would later become Lord Chancellor, dueled Andrew Stuart in the park in 1770.</p>

<p>Military executions were also common. A 1746 map of London marks a point inside Hyde Park, near the Tyburn gallows where public hangings took place, with the notation: "where soldiers are shot."</p>

<h2>The Queen Who Shaped the Park</h2>

<p>The Hyde Park visitors see today owes much of its form to Queen Caroline, wife of George II. In 1726, her father-in-law George I commissioned the first coherent landscaping of the park, hiring Charles Bridgeman to redesign the space. When George I died the following year, Caroline continued the work with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Her most significant contribution was the Serpentine, the curved lake that remains the park's most recognizable feature. Workers created it by damming the River Westbourne, a stream that flows through the park from Kilburn toward the Thames. The project was completed in 1733, dividing Hyde Park from the newly created Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p>The Serpentine's name describes its shape: it curves like a snake through the landscape, a deliberate contrast to the geometric ponds and canals favored by earlier garden designers. This naturalistic approach, making artificial water features appear organic, represented the cutting edge of eighteenth-century landscape architecture.</p>

<p>The lake would later gain a companion. In 1826, George Rennie designed a bridge that now separates the Serpentine from the Long Water, its extension into Kensington Gardens. The two bodies of water look continuous but are technically distinct, managed by different parts of the Royal Parks administration.</p>

<h2>Celebrations and Spectacles</h2>

<p>The summer of 1814 brought a Great Fair to Hyde Park celebrating the Allied sovereigns' visit to England. Stalls and shows covered the grounds. On the Serpentine, crews reenacted the Battle of Trafalgar while a band played the National Anthem and the French fleet sank dramatically into the lake.</p>

<p>Seven years later, the coronation of George IV in 1821 was celebrated with another fair, this one featuring an air balloon and firework displays. The park had evolved from hunting ground to civic gathering place, a transformation that would reach its apex three decades later.</p>

<p>The Great Exhibition of 1851 was the most ambitious event ever staged in Hyde Park. Organizers erected the Crystal Palace on the park's south side: a structure of iron and glass covering over 990,000 square feet, designed by Joseph Paxton, a former gardener who had learned to work with glass while building greenhouses for the Duke of Devonshire. The building contained no interior walls or supports, creating a single vast exhibition hall lit entirely by natural light.</p>

<p>Six million people visited between May and October 1851, viewing industrial products and technological innovations from around the world. The exhibition generated a profit that helped fund the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, and the Natural History Museum in nearby South Kensington.</p>

<p>When the exhibition closed, the public made clear they did not want the Crystal Palace to remain in Hyde Park. Paxton raised funds, purchased the building, and had it moved piece by piece to Sydenham Hill in South London. There it stood until 1936, when fire destroyed it.</p>

<h2>The First Victoria Cross</h2>

<p>On June 26, 1857, Hyde Park hosted a ceremony that established one of Britain's most enduring military traditions. Queen Victoria personally decorated sixty-two men with the Victoria Cross, a new medal she had created the previous year to recognize exceptional valor in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Cross was revolutionary in one crucial respect: it could be awarded to soldiers of any rank. Previous military honors had been reserved for officers; the Victoria Cross acknowledged that common soldiers could demonstrate uncommon courage. The medal itself was made from bronze cannons captured during the Crimean War, and remains the highest award for gallantry in British and Commonwealth military forces.</p>

<p>Prince Albert attended the ceremony, along with other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia. The choice of Hyde Park as the venue reflected its status as the most important public gathering space in the nation's capital.</p>

<h2>Speaking Freely</h2>

<p>Hyde Park's northeastern corner, near Marble Arch, has served as a designated space for public speech since 1872. Speakers' Corner emerged from a simple practical reality: people were going to gather and speak whether the authorities liked it or not, so the government decided to establish a place where they could do so legally.</p>

<p>The location is significant. It sits near the former site of the Tyburn gallows, where public executions took place until 1783. Condemned prisoners were traditionally allowed final speeches before their deaths, creating an association between this ground and public address that predates the formal designation of Speakers' Corner by nearly a century.</p>

<p>Long before the corner received its official status, Hyde Park had hosted political movements that helped reshape British society. The Chartists gathered there in the 1840s, demanding voting rights for working men. The Reform League held demonstrations in the 1860s pushing for expanded suffrage. The suffragettes rallied there in the early twentieth century, demanding votes for women. More recently, the Stop the War Coalition has used the park for protests against British military interventions abroad.</p>

<p>The principle underlying Speakers' Corner is both simple and radical: in a democracy, people should be able to speak publicly about whatever they wish, even if their views are unpopular, offensive, or plainly wrong. The corner has hosted religious preachers, political extremists, conspiracy theorists, and ordinary citizens with grievances. Some speakers attract crowds; others address only pigeons. The point is that they can speak at all.</p>

<h2>The Grand Entrance</h2>

<p>For most of its history, Hyde Park's entrances were functional rather than impressive. This changed in the 1820s, when architect Decimus Burton designed a grand gateway at Hyde Park Corner that transformed how visitors experienced the transition from city to park.</p>

<p>Burton's design included the Screen, also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate: a colonnade of fluted Ionic columns with three carriage archways and two pedestrian entrances. The central gateway features a decorative frieze depicting a naval and military triumphal procession, designed by the son of a sculptor famous for making models of the Elgin Marbles. The iron gates were manufactured by Bramah, a company better known for making locks.</p>

<p>Burton also designed the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828 and originally formed a single composition with the Screen. The arch was intended to provide a monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, though it was moved in 1883, breaking the visual relationship Burton had intended. The arch originally supported a statue of the Duke of Wellington, which now stands in Aldershot.</p>

<p>English Heritage restored the Wellington Arch between 1999 and 2001. Visitors can now climb inside and view the parks from platforms above the porticoes, a perspective Burton's original visitors could never have experienced.</p>

<h2>Rock and Roll in the Royal Park</h2>

<p>The late twentieth century brought a new use for Hyde Park: large-scale free rock concerts that drew crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands. Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, and Queen all performed there, transforming the pastoral landscape into something closer to a festival ground.</p>

<p>These concerts built on a longer tradition of public entertainment in the park, but at a scale that would have astonished earlier generations. The logistics of staging a rock concert for hundreds of thousands of people in a nineteenth-century landscape designed for carriage rides and quiet contemplation required constant negotiation between preservation and public use.</p>

<p>The tradition continued into the twenty-first century. In 2005, Hyde Park hosted one of the Live 8 concerts, a series of benefit events organized to coincide with the G8 summit in Scotland. The London concert drew over 200,000 people to the park, making it one of the largest gatherings in the space's nearly five-hundred-year history as a public venue.</p>

<h2>Trees and Disease</h2>

<p>The Hyde Park of Queen Caroline's time was defined by its elm avenues, long corridors of trees that created shaded walks through the landscape. By the late twentieth century, those elms were dying.</p>

<p>Dutch elm disease swept through the park, killing over nine thousand trees. The disease, caused by a fungus spread by bark beetles, had arrived in Britain in the 1960s and proved almost impossible to control. Infected trees had to be felled and burned to prevent further spread.</p>

<p>The loss reshaped the park's character. Elms have a distinctive silhouette, different from any other common British tree. The replacement plantings of limes and maples create a different visual effect, one that visitors who never knew the original cannot miss but that longtime observers still mourn.</p>

<p>Today the park maintains four acres of greenhouses to grow bedding plants for the Royal Parks. A tree adoption scheme allows donors to fund the upkeep and maintenance of individual specimens. Among the park's botanical curiosities is a weeping beech known locally as "the upside-down tree," its branches cascading toward the ground in a form that seems to invert the normal relationship between trunk and canopy.</p>

<h2>Memorials</h2>

<p>A walk through Hyde Park is also a walk through British history, marked by memorials that commemorate triumphs and tragedies alike.</p>

<p>The Cavalry Memorial was built in 1924 at Stanhope Gate and moved to the Serpentine Road in 1961 when Park Lane was widened. South of the Serpentine stands the Diana, Princess of Wales memorial, an oval stone ring fountain opened on July 6, 2004. The design is meant to reflect Diana's life: water flows from the highest point in two directions, one calm and one turbulent, meeting at a still pool at the bottom.</p>

<p>Just beyond the dam at the eastern end of the Serpentine is Britain's Holocaust Memorial, commemorating the six million Jews and millions of others murdered by Nazi Germany. The 7 July Memorial commemorates the fifty-two people killed in the 2005 London bombings, when terrorists detonated explosives on three Underground trains and a bus.</p>

<p>In the Dell, at the center of the park's eastern section, stands a seven-ton monolith of Cornish stone. It was originally part of a drinking fountain, though an urban legend developed claiming it was brought from Stonehenge. It was not.</p>

<p>And near the Albert Gate, a memorial marks the 1982 bombing that killed four soldiers and seven horses. The horses were named Sefton, Dobell, Doreen, Dorell, Doyle, Duke, Doyal, and Doree. Their names are inscribed alongside the soldiers' names, because in Hyde Park, even the animals who die in service are remembered.</p>

<h2>Winter Wonderland</h2>

<p>Since 2007, Hyde Park has hosted Winter Wonderland, an annual Christmas event that runs from mid-November through early January. The event features Christmas markets, fairground rides, ice skating, circus performances, and an array of bars and restaurants serving seasonal food and drink.</p>

<p>Winter Wonderland has become one of the largest Christmas events in Europe. By 2016, it had attracted over fourteen million visitors total. The ice rink is the largest in London. The event has expanded year after year, adding new attractions and occupying more of the park's grounds.</p>

<p>The event is also controversial. Critics argue that it commercializes a historic green space, that the rides and stalls are overpriced, and that the crowds overwhelm the park's infrastructure. Supporters counter that it provides a festive gathering place and generates tourism revenue for London.</p>

<p>The debate over Winter Wonderland echoes debates that have surrounded Hyde Park for centuries. How should a public space balance preservation and use? Who decides what activities are appropriate? Can a royal hunting ground also be a Christmas carnival?</p>

<p>Henry VIII took the land for deer. Charles I opened it to the public. Queen Caroline landscaped it. Joseph Paxton filled it with glass. Rock bands filled it with sound. And now, every winter, fourteen million fairy lights fill it with something else entirely.</p>

<p>The park endures. It has survived plague and bombs and Dutch elm disease. It has hosted duels and executions and papal visits. It has seen the wealthy parade on Rotten Row and the passionate speak at Speakers' Corner. For nearly five hundred years, Hyde Park has been whatever London has needed it to be.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is the point. A space this old, this central, this contested belongs not to any single vision but to all of them, layered one atop another like the annual rings of its remaining trees.</p>
