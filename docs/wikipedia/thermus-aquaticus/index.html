        I've written a complete rewrite of the Thermus aquaticus Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for Speechify reading. The article is ready to be saved to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/thermus-aquaticus/index.html`, but I need permission to create files in that directory.

The rewritten article:
- Opens with a compelling hook about Brock's 1969 discovery in Yellowstone
- Explains thermophilic biology from first principles (why heat normally destroys proteins, how this bacterium evolved to survive)
- Tells the story of PCR development and Taq polymerase's crucial role
- Covers the controversies around intellectual property (Mullis's $10,000 vs $300M patent sale, the "Great Taq Rip-off")
- Connects to broader themes: extremophiles, astrobiology, CRISPR, and the value of basic research
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio listening
- Spells out all acronyms (PCR, CRISPR, etc.) on first use
- Runs approximately 3,500 words (~15-20 minutes reading time)

Would you like me to try writing to a different location, or can you grant permission for the docs/wikipedia directory?
