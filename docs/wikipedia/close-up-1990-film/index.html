<p>A poor man rides a bus in Tehran, clutching a screenplay. A wealthy woman sits beside him and mentions she loved the film that screenplay became. In that moment, he makes a choice that will change both their lives: he tells her he is the director who made it.</p>

<p>This is the true story behind <em>Close-Up</em>, a 1990 Iranian film that begins with a lie and ends up revealing more truth about human nature than most honest documentaries ever manage. The film has been called one of the greatest ever made—not because of its budget, its stars, or its special effects, but because of the audacious question it asks: What happens when a nobody pretends to be a somebody, and what does that pretense reveal about all of us?</p>

<h2>The Con Artist Who Just Wanted to Be Seen</h2>

<p>Hossain Sabzian was a film lover. That description doesn't quite capture it. He was obsessed with cinema, particularly the work of Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose films about the struggles of ordinary people resonated deeply with Sabzian's own difficult life. Makhmalbaf made movies about bicycle racers and the poor, about people who suffered and endured. Sabzian saw himself in those films.</p>

<p>One day in the late 1980s, Sabzian was riding public transit in northern Tehran with a copy of Makhmalbaf's screenplay for <em>The Cyclist</em>. A woman named Mrs. Ahankhah sat next to him and noticed the book. She told him she was a fan of the film.</p>

<p>What happened next wasn't planned. Sabzian told her he was Makhmalbaf himself.</p>

<p>The woman was thrilled. She mentioned that her sons were interested in filmmaking. Sabzian—now fully inhabiting his role—said he would love to meet them. Over the next two weeks, he visited the Ahankhah family multiple times, each visit deepening the deception. He told them he wanted to use their house as a location in his next film. He promised their sons roles as actors. He borrowed a small amount of money for cab fare—1,900 tomans, a modest sum.</p>

<p>The Ahankhahs were a middle-class family, and being chosen by a famous director felt like validation. They welcomed Sabzian into their home. They believed.</p>

<h2>The Unraveling</h2>

<p>Mr. Ahankhah, the father, grew suspicious. It wasn't just intuition. He came across a magazine photograph of the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf—a younger man with darker hair, clearly not the person eating dinner at his table. The deception had a shelf life, and it was expiring.</p>

<p>Rather than confront Sabzian directly, Mr. Ahankhah invited a journalist named Hossain Farazmand to the house. Farazmand confirmed what the family feared: this man was an impostor.</p>

<p>The police arrived. Sabzian was arrested. Farazmand snapped photographs for his article, which would run under the headline "Bogus Makhmalbaf Arrested."</p>

<p>This is where the story might have ended—a small-time con man caught, a brief item in the newspapers, forgotten within days. But another filmmaker was reading that newspaper article.</p>

<h2>Kiarostami Sees a Movie</h2>

<p>Abbas Kiarostami was already a respected Iranian director when he read about Sabzian's arrest in the magazine Sorush. He was in the middle of pre-production on another film, but he stopped everything. Something about this story grabbed him and wouldn't let go.</p>

<p>What fascinated Kiarostami wasn't the crime itself—the fraud was petty, the money borrowed trivial. What fascinated him was the psychology. Why would someone impersonate a film director? What need was being filled? And more intriguingly: what did this say about the power of cinema, the nature of identity, the desperate human desire to be someone who matters?</p>

<p>Kiarostami visited Sabzian in prison. He helped advance the trial date. He obtained permission from the judge to film the actual court proceedings. Then he did something that would make <em>Close-Up</em> unlike almost any other film: he convinced everyone involved—Sabzian, the Ahankhah family, the journalist, even the real Makhmalbaf—to participate in recreating the events that had led to this moment.</p>

<p>Everyone would play themselves.</p>

<h2>Documentary, Fiction, or Something Else Entirely</h2>

<p>What is <em>Close-Up</em>? The question isn't rhetorical. Film critics and scholars have been arguing about it since 1990, and there's no consensus because the film deliberately resists categorization.</p>

<p>The trial footage is real. That actually happened. A camera was in the courtroom as Sabzian faced charges of fraud and attempted fraud. His testimony—that he posed as Makhmalbaf because of his deep love for cinema and the way those films made him feel seen in his own suffering—was spoken under oath.</p>

<p>But the scenes showing the bus ride, the visits to the Ahankhah home, the arrest? Those are recreations, performed after the fact by the same people who lived them. Mrs. Ahankhah reenacts meeting Sabzian on the bus. The sons reenact welcoming the fake director into their home. Sabzian reenacts his own deception.</p>

<p>This creates a strange loop. You're watching people pretend to be themselves at an earlier time, playing roles they actually lived. But is that different from acting? When Sabzian pretended to be Makhmalbaf, was he acting? When he now pretends to be himself pretending to be Makhmalbaf, how many layers of performance are we witnessing?</p>

<p>The term for this genre is "docufiction"—a hybrid that blends documentary and fiction techniques. But that label feels too clinical for what Kiarostami achieved. <em>Close-Up</em> doesn't just mix documentary and fiction; it asks whether the distinction between them was ever real in the first place.</p>

<h2>The Trial: A Man Explains Himself</h2>

<p>The courtroom scenes are the heart of the film, and they contain some of the most quietly devastating moments in cinema.</p>

<p>Sabzian, facing the judge, doesn't defend himself by denying what he did or minimizing it. Instead, he tries to explain. He talks about his love for Makhmalbaf's films and how they spoke to his own experience of suffering. He says that when he pretended to be the director, he felt like someone for the first time. The Ahankhahs listened to him. They respected him. They treated him as a person who mattered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He feels seen in his own suffering through these films.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the confession of a man who discovered that impersonating someone important was the only way he could experience what it felt like to be valued. The con wasn't really about money—1,900 tomans was nothing. The con was about dignity, about being treated as someone worth listening to, about escaping the invisibility of poverty.</p>

<p>The judge, noting that Sabzian is a young father with no prior record and seems genuinely remorseful, asks the Ahankhah family if they would be willing to pardon him. In Iranian law, victims of certain crimes can choose to forgive the perpetrator, which affects the sentence.</p>

<p>The family agrees. They ask only that Sabzian commit to becoming a productive member of society.</p>

<h2>The Meeting</h2>

<p>Kiarostami arranged something remarkable for the film's conclusion. After the trial, he brought together the two men whose identities had become so strangely intertwined: Hossain Sabzian and the real Mohsen Makhmalbaf.</p>

<p>The footage of their meeting is technically imperfect. The sound cuts in and out, ostensibly due to equipment problems. Some viewers have speculated that Kiarostami did this intentionally, creating a gap in our knowledge, forcing us to imagine what passed between these two men.</p>

<p>Makhmalbaf gives Sabzian a ride on his motorcycle to the Ahankhah home. Kiarostami's crew follows at a distance. When they arrive, Mr. Ahankhah sees Sabzian again—not the fake director, but the real man who deceived his family.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I hope he'll be good now and make us proud of him."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The film ends with this moment of fragile reconciliation, a hope expressed but not guaranteed, a story without a clean resolution.</p>

<h2>Failure in Iran, Discovery Abroad</h2>

<p>When <em>Close-Up</em> opened in Iranian theaters, critics savaged it. The reviews were almost uniformly negative. The film's hybrid nature confused and alienated audiences expecting either straightforward documentary or conventional drama.</p>

<p>Its reputation grew slowly, from abroad. American critic Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called it "brilliant" and praised its "radically drab cinema-verite style that helps blur any difference between what is real and what is reconstructed." Cinema verite, French for "truth cinema," is a documentary approach that emphasizes authenticity and minimal directorial interference—though Kiarostami was subverting even that by having his subjects perform their own lives.</p>

<p>By 2012, <em>Close-Up</em> appeared on the Sight & Sound poll of the greatest films ever made, a decennial survey of critics published by the British Film Institute and considered the most prestigious ranking in cinema. In the 2022 edition, it ranked seventeenth.</p>

<p>Seventeenth greatest film of all time. A movie about a poor man pretending to be a director, made for almost nothing, rejected in its home country, gradually recognized as a masterpiece.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>There's something almost too perfect about <em>Close-Up</em>'s subject matter for a film about the power of film. Sabzian committed his fraud because cinema meant something to him—because seeing stories about people like himself on screen made him feel less alone. And then Kiarostami made a film about that fraud, which itself became one of the most celebrated films in history, which means even more people now know Sabzian's name than ever knew Makhmalbaf's before.</p>

<p>The man who pretended to be a famous director became, through the documentary about his pretending, more famous than he would have been if he'd never pretended at all.</p>

<p>Filmmaker Ashim Ahluwalia, including <em>Close-Up</em> in his personal top ten for the Sight & Sound poll, described it as "a re-enactment of a re-enactment of a re-enactment" that "essentially destroys the very conception of a 'documentary' and yet is one of the best ever made." Martin Scorsese has cited Kiarostami as a major influence. Italian director Nanni Moretti made a short film about a theater owner preparing to screen <em>Close-Up</em> at his independent cinema.</p>

<p>The ripples keep spreading.</p>

<h2>After the Camera Stopped</h2>

<p>Five years after <em>Close-Up</em>, two filmmakers made a follow-up documentary called <em>Close-Up Long Shot</em>. They found Sabzian and filmed him talking about his infatuation with cinema, his impersonation, and how his life had changed since appearing in Kiarostami's film. That documentary won a special mention for the FIPRESCI Prize—the award given by the International Federation of Film Critics—at the Turin Film Festival in 1996.</p>

<p>In August 2006, Hossain Sabzian collapsed on the Tehran metro. He had suffered respiratory failure. He slipped into a coma and never recovered, dying on September 29 at the age of fifty-two.</p>

<p>He spent the last sixteen years of his life as a minor celebrity, known not for being a director but for wanting to be one so badly that he convinced a family he already was. His obituaries mentioned that he was the subject of a film many considered among the greatest ever made.</p>

<h2>What the Film Asks</h2>

<p>Every viewer takes something different from <em>Close-Up</em>. Some see it as a meditation on Iranian society—the class divisions that made Sabzian's deception feel necessary, the cultural importance of cinema in a country where other forms of expression were restricted. Los Angeles Times critic Dennis Lim wrote that the film provides "a window into the psyche of a complicated man and into the social and cultural reality of Iran."</p>

<p>Others see it as pure film theory made watchable—an exploration of what documentary means, what acting means, what truth means when everyone is performing versions of themselves.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most affecting reading is the simplest. <em>Close-Up</em> is about a man who felt invisible until he pretended to be someone else. When he was Makhmalbaf, people listened to him. They invited him to dinner. They dreamed alongside him. When he was Sabzian, he was nobody.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that his crime revealed something true about himself—his genuine love of cinema, his emotional intelligence, his ability to connect with people—that might have earned him respect if he'd just been given the chance to show it honestly. The family liked him. They were hurt by the deception, but they forgave him. In the end, they seemed to understand that what he wanted wasn't money or access. He wanted to matter.</p>

<p>Who hasn't wanted that?</p>

<h2>The Legacy of Ambiguity</h2>

<p>Kiarostami went on to become one of the most celebrated filmmakers in world cinema, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1997 for <em>Taste of Cherry</em> and influencing generations of directors before his death in 2016. His other films include the Koker trilogy, <em>The Wind Will Carry Us</em>, and <em>Certified Copy</em>—all of which continue the philosophical explorations that <em>Close-Up</em> began.</p>

<p>Mohsen Makhmalbaf, the director Sabzian impersonated, made his own contribution to the legacy. His 1995 film <em>Hello Cinema</em> shows ordinary Iranians being auditioned, each explaining why they want to act in a film. It's impossible not to see Sabzian's influence—a film directly engaging with the gap between who people are and who they dream of becoming.</p>

<p>And somewhere in the middle of all this sits <em>Close-Up</em> itself, a film that refuses to tell you what's real and what's performance, that features a con man playing himself while a documentary crew films the recreation of events they helped stage. It is eighty-eight minutes of pure ambiguity, and somehow that ambiguity feels more honest than most films that claim to tell the truth.</p>

<p>The cameras captured what happened. But what happened was already a performance. And the performance was about the desire to be seen as someone worth watching.</p>

<p>All of which is to say: the film is called <em>Close-Up</em> for a reason. Look closely at Sabzian's face in the courtroom. Look at the Ahankhahs as they reenact their own humiliation. Look at Makhmalbaf as he meets the man who stole his identity. What you see there—whatever it is—might be the only truth the film offers.</p>
