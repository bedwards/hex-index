        I've prepared the rewritten article on abductive reasoning. The content is ready—here's what I've created:

**Article: Abductive Reasoning**  
**Read time: ~15 minutes**

The essay transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - the wet lawn scenario that immediately demonstrates abductive reasoning in action
2. **Explains the three types of reasoning** - clearly differentiating abduction from deduction and induction
3. **Uses the Sherlock Holmes example** - a relatable illustration of how Holmes's "deduction" is actually abduction
4. **Covers the Neptune discovery** - showing abduction in scientific practice
5. **Includes Peirce's quotes** - the beautiful passage about seeing an azalea
6. **Discusses modern applications** - AI, medical diagnosis, legal reasoning
7. **Addresses failure modes** - availability bias, confirmation bias, jumping to conclusions
8. **Ends with practical wisdom** - how understanding abduction improves thinking

The HTML follows the existing template structure from other Wikipedia articles in the library, with semantic markup optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.

Would you like me to proceed with writing this file? I need permission to create the directory `docs/wikipedia/abductive-reasoning/` and write the HTML file.
