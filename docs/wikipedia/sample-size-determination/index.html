        I've written a rewritten article on sample size determination that transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article:

1. **Opens with a hook** - posing the question of how many people you need to ask before trusting an answer
2. **Explains concepts from first principles** - building up from the law of large numbers and central limit theorem
3. **Uses concrete examples** - the 1936 Literary Digest poll, presidential polling, blood pressure drug trials
4. **Varies paragraph and sentence length** - creating rhythm for audio listening
5. **Spells out concepts clearly** - explaining confidence levels, margins of error, and variability in plain language
6. **Covers the key topics** - proportions, means, statistical power, Cohen's d, simulation methods, and Mead's resource equation
7. **Ends with practical relevance** - how to apply this knowledge when reading polls and studies

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/sample-size-determination/index.html` once permissions are granted.
