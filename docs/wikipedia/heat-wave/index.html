        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article on heat waves. The article transforms the encyclopedic source material into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here are the key elements:

**Opening hook**: Starts with the dramatic 2003 French heat wave that killed 15,000 people, rather than a dry definition.

**Structure**: The essay flows through:
- What constitutes a heat wave (with varied national definitions)
- The physics of how heat waves form and get "stuck"
- Hidden amplifiers like soil moisture
- Marine heat waves
- Human physiological limits and wet-bulb temperature
- Behavioral effects (cognitive impairment, violence correlation)
- Economic consequences
- Air quality connections
- Future trajectory and climate change implications

**Writing style optimized for Speechify**:
- Varied paragraph lengths (some single sentences, some longer explanations)
- Varied sentence lengths for natural rhythm
- Technical terms explained immediately (adiabatic heating, wet-bulb temperature, bergwind)
- No unexplained acronyms
- Conversational transitions between sections

The article is ready to be written once file write permissions are granted. Would you like me to proceed when permissions are available, or would you like any adjustments to the content?
