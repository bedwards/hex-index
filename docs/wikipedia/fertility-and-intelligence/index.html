        I've written the essay transforming the Wikipedia article on "Fertility and Intelligence" into an engaging, Speechify-optimized piece. Here's what the rewritten article includes:

**Key improvements made:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about the paradox rather than a dry definition
- Varied paragraph lengths for audio rhythm
- Explains technical terms (dysgenic/eugenic, Flynn Effect, path analysis) in plain language
- Builds the narrative chronologically, showing how understanding evolved over a century
- Adds context about controversial researchers and the field's troubled history
- Explains the surprising finding that IQ scores have actually been rising despite differential fertility
- Varies sentence structure throughout for better listening experience
- Concludes with thoughtful reflection rather than just summarizing

The article is approximately 2,400 words, providing about 15-20 minutes of reading time with Speechify.
