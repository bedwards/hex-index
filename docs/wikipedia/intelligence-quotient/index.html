        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on Intelligence Quotient. The essay is ready but I need permission to write it to the file system. Here's what the essay covers:

**Structure:**
- Opens with the dramatic story of Carrie Buck and the 1927 Supreme Court decision
- Traces the history from Francis Galton's failed physical measurements to Binet's practical school tests
- Explains how the "quotient" got its name and what it actually means
- Covers America's adoption and misuse of IQ tests, including the Army tests and immigration restrictions
- Details the deep connection between IQ testing and eugenics
- Explores what IQ tests actually measure (and don't measure)
- Discusses the Flynn effect and modern theories of multiple intelligences
- Addresses ongoing controversies and the scientific consensus
- Returns to Carrie Buck's story for a poignant conclusion

**Writing approach:**
- Varied paragraph lengths (short punchy ones mixed with longer explanatory sections)
- Narrative flow with clear transitions
- Technical terms explained from first principles
- Numbers spelled out for Speechify compatibility
- Strong hook that doesn't bury the lede
- Personal stories to humanize the statistics

Would you like me to output the HTML content directly, or would you prefer to grant write permissions so I can save it to the file?
