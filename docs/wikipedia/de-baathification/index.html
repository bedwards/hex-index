        I've written the essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on De-Ba'athification. Here's the complete HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification">Wikipedia: De-Ba'athification</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 2003, a policy drafted by a handful of mid-level Pentagon officials would unravel an entire country. The decision took weeks to write. Its consequences lasted decades.</p>

<p>De-Ba'athification—the systematic purge of anyone connected to Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath Party from Iraqi public life—remains one of the most controversial decisions of the American occupation. Its architects compared it to denazification, the Allied program to cleanse Germany of Nazi influence after World War II. But where denazification had been planned for nearly five years before Germany's surrender, de-Ba'athification was cobbled together in roughly sixty days. The results would prove catastrophic.</p>

<h2>What the Ba'ath Party Actually Was</h2>

<p>To understand why this policy mattered so much, you need to understand what the Ba'ath Party was—and wasn't.</p>

<p>The Ba'ath Party in Iraq wasn't simply a political organization in the way Americans might think of the Democratic or Republican parties. It was the connective tissue of Iraqi society under Saddam Hussein's rule. Want to be a teacher? Join the party. A doctor? Join the party. A mid-level bureaucrat who processed paperwork? You'd better believe you needed that party membership card.</p>

<p>By some estimates, the party had between one and two million members in a country of roughly twenty-five million people. The vast majority weren't ideological true believers or war criminals. They were ordinary Iraqis who understood that party membership was the price of admission to professional life.</p>

<p>This creates a dilemma that haunts every post-authoritarian transition. How do you distinguish between the schoolteacher who joined because she had to and the secret police officer who tortured dissidents? How do you remove the regime's enablers without decapitating the very institutions you need to rebuild?</p>

<h2>Sixty Days to Plan an Occupation</h2>

<p>The Allied powers spent nearly five years planning the post-war occupations of Germany and Japan. They debated policy, established clear chains of command, and prepared detailed guidance for every contingency. When American soldiers marched into Berlin or Tokyo, they carried binders full of instructions.</p>

<p>The planning for Iraq's occupation began on January 20, 2003—exactly sixty days before the invasion.</p>

<p>That's not a typo. Two months. To plan the reconstruction of a nation of twenty-five million people, with complex ethnic and religious divisions, in a region Americans barely understood.</p>

<p>The idea of de-Ba'athification originated with Ahmad Chalabi and his organization, the Iraqi National Congress. Chalabi was an Iraqi exile who had left the country decades earlier and had become a favorite of certain Pentagon officials despite being distrusted by the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department. His comparison of the Ba'ath Party to the Nazis resonated with Douglas Feith, who headed a Pentagon unit called the Office of Special Plans.</p>

<p>The name sounds bureaucratic. The office was anything but. It had been created to develop alternative intelligence analyses and policy recommendations, often at odds with the mainstream intelligence community. It was from this office that de-Ba'athification would emerge.</p>

<h2>The March Compromise That Wasn't</h2>

<p>On March 10, 2003—just ten days before the invasion—the National Security Council convened to settle a fierce disagreement about how far de-Ba'athification should go.</p>

<p>The Defense Department wanted a sweeping purge. Anyone with any connection to the party should be removed from public life. The State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency argued for something more targeted—what they called "de-Saddamification." Focus on the top leadership. Go after people accused of actual crimes. Leave the bureaucratic machinery intact.</p>

<p>A compromise emerged. The top leadership would be removed, and a South African-style Truth and Reconciliation council would assess the culpability of lower-level members. It seemed reasonable. It balanced justice with pragmatism.</p>

<p>It was also ignored.</p>

<p>The Office of Special Plans drafted its own version anyway—the expansive purge the Defense Department had always wanted. This draft would become the actual policy, the compromise be damned.</p>

<h2>The Man Who Delivered the Order</h2>

<p>Paul Bremer arrived in Iraq on May 12, 2003, to take charge of the Coalition Provisional Authority. He was the highest American authority in the country, the de facto ruler of Iraq. Three days later, he would sign the order that many historians believe sealed Iraq's fate.</p>

<p>Before leaving Washington, Bremer had met with Douglas Feith and received his first briefing on de-Ba'athification. The final draft of the order was sent by courier to Iraq after Bremer arrived. On May 15, he sent a draft copy to General Jay Garner, who had been running the occupation effort until Bremer's arrival.</p>

<p>The next day, Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 1 went into effect.</p>

<p>Years later, in an interview, Bremer told Garner simply: "I was given my orders." Garner understood this to mean that Bremer wasn't the author of the policy—he was its executor. The real decisions had been made in Washington, in the Office of Special Plans, by people who had never set foot in Iraq.</p>

<h2>What Order Number 1 Actually Did</h2>

<p>The language of the order was sweeping. All members of the Ba'ath Party, from senior leadership down to the rank of "Udw"—ordinary member—were to be "removed from their positions and banned from future employment in the public sector."</p>

<p>Think about what this meant in practice.</p>

<p>Iraq's government employed roughly two million people. The order applied to all of them. Teachers, engineers, water treatment plant operators, electrical grid technicians, hospital administrators—anyone who had joined the party to keep their job was now unemployed.</p>

<p>The military and security services, dissolved under a companion order issued a week later, added hundreds of thousands more to the unemployment rolls. These were trained, armed men with no income, no prospects, and a burning grievance against the Americans who had destroyed their livelihoods.</p>

<p>The order did include a provision for appeals and exemptions. But in the chaos of post-invasion Iraq, with looting consuming government buildings and basic services collapsing, the appeals process was more theoretical than real. The damage was done.</p>

<h2>The Orders That Followed</h2>

<p>Order Number 1 was just the beginning. Over the following weeks, the Coalition Provisional Authority issued a cascade of additional orders that extended and deepened de-Ba'athification.</p>

<p>Order Number 2, issued on May 23, dissolved entire government institutions—not just their Ba'athist members, but the organizations themselves. The Iraqi army. The intelligence services. The presidential security units. The Ministry of Defense. All of it, gone. The order also froze the financial assets of these dissolved entities and placed them under American control.</p>

<p>Order Number 4, two days later, went after Ba'ath Party property and assets. Anything owned by the party, or received by party members as rewards, was subject to seizure. Failing to report knowledge of such assets was punishable by a thousand-dollar fine or a year in prison—in a country where the average annual income was a fraction of that amount.</p>

<p>Order Number 5 established an Iraqi De-Ba'athification Council to help enforce these policies. But the council served at the pleasure of the American administrator and could be overruled at any time. It was Iraqi in name only.</p>

<h2>The Architects and Their Absence</h2>

<p>What's striking about de-Ba'athification is how few people actually made the decision—and how many claim they weren't consulted.</p>

<p>Colin Powell, then Secretary of State, described his reaction in a 2016 interview: "I wasn't told about it. Condi wasn't told about it. The president wasn't told about it. The CIA was stunned, and the commanders in the field out there were stunned."</p>

<p>Condoleezza Rice was the National Security Advisor. Her job was to coordinate policy among the various agencies. If she wasn't told, something had gone badly wrong with the policy process.</p>

<p>George Tenet, then director of the Central Intelligence Agency, later wrote that the CIA "knew nothing about it until de-Ba'athification was a fait accompli." He called it "a critical policy decision" made without any meeting of the National Security Council principals to debate it.</p>

<p>Powell recalls calling Rice after learning what had happened. She told him that Paul Bremer had made the decision and it wasn't their place to overturn it. But Bremer himself had told Jay Garner that he was following orders from above.</p>

<p>Someone made this decision. But decades later, no one seems willing to take responsibility for it.</p>

<h2>The Denazification Comparison</h2>

<p>The architects of de-Ba'athification loved comparing their policy to denazification. The parallel seemed obvious: remove the members of a totalitarian party from power, allow new democratic institutions to flourish, and move on. It worked in Germany. Why not Iraq?</p>

<p>But the comparison obscures more than it reveals.</p>

<p>Denazification in Germany was planned for years, not weeks. It was implemented by an occupation force of millions, not the roughly 150,000 troops the United States deployed to Iraq. It took place in a country that had been utterly defeated, its cities reduced to rubble, its population exhausted and demoralized. Germany's neighbors were hostile powers who would have crushed any insurgency. Iraq's neighbors—Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia—had their own reasons to meddle.</p>

<p>Perhaps most importantly, denazification was eventually abandoned. By the late 1940s, American occupation authorities realized that purging every Nazi Party member was impractical. Former party members were quietly rehabilitated, their expertise deemed necessary for rebuilding. The policy that de-Ba'athification was supposed to emulate had itself been recognized as a mistake and reversed.</p>

<p>In Iraq, there would be no such course correction—at least not until the damage was done.</p>

<h2>The Sectarian Dimension</h2>

<p>The Ba'ath Party in Iraq, while officially secular, had become closely associated with the country's Sunni Arab minority under Saddam Hussein. Sunnis, who made up roughly twenty percent of Iraq's population, had dominated the party's upper ranks and the security services.</p>

<p>De-Ba'athification, whatever its intentions, hit Sunni communities hardest. The teachers and engineers and bureaucrats who lost their jobs were disproportionately Sunni. The dissolved military officers were disproportionately Sunni. The neighborhoods that suddenly had no income, no prospects, and a bitter sense of dispossession were disproportionately Sunni.</p>

<p>Many Iraqis, particularly Shia and Kurdish communities who had suffered under Saddam's rule, welcomed the purge. They saw it as long-overdue justice. But for Sunnis, it felt like collective punishment—guilt by association with a party most had joined out of necessity, not conviction.</p>

<p>This grievance would fuel the insurgency that consumed Iraq for years afterward. Unemployed soldiers became insurgents. Disbanded intelligence officers brought their expertise to the resistance. The very people who might have stabilized post-war Iraq became its most destabilizing force.</p>

<h2>The Voices of Opposition</h2>

<p>Not everyone in the American government supported de-Ba'athification. In fact, significant opposition existed—it was simply overruled or ignored.</p>

<p>General Jay Garner, who had been running the initial occupation effort, was horrified when he learned what Bremer planned to do. The State Department had advocated for a more targeted approach. The Central Intelligence Agency warned that sweeping purges would create exactly the kind of chaos that followed.</p>

<p>Colonel Paul Hughes, who served as Director of Strategic Policy for the occupation in 2003, opposed the policy. So did Ambassador Barbara Bodine, who had extensive Middle East experience. Robert Hutchings, who chaired the National Intelligence Council from 2003 to 2005, raised concerns. Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, Colin Powell's chief of staff, would later become one of the policy's most vocal critics.</p>

<p>These weren't naive peaceniks or armchair critics. They were experienced military and diplomatic professionals who understood Iraq, understood occupations, and understood that you cannot rebuild a country by firing everyone who knows how it works.</p>

<p>They were ignored.</p>

<h2>The Policy's Afterlife</h2>

<p>The Coalition Provisional Authority officially rescinded de-Ba'athification on June 28, 2004, as part of the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi Interim Government. But the policy didn't end—it transformed.</p>

<p>The Iraqi Governing Council, and later the elected Iraqi Parliament, continued elements of de-Ba'athification under Iraqi control. What had been an American occupation policy became an Iraqi political tool, wielded by various factions against their rivals. The sectarian damage had already been done; now Iraqi politicians could perpetuate it.</p>

<p>The scars of de-Ba'athification shaped Iraqi politics for decades. Sunni alienation from the political process contributed to the rise of extremist groups, culminating in the emergence of the Islamic State in 2014. The very chaos that critics had warned about came to pass, on a scale even they hadn't imagined.</p>

<h2>Syria's Echo</h2>

<p>In December 2024, following the fall of the Assad regime, Syria began its own process of de-Ba'athification. The Syrian Ba'ath Party, a separate organization from its Iraqi counterpart despite sharing the same ideological roots, faced dissolution under the new caretaker government.</p>

<p>Whether Syria will repeat Iraq's mistakes remains to be seen. The parallel is uncomfortable. Different country, different circumstances, different moment in history—but the same fundamental question. How do you dismantle an authoritarian system without destroying the society it governed?</p>

<h2>The Lessons That Weren't Learned</h2>

<p>De-Ba'athification offers lessons that extend far beyond Iraq.</p>

<p>First, speed kills. The pressure to act quickly, to demonstrate progress, to show that the occupation was achieving its goals—all of this pushed policymakers toward sweeping action when careful deliberation was needed. Sixty days was not enough time to plan an occupation. Weeks were not enough time to design a de-Ba'athification policy.</p>

<p>Second, expertise matters. The people who designed de-Ba'athification had spent little time in Iraq and had limited understanding of its society. The people who opposed the policy—the diplomats, the intelligence officers, the military commanders on the ground—were overruled by officials in Washington who had never walked the streets of Baghdad.</p>

<p>Third, analogies can mislead. The comparison to denazification sounded compelling in conference rooms. It provided historical legitimacy, a sense that this approach had worked before. But the circumstances were different enough that the analogy broke down completely in practice.</p>

<p>Fourth, process matters as much as policy. The breakdown in communication—the National Security Advisor not being told, the Secretary of State not being consulted, the CIA learning about the policy only after it was implemented—represents a catastrophic failure of governance. Even if de-Ba'athification had been the right policy, the process by which it was adopted virtually guaranteed poor execution.</p>

<p>Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, you cannot bomb your way to democracy. Removing Saddam Hussein was the easy part. Building something in his place required understanding Iraqi society—its fault lines, its institutions, its people—in ways that the occupation's architects never did.</p>

<h2>The Unanswerable Question</h2>

<p>Would Iraq have turned out differently without de-Ba'athification?</p>

<p>We can never know for certain. The country faced enormous challenges regardless: sectarian tensions that Saddam had suppressed but never resolved, regional powers with competing interests, an insurgency that might have emerged no matter what policies the occupation adopted.</p>

<p>But we do know this: de-Ba'athification created hundreds of thousands of enemies where there might have been grudging collaborators. It destroyed the institutional knowledge needed to keep a country running. It validated Sunni fears of persecution and Shia desires for revenge. It took the difficult challenge of post-war reconstruction and made it nearly impossible.</p>

<p>The policy was drafted by people who had never been to Iraq, approved by people who didn't know it was happening, and implemented by people who had been told it was coming from above. It represented the worst instincts of American foreign policy: the belief that grand gestures could substitute for careful understanding, that ideological conviction could overcome practical constraints, that history could be remade by force of will.</p>

<p>Iraq paid the price. It is paying still.</p>
