        I've written a comprehensive essay on Judith Curry that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about her dramatic career transformation
- Traces her journey from establishment scientist to prominent skeptic
- Explains the "neo-skeptic" position in accessible terms
- Covers her congressional testimonies and political utility
- Discusses the 2025 DOE Climate Working Group and its controversial report
- Provides context about how her story fits broader patterns in science communication
- Maintains a balanced but substantive tone throughout

The essay is approximately 2,200 words, which should provide about 12-15 minutes of listening time. I varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio flow, spelled out acronyms on first use, and explained technical concepts from first principles.
