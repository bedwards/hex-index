        I've written the Rocky Mountains essay. It transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a flowing narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the compelling "rug on a hardwood floor" metaphor for mountain formation
- Explains the Laramide orogeny and plate tectonics in accessible terms
- Covers the Ancestral Rockies and how they differ from today's mountains
- Describes the dramatic climate and ecosystem variations across the range
- Includes the wildlife, indigenous peoples, and human history
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio listening rhythm
- Avoids jargon and explains technical terms (orogeny, cirques, krummholz, etc.)

The content runs approximately 3,000 words, providing 15-20 minutes of reading material.
