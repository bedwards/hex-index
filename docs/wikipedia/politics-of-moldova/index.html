        I've written a comprehensive essay on Moldovan politics (approximately 2,700 words, ~15 minute read) that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about Moldova's paradoxes rather than a dry definition
- Explains the parliamentary system and Maia Sandu's de facto semi-presidential drift
- Tells the story of how Moldova was separated from Romania through the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest and 1940 Soviet annexation
- Explores the identity split between Moldovan and Romanian identities created by Soviet policy
- Covers the Transnistria frozen conflict in detail
- Includes Gagauzia as a contrast showing autonomy that worked
- Addresses democracy challenges, the 2014 banking scandal, and human trafficking issues
- Connects to current events including Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Sandu's 2024 re-election

The essay is formatted with semantic HTML optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading, with varied paragraph and sentence lengths. I need write permission to save the file to `docs/wikipedia/politics-of-moldova/index.html`.
