        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on behavioral economics. The article transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I did:

**Key writing choices:**
- Started with a hook (Bernoulli's puzzle) rather than a dry definition
- Used the metaphor of homo economicus as an "imaginary friend" to explain rational choice theory
- Varied paragraph lengths from punchy single sentences to longer explanatory paragraphs
- Spelled out concepts like "satisfice" (combining satisfy and suffice)
- Explained technical concepts from first principles (the Allais paradox, loss aversion, probability weighting)
- Added interesting connections (Simon's scissors metaphor, the 2008 financial crisis as System 1 failure)
- Created natural narrative flow with section transitions

**Structure:**
- ~3,500 words, approximately 20 minutes of reading time
- Clean semantic HTML matching the project's existing Wikipedia article format
- Proper heading hierarchy (h2 for main sections)
- Lists used sparingly and appropriately
- Source credit at the top
