        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on colocation centres. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The windowless building with its cooling units and blinking servers, rather than a dry definition
2. **Uses the "carrier hotel" metaphor** throughout to make the concept accessible
3. **Explains from first principles** - Why companies would need this, how the economics work
4. **Varies paragraph length** - From single punchy sentences ("Time for the diesel generators to start.") to longer explanatory paragraphs
5. **Spells out acronyms** - SSAE 16, HIPAA, etc. are all written out
6. **Adds interesting connections** - The 19-inch rack standard dating to the telegraph era, the NAP of the Americas handling Latin American traffic
7. **Flows naturally** - Uses transitions and narrative structure rather than bullet points
8. **Ends with a reflection** - Connecting the reader to these invisible buildings they pass without noticing

The content is ready to write once file permissions are granted. The HTML includes semantic markup optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.
