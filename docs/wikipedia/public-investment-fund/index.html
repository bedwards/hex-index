        The HTML content has been generated. Here's the rewritten Wikipedia article about the Public Investment Fund, transformed into an engaging essay format optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading:

---

**Summary of the rewritten article:**

The essay opens with a compelling hook about Jared Kushner receiving $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund shortly after leaving the White House—immediately grabbing attention and establishing the personal stakes.

It then builds understanding from first principles:
- Explains what sovereign wealth funds are and why countries create them
- Traces the PIF's transformation from a sleepy bureaucracy with 50 employees to a global powerhouse with 500+
- Details MBS's takeover and Vision 2030 ambitions

The piece covers the fund's major investments and controversies:
- The SoftBank Vision Fund disaster (WeWork, Uber losses)
- Ambitious domestic projects (Neom, Qiddiya, Red Sea Project)
- The Newcastle United acquisition and sportswashing accusations
- The LIV Golf saga, including damning quotes from players about Khashoggi
- Kushner and Mnuchin investments after leaving government

Throughout, I've:
- Varied paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Spelled out acronyms on first use (PIF, MBS, ESG)
- Added context and connections the Wikipedia article lacked
- Maintained narrative flow rather than encyclopedic structure
- Kept the content substantive (~2,800 words, roughly 15-20 minutes of reading)

The essay ends with reflection on the bigger picture—energy transition, geopolitical competition, and the moral questions that follow the fund wherever it goes.
