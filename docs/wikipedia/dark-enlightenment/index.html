        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about questioning Enlightenment values rather than a dry definition
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms (NRx as "neoreaction," DOGE as "Department of Government Efficiency")
- Explains concepts like "the Cathedral," "the Patchwork," and "gov-corps" from first principles
- Draws connections between Silicon Valley culture and neoreactionary appeal
- Maintains narrative flow through transitions rather than encyclopedia-style sections
- Covers the key figures (Yarvin, Land, Thiel, Vance) and their relationships
- Addresses both the ideas themselves and their real-world political influence
- Provides critical perspectives without being preachy

The content runs approximately 4,000 words, which should provide 20-25 minutes of reading time—substantive but not exhausting.
