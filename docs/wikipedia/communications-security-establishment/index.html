<p>Six billion attacks. Every single day.</p>

<p>That's what Canada's cyber defense systems reportedly blocked in 2024—a staggering 2.3 trillion malicious actions over the course of a year. Behind this digital shield stands an organization that most Canadians have never heard of, one that spent its first three decades operating in such complete secrecy that even members of Parliament didn't know it existed.</p>

<p>The Communications Security Establishment, or CSE, is Canada's national cryptologic intelligence agency. Think of it as Canada's equivalent to America's National Security Agency or Britain's Government Communications Headquarters. Its job is twofold: break the codes of foreign adversaries to gather intelligence, and protect Canadian government communications from being broken by others. Code-makers and code-breakers, working in the shadows.</p>

<h2>Born in Wartime Secrecy</h2>

<p>The story begins in June 1941, with a small unit called the Examination Unit, tucked away as a branch of Canada's National Research Council. The Second World War was raging, and Canada needed to intercept and decode enemy communications.</p>

<p>The unit's first targets were Vichy France—the collaborationist French government working with Nazi Germany—and Germany itself. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and entered the war, the unit's mandate expanded to include cracking Imperial Japanese communications as well.</p>

<p>At any given time, only about fifty people worked there. Seventy-seven in total passed through its doors during the war years. This tiny group operated out of Laurier House in Sandy Hill, a quiet Ottawa neighborhood chosen specifically because it wouldn't attract suspicion.</p>

<p>By September 1945, the war was over. But the intelligence apparatus didn't simply pack up and go home.</p>

<p>U.S. President Harry Truman declared that peacetime would still require such operations. Canadian authorities reached the same conclusion by December. The wartime emergency had revealed something important: in the modern world, signals intelligence—the interception and analysis of communications—wasn't just a wartime necessity. It was a permanent requirement.</p>

<h2>The Agency That Didn't Exist</h2>

<p>On April 13, 1946, a secret Order in Council created the Communications Branch of the National Research Council, or CBNRC. This was Canada's first peacetime cryptologic agency. The word "secret" here isn't metaphorical—the agency's very existence was classified.</p>

<p>For thirty-four years, CBNRC operated in total obscurity. It combined the civilian Examination Unit with a military signals intelligence group called the Joint Discrimination Unit. Under its first director, Edward Drake, the new agency worked with intercepted foreign communications collected from a Royal Canadian Signal Corps station at Rockcliffe Airport in Ottawa.</p>

<p>They also worked with Canadian Forces Station Leitrim, just south of Ottawa. This station, established in 1941, is Canada's oldest continuously operating signals intelligence collection facility. In 1946, it had a staff of just 75 people. By 2013, that number had swelled to around 2,000.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, the agency's primary focus shifted to the Soviet Union. Its main client was the Department of National Defence, hungry for intelligence on Soviet military operations. The agency also began domestic communications security work on January 1, 1947—protecting Canadian government communications, not just intercepting foreign ones.</p>

<p>Throughout this period, the Canadian public had no idea any of this existed.</p>

<h2>The Secret Breaks</h2>

<p>On January 9, 1974, the CBC television program The Fifth Estate aired a documentary called "The Espionage Establishment." For the first time ever, CBNRC was mentioned publicly. The response was immediate: an outcry in the House of Commons and, finally, an admission from the Canadian government that yes, this organization was real.</p>

<p>The following year, 1975, brought reorganization. CBNRC was transferred from the National Research Council to the Department of National Defence by another Order in Council. It received a new name: the Communications Security Establishment. CSE was now public knowledge, though its operations remained deeply classified.</p>

<p>The agency had evolved considerably since its Cold War origins. It was no longer solely focused on Soviet military communications. It had diversified, becoming Canada's primary signals intelligence resource across a wide range of political, defense, and security matters.</p>

<h2>The Codebreaking Arms Race</h2>

<p>Here's a fascinating detail that reveals the technological stakes involved: CSE's codebreaking capabilities actually degraded substantially during the 1960s and 1970s. Cryptography was advancing faster than the agency's ability to crack it.</p>

<p>The solution arrived in March 1985, in the form of a Cray X-MP/11 supercomputer, delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley building in Ottawa. At the time, it was the most powerful computer in Canada. Modern cryptography is fundamentally a computational race—whoever has more processing power has an advantage. A cipher that might take centuries to break by hand can potentially be cracked in hours or days with sufficient computing power.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, CSE purchased a Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer for just over 1.6 million Canadian dollars. When Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991, the machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver. Intriguingly, this system ran something called the Folklore Operating System—supplied by the National Security Agency in the United States.</p>

<p>What computers does CSE use today? That's classified. But Cray has continued producing increasingly powerful supercomputers: the SX-6 in the early 2000s, the X1 in 2003 (whose development was partially funded by the NSA), the XD1 in 2004, and several others since. It's reasonable to assume CSE has kept pace.</p>

<h2>The Five Eyes Partnership</h2>

<p>Canada doesn't operate alone in the signals intelligence world. CSE works within the Five Eyes alliance—a partnership with the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand that dates back to the post-World War II era.</p>

<p>The arrangement is elegant in its logic: rather than each country duplicating effort by trying to monitor everything themselves, the five allies divide the collection burden and share what they find. Canada, with its northern geography stretching across the top of North America, occupies a strategically valuable position for monitoring certain communications. The intelligence yield from this collaborative effort far exceeds what any single nation could achieve independently.</p>

<p>Canada is described as a "substantial beneficiary and participant" in this arrangement—contributing meaningfully while also gaining access to intelligence it could never collect on its own.</p>

<h2>After September 11</h2>

<p>The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, transformed Western intelligence agencies. Canada was no exception.</p>

<p>In December 2001, Canada's Anti-terrorism Act received royal assent. Among its many provisions, the act amended the National Defence Act to formally acknowledge and mandate CSE's activities. For the first time, the agency's existence and basic functions were written into statute rather than secret orders. The act also amended the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, the Criminal Code, and the Official Secrets Act (later renamed the Security of Information Act).</p>

<p>This was a philosophical shift as much as a legal one. During the Cold War, the primary intelligence concern was a known adversary—the Soviet Union—with conventional military forces. The post-9/11 era brought focus on transnational threats: terrorism, cyber criminals, hostile non-state actors. The intelligence priorities of the Canadian government expanded accordingly.</p>

<p>In November 2011, CSE became a standalone agency, no longer embedded within the Department of National Defence's bureaucratic structure (though still under the National Defence portfolio). In June 2019, the Communications Security Establishment Act was passed as part of an omnibus national security bill, formally setting out the agency's mandate and powers in comprehensive legislation.</p>

<h2>What CSE Actually Does Today</h2>

<p>The modern Communications Security Establishment has five core functions, spelled out in its enabling legislation.</p>

<p>First, foreign signals intelligence. This is the code-breaking heritage—intercepting and analyzing foreign communications to produce intelligence for Canadian government decision-makers. The targets range from foreign governments to terrorist organizations to transnational criminal networks.</p>

<p>Second, cyber operations. This is the newer, more active side of the mission. CSE is authorized to conduct both defensive and active cyber operations. Defensive operations mean protecting Canadian systems from foreign cyber attacks—if a hostile actor tries to steal information from a government network, CSE can take action to stop them, potentially by disabling the attacker's own infrastructure. Active operations mean taking pre-emptive action against threats: disrupting terrorist communications, degrading criminal networks, or countering hostile intelligence operations before they succeed.</p>

<p>Third, cyber security and information assurance. Through its Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, established in October 2018, CSE serves as the government's authority for protecting critical infrastructure. This includes monitoring threats, coordinating incident response, and defending systems that the Minister of National Defence has designated as nationally important—energy grids, telecommunications networks, healthcare databases, banking systems, even elections infrastructure.</p>

<p>Fourth, technical and operational assistance to other agencies. CSE provides support to the military, to federal law enforcement like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and to other security agencies including the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority. This assistance can include collecting and processing communications, providing technical solutions, offering linguistic support, and conducting operations under the requesting agency's legal authority.</p>

<p>This last point is subtle but important: when CSE assists another agency, it operates under that agency's legal restrictions. If the RCMP has a court-issued warrant to surveil a Canadian citizen, CSE can provide technical assistance for that surveillance. The agency itself doesn't have independent authority to target Canadians, but it can assist partners who do.</p>

<p>Fifth, research. CSE maintains specialized research units including the Vulnerability Research Centre, which studies computer security weaknesses, and the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing, named after the brilliant cryptanalyst William Tutte who broke the Nazi "Tunny" cipher during World War II. The institute conducts both classified and unclassified research in cryptology and knowledge discovery.</p>

<h2>The Human Scale</h2>

<p>In August 2021, when the Taliban retook Afghanistan and Canadians needed to be evacuated from Kabul, CSE's foreign signals intelligence played a role in assisting Global Affairs Canada and the Canadian Armed Forces with the airlift operation. Intelligence isn't abstract—it has human consequences.</p>

<p>The agency faces very concrete challenges too. In October 2023, CSE Chief Caroline Xavier told CBC News that the agency was considering opening offices in various Canadian cities to help address staffing shortages. Even spy agencies have recruiting problems.</p>

<p>Xavier, who became Chief on August 31, 2022, is accountable to the Minister of National Defence, who in turn answers to Cabinet and Parliament. Oversight of CSE's activities is handled by the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency, created in 2019 as part of the same omnibus legislation that established CSE's current mandate.</p>

<h2>The Scale of the Threat</h2>

<p>Return for a moment to those numbers from the beginning: 2.3 trillion malicious actions blocked in a single year. Six billion per day, on average.</p>

<p>What does "malicious action" mean? It's a broad category encompassing everything from crude automated attacks—bots probing for known vulnerabilities—to sophisticated state-sponsored intrusions. The sheer volume reflects the reality of modern cyber conflict: attacks are constant, automated, and relentless. The digital infrastructure that modern society depends on is under perpetual siege.</p>

<p>The Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, CSE's public-facing cyber defense arm, uses automated defense systems to handle this volume. No human team could manually review billions of daily incidents. The systems must make instantaneous decisions about what constitutes a threat and how to respond.</p>

<p>This represents a fundamental shift in what intelligence and security mean. During the Cold War, intelligence work centered on human spies and physical intercept stations, with analysts poring over decoded messages. Today, it's increasingly about algorithms, automated systems, and the raw computational power to process inconceivable quantities of data.</p>

<h2>From Laurier House to Six Billion Attacks</h2>

<p>There's something almost quaint about the Examination Unit's origins—fifty people in a house in Sandy Hill, chosen because it wouldn't attract suspicion, decoding messages from Vichy France. The seventy-seven people who passed through that unit during the war could hardly have imagined an agency defending against six billion attacks per day.</p>

<p>Yet the core mission hasn't changed. Protect communications. Understand what adversaries are saying. Stay one step ahead.</p>

<p>The Communications Security Establishment spent its first thirty-four years in such complete secrecy that its existence was never publicly acknowledged. Today, it maintains a public website, publishes annual reports, and its chief gives interviews to the CBC. The agency has emerged from the shadows, at least partially.</p>

<p>But some things remain constant. The best cryptanalysts still work problems that can't be discussed publicly. The most sensitive capabilities remain classified. And somewhere in Ottawa, computers vastly more powerful than that first Cray are working on codes that the public will never know about.</p>

<p>Canada's code-makers and code-breakers continue their work, as they have since 1941. The adversaries change—Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, the Soviet Union, terrorist networks, hostile cyber actors—but the mission endures. Protect the communications that matter. Break the ones that threaten.</p>

<p>Six billion times a day, every day, the digital walls hold.</p>
