<h2>The Ghost That Won't Leave Peru</h2>

<p>In December 2022, Peru's president tried to dissolve congress and rule by decree. Within hours, he was arrested, impeached, and replaced by his vice president. The coup attempt lasted about two hours. But here's what makes it strange: the people who orchestrated his removal, who had spent years making his presidency impossible, who controlled the congress he tried to dissolve—they were followers of a man who had been sitting in prison for over a decade.</p>

<p>That man was Alberto Fujimori. And the political movement built around him, his policies, and eventually his children, is called Fujimorism.</p>

<p>It's one of the most unusual political phenomena in Latin America. Most personality cults die when their leader falls from power. Fujimorism has somehow grown stronger.</p>

<h2>The Original Fujimori</h2>

<p>Alberto Fujimori was an agricultural engineer and university rector with no political experience when he won Peru's presidency in 1990. He was the son of Japanese immigrants, which made him an extreme outsider in a country where politics had always been dominated by people of European descent. His campaign slogan was simple: "Honesty, Technology, and Work."</p>

<p>Peru in 1990 was falling apart. Inflation had reached over 7,000 percent. Two terrorist organizations—Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement—were waging brutal insurgencies. Car bombs exploded in Lima. Assassinations were routine. The traditional political parties seemed incapable of addressing any of it.</p>

<p>Fujimori promised to be different. And he was—though not in the ways anyone expected.</p>

<p>Within two years of taking office, he did something extraordinary. On April 5, 1992, he went on television and announced that he was dissolving congress, suspending the constitution, and taking direct control of the judiciary. Tanks surrounded the congressional building. It was, by any definition, a coup. The unusual part was that Fujimori was staging a coup against his own government.</p>

<p>This is what political scientists call an "autogolpe" or self-coup—when an elected leader seizes dictatorial powers. It's rarer than you might think. Most coups come from the military or political opponents. Fujimori essentially promoted himself from president to dictator.</p>

<h2>The Terrorism Justification</h2>

<p>Fujimori's stated reason for the self-coup was terrorism. He argued that Peru's democratic institutions were too weak, too corrupt, and too infiltrated by terrorist sympathizers to effectively fight Shining Path. Only by concentrating power could he save the country.</p>

<p>There was just enough truth in this to make it persuasive. Shining Path really was terrifying. They had murdered tens of thousands of people. They assassinated local officials, bombed power stations, and controlled significant rural territory. Many Peruvians were genuinely desperate for someone to stop them.</p>

<p>And Fujimori did stop them—or at least his security forces did. In September 1992, just five months after the self-coup, police captured Abimael Guzmán, the leader of Shining Path. The movement never recovered. By the mid-1990s, the insurgency that had threatened to tear Peru apart was effectively defeated.</p>

<p>This success became the foundation of Fujimori's cult of personality. He presented himself as the man who had saved Peru when democracy couldn't.</p>

<h2>The Terruqueo</h2>

<p>But Fujimori didn't just fight actual terrorists. He weaponized the concept of terrorism itself.</p>

<p>After the 1992 crisis, his government dramatically broadened the legal definition of terrorism. Actions that had nothing to do with Shining Path or armed insurgency could now be prosecuted as terrorist acts. This gave the government enormous power to persecute anyone it considered an enemy—particularly people on the political left.</p>

<p>This tactic has a name in Peru: terruqueo. It comes from combining "terrorista" (terrorist) with a suffix that implies accusation. Terruqueo means accusing your political opponents of being terrorists, or terrorist sympathizers, or somehow connected to terrorism—regardless of whether there's any evidence.</p>

<p>It's a fearmongering technique, and it proved devastatingly effective. In a country traumatized by genuine terrorism, the accusation alone was enough to destroy someone's reputation and political career. It didn't matter if the person had ever had any connection to Shining Path. The association was poison.</p>

<p>Fujimori used terruqueo to make left-wing politics essentially impossible in Peru for a generation. Anyone who advocated for workers' rights, land reform, indigenous rights, or wealth redistribution could be painted as a terrorist sympathizer. The legacy of political violence became a weapon against anyone who challenged the status quo.</p>

<p>Political scientist Daniel Encinas has documented how terruqueo evolved over time. What started as accusations of literal terrorism gradually became a way to attack anyone who opposed neoliberal economic policies. Don't like privatization? You must be a communist. Don't like foreign mining companies? You must support terrorism. The right wing, Encinas argues, used this as "a strategy of manipulating the legacy of political violence."</p>

<h2>The 1993 Constitution</h2>

<p>After his self-coup, Fujimori needed to legitimize his new order. He did this by writing a new constitution.</p>

<p>The 1993 Constitution of Peru replaced the previous 1979 constitution and remains in effect today. It was drafted by a constituent assembly dominated by Fujimori's supporters after he had already seized power and dissolved the previous congress. Critics argue it was designed from the start to entrench Fujimori's political and economic program.</p>

<p>The constitution enshrined neoliberal economic principles—privatization, free markets, foreign investment protection—as constitutional rights. It made it much harder for future governments to reverse Fujimori's economic reforms. It also restructured Peru's political institutions in ways that would later prove convenient for Fujimori's family.</p>

<p>This is one of the most important aspects of Fujimorism that often gets overlooked. It's not just a personality cult or a set of policy preferences. It's embedded in Peru's constitutional structure. Challenging Fujimorism means challenging the basic legal framework of the Peruvian state.</p>

<h2>Neoliberalism and Extractivism</h2>

<p>Fujimorism has a specific economic ideology, even if Fujimori himself wasn't particularly ideological.</p>

<p>The term "neoliberalism" gets thrown around a lot, so let's be precise about what it means in this context. Neoliberal economics emphasizes privatization of state-owned enterprises, deregulation of markets, reduction of government spending on social programs, and openness to foreign investment and trade. The idea is that free markets, rather than government planning, should allocate resources.</p>

<p>Fujimori implemented this agenda aggressively. He privatized state-owned companies in telecommunications, electricity, and mining. He signed contracts with transnational corporations to develop Peru's natural resources. He reduced the government's role in providing services.</p>

<p>This connects to extractivism—an economic model based on extracting natural resources (mining, oil, timber) for export. Peru has enormous mineral wealth, including copper, gold, silver, and zinc. Under Fujimori's reforms, foreign mining companies gained favorable terms to develop these resources.</p>

<p>The economic results were mixed. Inflation was tamed. Economic growth returned. But inequality remained severe, and the benefits of growth were concentrated among elites. Rural and indigenous communities, whose lands often contained the minerals that mining companies wanted, saw few benefits and bore most of the environmental and social costs.</p>

<p>This economic model has proven remarkably durable. Thirty years later, Peru's economy still operates largely according to the framework Fujimori established. Subsequent governments, regardless of their rhetoric, have mostly maintained these policies.</p>

<h2>The Human Rights Crimes</h2>

<p>While Fujimori was defeating terrorism and implementing economic reforms, his security forces were committing atrocities.</p>

<p>The most notorious was a death squad called Grupo Colina. Operating under the direction of Fujimori's intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos, Grupo Colina carried out extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, and forced disappearances. Their victims included suspected terrorists, but also journalists, students, and others who had no connection to armed groups.</p>

<p>Two massacres became particularly infamous. In November 1991, Grupo Colina killed fifteen people, including an eight-year-old boy, at a barbecue in the Lima neighborhood of Barrios Altos. The victims were suspected of being Shining Path members. They weren't. In July 1992, the group kidnapped nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University, tortured and killed them, and buried their bodies in clandestine graves. Again, the supposed terrorist connection was fabricated.</p>

<p>These weren't rogue operations. Evidence would later establish that Fujimori personally authorized Grupo Colina's activities.</p>

<h2>The Fall</h2>

<p>Fujimori's downfall came in 2000, and it was almost comically sordid.</p>

<p>Vladimiro Montesinos, his intelligence chief and the man who had run Grupo Colina, turned out to have been videotaping his own corruption for years. When one of these videos leaked—showing Montesinos bribing a congressman—the whole rotten system was suddenly visible.</p>

<p>Fujimori was in Japan when the scandal broke. Rather than return to face the music, he faxed his resignation to congress. Congress refused to accept it, preferring to remove him by impeachment so he couldn't claim he had left voluntarily.</p>

<p>Fujimori stayed in Japan for five years. He held Japanese citizenship through his parents, and Japan doesn't extradite its citizens. He seemed to believe he could simply wait out the storm and eventually return to politics.</p>

<p>In 2005, he made an inexplicable decision. He flew to Chile—apparently believing he could use it as a stepping stone back to Peru. Chilean authorities arrested him. After a lengthy extradition battle, he was sent back to Peru in 2007.</p>

<p>The trials that followed were landmark events in international human rights law. In 2009, Fujimori was convicted of ordering the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta massacres and sentenced to 25 years in prison. It was the first time a democratically elected head of state had been convicted in his own country for human rights abuses.</p>

<h2>The Children</h2>

<p>This is where the story gets strange. In most countries, a leader convicted of ordering death squad massacres would be politically finished. His movement would collapse. His name would become toxic.</p>

<p>Not in Peru.</p>

<p>Alberto Fujimori has four children. Two of them—Keiko and Kenji—entered politics. Keiko, the eldest daughter, founded a political party called Fuerza Popular, or Popular Force, in 2010. Her explicit mission was to continue her father's legacy.</p>

<p>Keiko first ran for president in 2011. She came in second. She ran again in 2016. She came in second again—but this time, Popular Force won a commanding majority in congress. She ran a third time in 2021. She came in second once more.</p>

<p>Three presidential campaigns, three losses. But through her control of congress, Keiko Fujimori has arguably wielded more power than any Peruvian president of the past decade.</p>

<h2>The Constitutional Weapon</h2>

<p>Here's where the 1993 constitution becomes crucial. Under that constitution—the one written by Keiko's father—congress has enormous power relative to the presidency. It can easily initiate impeachment proceedings. It can block presidential initiatives. It can make governing essentially impossible.</p>

<p>This is exactly what Popular Force did after 2016. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a center-right economist, won the presidency. He had no connection to the political left. He was a former World Bank official and finance minister who supported free-market policies. By any normal measure, he should have been an acceptable president to conservatives.</p>

<p>But he had beaten Keiko. That was enough.</p>

<p>Within months of taking office, the Fujimorist congress began impeachment proceedings against Kuczynski. The first attempt, in December 2017, failed by a narrow margin. Just before the second attempt in March 2018, something remarkable happened.</p>

<p>Kenji Fujimori, Keiko's younger brother, was caught on video attempting to buy congressional votes to save President Kuczynski from impeachment. The scandal—dubbed the "Kenjivideos"—destroyed Kenji's political career and led to his expulsion from Popular Force. But it also forced Kuczynski to resign.</p>

<p>The whole situation had the feel of a family melodrama playing out on a national stage. Keiko and Kenji were at war with each other. Their father sat in prison. And Peru's government lurched from crisis to crisis.</p>

<h2>Pardons and Reversals</h2>

<p>Between the two impeachment votes, Kuczynski did something that shocked many Peruvians. He pardoned Alberto Fujimori.</p>

<p>The official justification was humanitarian. Fujimori was 79 years old and in poor health. But the timing—just days after Kuczynski narrowly survived the first impeachment vote, with help from Kenji Fujimori's faction—made it look like a quid pro quo.</p>

<p>The pardon didn't last. In October 2018, a Peruvian court overturned it. Alberto Fujimori went back to prison in January 2019.</p>

<p>The same month the pardon was overturned, Keiko Fujimori was detained as part of an investigation into the Odebrecht scandal—a massive bribery scheme involving the Brazilian construction company that touched governments across Latin America. Prosecutors alleged that Odebrecht had illegally funded Keiko's 2011 presidential campaign.</p>

<h2>The Obstructionists</h2>

<p>Despite these legal troubles, Popular Force maintained its congressional majority. And it used that majority in ways that earned it a specific reputation.</p>

<p>The Associated Press described Fujimorists as "hardline obstructionists for blocking initiatives popular with Peruvians aimed at curbing the nation's rampant corruption." They blocked anti-corruption reforms. They blocked investigations. In one particularly notable case in 2017, Popular Force used its majority to shut down an investigation into alleged sexual abuse within the Catholic Church, claiming it was an attack on religion.</p>

<p>Martín Vizcarra, the vice president who replaced Kuczynski, tried to push through reforms. He proposed a referendum on anti-corruption measures and changes to how judges and congressmen were selected. The Fujimorist congress resisted at every turn.</p>

<p>Eventually, in September 2019, Vizcarra dissolved congress—using a constitutional provision that allows the president to do so if congress refuses to grant a vote of confidence to two successive cabinets. It was constitutionally legal, but the Fujimorists called it a coup.</p>

<p>New congressional elections were held in January 2020. Popular Force lost its majority. But by then, the damage to Peru's institutions was extensive.</p>

<h2>The 2021 Election</h2>

<p>Keiko Fujimori's third presidential campaign, in 2021, revealed how deeply embedded the terruqueo had become in Peruvian politics.</p>

<p>Her opponent in the runoff was Pedro Castillo, a rural schoolteacher and union leader from Peru's impoverished interior. Castillo ran on a left-wing platform calling for a new constitution, nationalization of mining revenues, and increased social spending. He represented everything Fujimorism opposed.</p>

<p>The campaign became extraordinarily ugly. Major media organizations, business groups, and much of Lima's elite rallied behind Keiko. El Comercio, one of the largest newspapers in South America, openly backed her. The terruqueo was deployed at full force—Castillo was painted as a communist, a terrorist sympathizer, someone who would turn Peru into Venezuela.</p>

<p>Reuters and other international observers documented how Peruvian media spread misinformation about Castillo, using fear and fake news to support Fujimori. It didn't work. Castillo won by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>But Fujimorists in congress, though now a minority, immediately began working to make his presidency impossible. They blocked his cabinet appointments. They initiated impeachment proceedings. They manipulated legislative procedures to consolidate power within the legislature.</p>

<p>In December 2022, facing yet another impeachment vote he was certain to lose, Castillo attempted his own self-coup. He went on television and announced he was dissolving congress and establishing an emergency government. It was a desperate, incompetent move. Within hours, his own cabinet abandoned him. He was arrested while trying to reach the Mexican embassy. His vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in as president.</p>

<p>The Fujimorists had won—not by winning an election, but by making it impossible for their opponent to govern.</p>

<h2>The Ideology</h2>

<p>What exactly is Fujimorism? It's tempting to see it as purely a personality cult, but it has a coherent ideological core.</p>

<p>Economically, it's neoliberal. Privatization, free markets, foreign investment, minimal state intervention. These principles are now embedded in Peru's constitution and defended as sacrosanct.</p>

<p>Politically, it's authoritarian. Decision-making is centralized and secretive. Democratic institutions are tools to be captured, not independent checks on power. The 1992 self-coup established the template: when democracy gets in the way, circumvent it.</p>

<p>Socially, it's conservative. Fujimorism opposes LGBTQ rights, opposes sex education in schools, opposes what it calls "gender ideology." It has close ties to conservative Catholic organizations.</p>

<p>And it's defined by what it opposes: communism, the left, anything that challenges the economic status quo. The terruqueo keeps these enemies always present in Peruvian politics, a specter to be invoked whenever anyone questions neoliberal policies or demands redistribution.</p>

<p>The Peruvian sociologist Aníbal Quijano described Fujimorism as having "fascistic traits." He was careful to distinguish it from classical fascism—it lacks the nationalist mythology, the mass mobilization, the theatrical pageantry. But the authoritarianism, the anti-communism, the alliance with economic elites, the willingness to use violence—these elements are recognizable.</p>

<h2>The Network</h2>

<p>Fujimorism isn't just Popular Force. Over the years, it has spawned or allied with numerous political parties and movements.</p>

<p>Alberto Fujimori's original parties were Cambio 90 (Change 90) and New Majority. After his fall, there was Sí Cumple, then Peru 2000, then Alliance for the Future. Popular Force emerged in 2010 as the main vehicle. Another Fujimorist party, Peru Secure Homeland, was founded in 2013.</p>

<p>In recent years, Fujimorists have allied with other right-wing forces. Popular Renewal, led by Rafael López Aliaga, a conservative Catholic businessman, has become a close partner. So has Advance Country, led by Hernando de Soto, a libertarian economist famous for his theories about property rights and development.</p>

<p>These parties signed something called the Madrid Charter in 2020, an anti-leftist manifesto promoted by Vox, the Spanish far-right party. The charter commits signatories to fighting "communism," "gender ideology," and what it calls the "Puebla Group"—a network of leftist Latin American politicians. It's part of a broader international alliance of right-wing parties that share talking points, strategies, and a common set of enemies.</p>

<p>There are also darker elements. A group called La Resistencia Dios, Patria y Familia (The Resistance: God, Fatherland, and Family) has been described by analysts as "neo-fascist." It organizes protests in support of Fujimorist causes and has links to Popular Renewal. These are the street-level enforcers, the people who show up to intimidate journalists and opposition politicians.</p>

<h2>The Paradox</h2>

<p>Here's what makes Fujimorism so difficult to understand from the outside: Alberto Fujimori was convicted of ordering murders. He's not accused, not suspected—convicted. In 2009, Peru's Supreme Court found that he personally authorized death squad killings. This is a matter of legal record.</p>

<p>And yet his daughter has come within a few percentage points of winning the presidency three times. His movement controls much of Peru's political system. His constitution still governs the country. When he was released from prison on humanitarian grounds in late 2023 (another pardon, another court battle), thousands of supporters celebrated.</p>

<p>How is this possible?</p>

<p>Part of the answer is the genuine trauma of the Shining Path years. Fujimori really did end that nightmare. For many Peruvians, especially those who lived through the worst of it, the death squads were a price worth paying. They distinguish between Fujimori's crimes—which they acknowledge—and his achievements, which they consider more important.</p>

<p>Part of the answer is the weakness of Peru's political institutions. The country has never developed stable political parties. Most Peruvian parties are vehicles for individual politicians, rising and falling with their founders. In this environment, a durable political family like the Fujimoris has structural advantages.</p>

<p>Part of the answer is the economy. Fujimori's reforms created winners as well as losers. The business elite, the professional classes, people who benefited from privatization and foreign investment—they have material reasons to support the system he created.</p>

<p>And part of the answer is the terruqueo. By making left-wing politics synonymous with terrorism, Fujimorism has restricted the range of acceptable political debate. Alternatives are discredited before they can be articulated. Fear does the work of persuasion.</p>

<h2>The Constitutional Question</h2>

<p>The 1993 constitution remains at the center of Peru's political conflicts. Many of the presidents who have been impeached or forced from office—Kuczynski, Vizcarra, Castillo—campaigned on replacing or substantially reforming it. None succeeded.</p>

<p>Defenders of the constitution argue that it has provided stability and economic growth. Critics argue that it entrenches inequality, favors extractive industries over communities, and creates a political system designed for gridlock and obstruction. Both are right.</p>

<p>What's clear is that the constitution serves Fujimorist interests. It protects the economic model they established. It gives congress—which they have repeatedly controlled—disproportionate power over the presidency. It makes constitutional reform extremely difficult.</p>

<p>This is the deepest level at which Fujimorism operates. It's not just a political movement or an ideology. It's a constitutional order. Even when Fujimorists lose elections, they maintain influence through structures their founder created.</p>

<h2>The Present Moment</h2>

<p>As of late 2024, Peru remains politically unstable. Dina Boluarte, who became president after Castillo's removal, has faced massive protests, particularly from rural and indigenous communities who see her as a creature of the Lima elite. Her approval ratings have been dismal. But impeachment requires a two-thirds vote, and the fractured congress hasn't been able to muster it.</p>

<p>Fujimorists remain influential in congress, though no longer dominant. Alberto Fujimori, after his latest release from prison, began talking about running for president again in 2026—at age 86—before dying in September 2024. Keiko will likely run again. The movement shows no signs of disappearing.</p>

<p>The deeper question is whether Peru can ever escape the constitutional and political framework that Fujimori created. Every attempt to change it has been blocked, subverted, or abandoned. The 1993 constitution was written by an authoritarian government after a self-coup. Thirty years later, it still governs one of South America's largest countries.</p>

<p>That's the remarkable thing about Fujimorism. Alberto Fujimori governed for ten years, spent over fifteen years in prison or exile, and died a convicted human rights violator. But his system endures. The ghost won't leave Peru.</p>
