<h2>The Economist Who Thinks You're Voting Wrong</h2>

<p>Bryan Caplan has built a career on telling people uncomfortable truths they don't want to hear. Voters are systematically irrational. Parents try too hard. Schools waste your time and money. Immigration restrictions are morally indefensible. He's not trying to win popularity contests—he's trying to change your mind, one provocative argument at a time.</p>

<p>Born in 1971 in Northridge, California, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother, Caplan followed a conventional academic path that led to unconventional conclusions. He earned his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, then completed his doctorate at Princeton. Today he's a professor at George Mason University, a research fellow at the Mercatus Center, and an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute. He describes himself as an "economic libertarian," though that label barely captures the full scope of his heterodox thinking.</p>

<p>What makes Caplan interesting isn't just his conclusions—it's his willingness to follow economic logic wherever it leads, even when it puts him at odds with virtually everyone.</p>

<h2>Democracy's Uncomfortable Problem</h2>

<p>Caplan's most influential work tackles a question that strikes at the heart of democratic theory: Why do democracies so often choose bad policies?</p>

<p>The traditional economic answer was simple: voters are "rationally ignorant." Because your single vote almost never determines an election's outcome, it makes sense to spend your time on things other than studying policy details. You're not stupid—you're just rationally allocating your attention to things that actually affect your life.</p>

<p>Caplan thought this explanation was too generous.</p>

<p>In his 2007 book <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter</em>, he introduced a concept called "rational irrationality." The idea works like this: believing false things usually has costs. If you believe you can fly, you'll quickly discover the error. But in the voting booth, false beliefs are essentially free. Your vote won't change the outcome, so you can indulge whatever beliefs feel good without paying any price.</p>

<p>This creates a troubling dynamic. People don't just lack information—they actively embrace systematic biases that feel emotionally satisfying. Caplan identified several such biases by comparing surveys of economists with surveys of the general public. On issue after issue—trade, immigration, the role of profit, the nature of economic progress—ordinary voters held beliefs that economists across the political spectrum considered mistaken.</p>

<p>Take anti-foreign bias. Economists overwhelmingly agree that international trade creates net benefits for participating countries. Yet voters consistently overestimate the harms of imports and foreign workers. The belief that "they're taking our jobs" feels intuitively right, even though the economic evidence points elsewhere.</p>

<p>Or consider anti-market bias—the tendency to underestimate the benefits of market mechanisms. People assume that without government intervention, businesses would charge infinite prices and pay workers nothing. Economists understand that competition constrains such behavior more effectively than most regulations do.</p>

<p>The controversial implication: democratic dysfunction isn't primarily about money in politics, media manipulation, or voter suppression. It's about voters themselves holding beliefs that lead to bad outcomes. The problem isn't that elites thwart the popular will—it's that the popular will, on many economic questions, is simply mistaken.</p>

<p>The book provoked strong reactions. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, and <em>The New Yorker</em> all reviewed it. Academic journals debated its claims. Critics accused Caplan of elitism, of dismissing legitimate concerns as mere ignorance. Supporters found his argument uncomfortably persuasive.</p>

<h2>The Ideological Turing Test</h2>

<p>In 2011, Caplan coined a term that has since spread beyond academic circles: the "ideological Turing test."</p>

<p>The original Turing test, proposed by computer scientist Alan Turing in 1950, asks whether a machine can fool a human judge into thinking it's a person. Caplan adapted this idea to political debates. Can a liberal accurately state conservative arguments well enough to fool conservatives? Can a conservative do the reverse?</p>

<p>He was responding to economist Paul Krugman's claim that political liberals understand conservative positions better than conservatives understand liberal ones. Caplan proposed a way to actually test this: have people write essays arguing for positions they disagree with, then see if ideological opponents can tell the difference.</p>

<p>The concept caught on. Today, saying someone "can pass the ideological Turing test" has become shorthand for praising their intellectual fairness—their ability to genuinely understand rather than caricature opposing views. Saying someone "can't pass" suggests they're arguing against a strawman rather than engaging real arguments.</p>

<p>The test embodies one of Caplan's core intellectual commitments: if you can't state your opponent's position in terms they'd accept, you probably don't understand it well enough to criticize it effectively.</p>

<h2>Relax About Your Kids</h2>

<p>Parenting produces anxiety. Modern parents agonize over every decision—organic versus conventional food, screen time limits, the right schools, the ideal mix of structured activities and free play. Caplan looked at this frenzy and saw an economic problem: people are massively overinvesting in each child while underinvesting in having children at all.</p>

<p>His 2011 book <em>Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids</em> makes an argument grounded in behavioral genetics. Twin and adoption studies consistently show that shared family environment—the things parents deliberately do—has surprisingly little long-term effect on how children turn out. Whether you read to your kids, send them to expensive schools, or enforce strict homework rules, the evidence suggests these choices matter less than most parents believe.</p>

<p>Genes matter a lot. Peers matter some. Parenting style? Not as much as we'd like to think.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean parenting is pointless. Parents determine whether childhood is pleasant or miserable, and that matters regardless of long-term outcomes. But if intensive parenting doesn't improve adult outcomes, Caplan argued, parents should relax. Stop treating child-rearing as a high-stakes optimization problem. Enjoy your kids. And since each additional child is less work than you think, consider having more of them.</p>

<p>The book led to a memorable debate in <em>The Guardian</em> between Caplan and Amy Chua, the "Tiger Mom" who had just published her own controversial parenting memoir advocating strict discipline and high expectations. Their approaches couldn't have been more different: Chua believed intensive parenting shapes children's futures; Caplan argued the evidence showed otherwise.</p>

<p><em>Kirkus Reviews</em> called the book "inconsistent and unpersuasive." Others found it liberating—permission to stop the exhausting performance of optimized parenting.</p>

<h2>Education as Expensive Signaling</h2>

<p>Caplan's 2018 book <em>The Case Against Education</em> attacks one of modern society's most sacred institutions.</p>

<p>The conventional view of education is straightforward: schools teach skills and knowledge that make workers more productive. A college graduate earns more than a high school graduate because they've learned more. Society benefits from investing in education because it creates human capital—the skills and abilities that make an economy productive.</p>

<p>Caplan doesn't deny that education correlates with higher earnings. But he argues that most of this correlation reflects "signaling" rather than skill-building.</p>

<p>Here's the signaling story. Employers can't directly observe a job candidate's intelligence, conscientiousness, and conformity—traits that predict job performance. But completing a degree proves you have enough of these qualities to survive years of assignments, deadlines, and social navigation. The degree doesn't make you more productive; it reveals that you already were.</p>

<p>Evidence for signaling includes the "sheepskin effect"—the fact that completing a degree raises earnings far more than adding an equivalent number of years of education without the credential. If education purely built skills, each year would contribute equally. Instead, the diploma itself carries most of the wage premium.</p>

<p>If Caplan is right, education becomes something like an expensive arms race. Everyone needs degrees because everyone else has degrees, but the social benefit is far smaller than the private benefit. We'd be better off, collectively, spending less on formal schooling.</p>

<p>This challenges labor economics orthodoxy, which has largely assumed the human capital model. Caplan argues that economists accept it uncritically because they're themselves products of extensive education and naturally believe it was worthwhile.</p>

<h2>The Case for Open Borders</h2>

<p>Immigration restrictions prevent most of the world's population from living and working where they'd be most productive. A software engineer in Lagos could multiply her earnings many times over by moving to Silicon Valley. A farmer in Guatemala could dramatically improve his family's life by working in California's agricultural sector. But legal barriers prevent most such moves.</p>

<p>Caplan thinks this is one of the greatest moral catastrophes of our time.</p>

<p>His 2019 book <em>Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration</em> makes the case in an unusual format: a graphic novel, illustrated by Zach Weinersmith of the webcomic Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. The format was deliberate. Caplan wanted to reach beyond academic audiences and make economic arguments accessible to general readers.</p>

<p>The economic case is straightforward. Allowing workers to move from low-productivity to high-productivity locations creates enormous gains—what economists call "trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk." Studies suggest that open borders could roughly double world GDP. Nothing else we could do would create gains of remotely comparable magnitude.</p>

<p>The ethical case draws on libertarian principles. What gives governments the right to prevent peaceful people from crossing lines on a map? If it's wrong to prohibit someone from Dallas from moving to New York, why is it acceptable to prohibit someone from Tijuana from moving to San Diego?</p>

<p>Caplan addresses common objections—effects on wages, fiscal impacts, cultural change, crime—arguing that the evidence doesn't support restrictionist fears, and that even where concerns have some validity, the solutions don't require severe restriction.</p>

<p>Economist Tyler Cowen, Caplan's colleague at George Mason, called it "a landmark in economic education, how to present economic ideas, and the integration of economic analysis and graphic visuals." <em>The Economist</em> praised it as "a model of respectful, persuasive argument."</p>

<p>Not everyone was convinced. <em>National Review</em>'s Kevin Williamson found the book "fun to read" but felt Caplan dodged some obvious counterarguments and oversimplified a genuinely complex issue.</p>

<h2>Beyond the Academy</h2>

<p>Caplan is prolific. Beyond his major books, he's published multiple essay collections on topics ranging from political irrationality to feminism to self-improvement. He maintains an active blog called "Bet on It"—a title reflecting his willingness to stake real money on his predictions.</p>

<p>In 2024, he published another graphic book, <em>Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation</em>, with illustrator Ady Branzei. It applies similar economic reasoning to housing policy, arguing that zoning and building restrictions create artificial scarcity that drives up prices and hurts renters.</p>

<p>His political philosophy goes beyond standard libertarianism. Caplan describes himself as an anarcho-capitalist—someone who believes that even basic state functions like law enforcement and courts could be better provided by competitive private organizations. This places him outside the mainstream even within libertarian circles.</p>

<p>Writer Brian Doherty, in his history of libertarianism <em>Radicals for Capitalism</em>, discusses Caplan's contributions to anarcho-capitalist thought. Caplan has argued that anarcho-capitalists have a stronger historical claim to the anarchist label than left-wing anarchists who reject capitalism. Left-anarchists, predictably, dispute this interpretation.</p>

<h2>The Consistent Thread</h2>

<p>What unites Caplan's diverse interests? A willingness to follow economic logic to conclusions most people find uncomfortable, combined with genuine curiosity about what the evidence actually shows.</p>

<p>He thinks voters are irrational, but he doesn't conclude we should abolish democracy—just that we should weight expert opinion more heavily on technical questions. He thinks education is mostly signaling, but he's spent his career as a professor—because the system exists and individuals must navigate it as it is, not as it should be. He thinks parenting matters less than we assume, but he's a father of four who by all accounts loves his kids.</p>

<p>Caplan lives with his wife Corina in Oakton, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. It's a fitting location for someone whose work constantly engages with policy debates while maintaining skepticism about whether those debates will ever reach rational conclusions.</p>

<p>He keeps making his arguments anyway. Democracy may be irrational, but persuasion might still work, one reader at a time.</p>

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:
- Opens with a hook about Caplan's contrarian approach rather than biographical dates
- Explains his key concepts (rational irrationality, signaling, the ideological Turing test) from first principles
- Varies paragraph length for better text-to-speech rhythm
- Connects to the related Substack article context by thoroughly covering his parenting arguments from *Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids*
- Maintains a narrative flow throughout rather than listing facts
