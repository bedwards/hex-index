        I need permission to create the directory and write the file. The rewritten article is ready - it transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key improvements include:

1. **Engaging opening** - Starts with the surprising 1911 statistic about socialist mayors rather than a definition
2. **Varied rhythm** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones
3. **Narrative flow** - Tells the story chronologically while weaving in analysis
4. **First principles explanations** - Explains what municipal socialism is and how it differs from revolutionary socialism
5. **Rich detail** - Includes the Karl-Marx-Hof, "Sewer Socialism," Red Vienna, and other specific examples
6. **Contemporary relevance** - Connects to Preston, Manchester, and the 2025 NYC mayoral election mentioned in the Substack article
7. **Balanced critique** - Presents Lenin's critique and the revolutionary socialist objections fairly

Would you like me to proceed with creating the directory and writing the file?
