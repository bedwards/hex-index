        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The essay transforms the encyclopedic source material into a narrative that:

- Opens with a compelling hook (employees hiding posters from Bill Gates)
- Explains the organization's massive scale (vaccinating nearly half the world's children)
- Walks through the funding model and recent shortfalls
- Examines the pneumococcal vaccine pricing controversy in detail
- Explores the vertical vs horizontal debate in global health
- Discusses governance concerns about private donors shaping public priorities
- Covers COVAX and the COVID-19 response
- Ends with forward-looking questions about the organization's future

The piece runs approximately 3,000 words, suitable for about 15-20 minutes of reading/listening time, and maintains the connection to the source Substack article about Bill Gates' climate memo by exploring Gates' influence on global health policy.
