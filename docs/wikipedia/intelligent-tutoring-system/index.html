        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The essay:

- **Opens with a compelling hook** - Bloom's two sigma problem, which frames the entire field's motivation
- **Explains concepts from first principles** - no assumed knowledge about AI, cognitive science, or education
- **Varies sentence and paragraph length** - short punchy sentences mixed with longer explanations for good audio rhythm
- **Spells out acronyms** - ITS, CAI, LOGO, PLATO, ACT-R all introduced properly
- **Draws interesting connections** - links to Leibniz's philosophical dreams, Turing's wartime codebreaking, the personal computer revolution
- **Provides concrete examples** - the LISP Tutor, AutoTutor, the algebra equation example
- **Maintains narrative flow** - chronological spine with thematic detours, not an encyclopedic list
- **Ends reflectively** - acknowledging both achievements and persistent limitations

The piece runs approximately 2,800 words, which should provide about 12-15 minutes of reading with Speechify at normal pace.
