        I've written a comprehensive essay on the Royal Mint that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the compelling hook of Isaac Newton chasing counterfeiters
- Connects directly to the Substack article context about Keynes on Newton
- Traces the mint's history from Celtic coins through to modern e-waste recycling
- Explains technical concepts like debasement, milling, and the token problem in accessible terms
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio listening rhythm
- Adds fascinating details like the sixteen emergency Civil War mints and Newton's disguises in taverns
- Runs approximately 3,400 words (~17 minutes reading time)

The content is ready to be saved as clean semantic HTML. Would you like me to output the HTML directly here instead, or would you prefer to grant write permissions for the file?
