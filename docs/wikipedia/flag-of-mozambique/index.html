<h2>The Only Flag in the World With an Assault Rifle</h2>

<p>Of all the national flags flying at the United Nations, only one features a modern firearm. Mozambique's flag displays an AK-47 with a bayonet attached, crossed over a hoe and resting on an open book. It's a jarring image—a weapon of war as a national symbol—and it has sparked decades of debate about what a country's flag should represent.</p>

<p>But to understand why Mozambique chose to put a Kalashnikov on its flag, you need to understand what that gun meant to the people who carried it into battle against Portuguese colonial rule.</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a Revolutionary Flag</h2>

<p>Look at the Mozambican flag and you'll see three horizontal stripes: green at the top, black in the middle, and golden-yellow at the bottom. Thin white lines separate each stripe. On the left side, a red triangle juts into the design, containing the country's most distinctive emblem: a gold star with the crossed rifle and hoe above an open book.</p>

<p>Every element carries meaning.</p>

<p>Green represents the soil of Mozambique—the land itself, the agricultural foundation of the nation. Golden-yellow stands for what lies beneath that soil: the country's mineral wealth. Black symbolizes the African continent and its people. White represents peace and justice. Red commemorates anti-colonial resistance and the blood shed in the fight for independence.</p>

<p>Then there are the objects on the triangle. The book represents education—the belief that literacy and learning would transform the nation. The hoe represents agricultural production, the work that feeds the country. And the AK-47 represents defense, the armed struggle that made independence possible.</p>

<p>The star carries its own significance: international solidarity. Though the American Central Intelligence Agency's interpretation differs slightly, suggesting the star represents Marxism and proletarian internationalism—a reading that reflects the Cold War context of Mozambique's independence movement.</p>

<h2>From Colony to Nation</h2>

<p>Mozambique spent nearly five centuries under Portuguese control. Unlike Britain or France, which granted independence to most of their African colonies in the early 1960s, Portugal's authoritarian government under António de Oliveira Salazar refused to relinquish its overseas territories. The regime called them "overseas provinces," a linguistic trick meant to suggest that Angola, Mozambique, and other colonies were simply extensions of Portugal itself.</p>

<p>The Mozambique Liberation Front—known by its Portuguese acronym FRELIMO—began armed resistance in 1964. The movement operated largely from exile in neighboring Tanganyika (now Tanzania), where its leaders could organize, train, and launch guerrilla operations across the border.</p>

<p>FRELIMO's original flag looked remarkably similar to Mozambique's current national flag, with the same arrangement of colors but no symbols on the red triangle. Some scholars believe FRELIMO drew inspiration from Tanganyika's flag, given the close relationship between the two. Others suggest the flag of South Africa's African National Congress influenced the design—the ANC was another liberation movement fighting white minority rule during the same era.</p>

<p>The war dragged on for a decade. Portugal, fighting simultaneous colonial wars in Angola and Guinea-Bissau, was bleeding resources. In April 1974, Portuguese military officers overthrew the Salazar regime's successor government in Lisbon, and the new leaders moved quickly to divest from Africa.</p>

<p>On June 25, 1975, the People's Republic of Mozambique declared independence.</p>

<h2>A Flag That Evolved</h2>

<p>The first flag of independent Mozambique looked quite different from today's design. Instead of horizontal stripes, it featured four diagonal bands radiating from the upper left corner: green, red, black, and yellow, separated by white lines. Near the top left sat a white cogwheel—a symbol borrowed from socialist iconography, representing the industrial working class—containing a red star and the crossed rifle and hoe over an open book.</p>

<p>The cogwheel was a deliberate nod to Marxist-Leninist ideology. FRELIMO had aligned itself with the Soviet Union and its allies during the independence struggle, receiving weapons, training, and diplomatic support from the Eastern Bloc. The party embraced scientific socialism as its governing philosophy, nationalizing industries and collectivizing agriculture.</p>

<p>This first flag lasted only eight years. In April 1983, the government redesigned it, returning to the horizontal stripes of FRELIMO's original liberation-era flag but adding the symbols from the independence flag onto a large yellow star inside the red triangle. A month later, on May 1, 1983—International Workers' Day—the cogwheel was removed, producing the flag that still flies today.</p>

<p>The removal of the cogwheel was subtle but significant. It marked a slight step away from the most overt communist symbolism, even as the rifle and star remained.</p>

<h2>The Gun Controversy</h2>

<p>As Mozambique transitioned from a one-party socialist state to a multiparty democracy in 1990, debate erupted over national symbols. The new constitution raised questions: Should a democratic nation keep the flag of a revolutionary movement? Did a gun belong on the banner of a country trying to build peace?</p>

<p>The timing made these questions especially pointed. Mozambique was in the midst of a devastating civil war. The Mozambican National Resistance—known as RENAMO—had been fighting FRELIMO since 1977, initially as a proxy force backed by Rhodesia and later South Africa, then continuing the conflict for its own reasons. By the time peace finally came in 1992, the war had killed an estimated one million people and displaced millions more.</p>

<p>For RENAMO, the flag was a FRELIMO symbol, not a national one. Calling for unity while flying a flag that looked like your enemy's party banner seemed contradictory at best, insulting at worst.</p>

<p>Jorge Rebelo, a member of FRELIMO's political bureau, acknowledged the controversy but declared the flag would remain unchanged. The party that had won independence was not prepared to abandon its symbols.</p>

<h2>The 2005 Redesign Competition</h2>

<p>In 2005, more than a decade after the civil war ended and RENAMO had become the main opposition party in parliament, the government organized a competition to design new national symbols. It was part of the peace process—a gesture toward reconciliation.</p>

<p>RENAMO's demands were specific: remove the AK-47 and the star. José Gabriel Manteigas, a RENAMO member of parliament, laid out the argument plainly.</p>

<blockquote>As a peaceful country, you can't have a flag with a gun on it. For children growing up now in peace, they see a flag with a gun on it, and it doesn't make sense. As for the star, anyone who has seen the Soviet flag knows that a star is the mark of communism.</blockquote>

<p>Manteigas traced the star's lineage to earlier FRELIMO imagery that had included a crossed hammer and hoe beneath a yellow star—what he called "a blood relative of the old Soviet hammer and sickle."</p>

<p>President Joaquim Chissano, himself a former FRELIMO leader, offered a characteristically sharp response: "If Mozambique's single star were to symbolise communism, the Stars and Stripes would place the United States among the world's most leftist nations."</p>

<p>It was a clever riposte, though it sidestepped the deeper question of historical context. Stars appear on many flags for many reasons—but the specific choice of a gold star on a red field, adopted by a Soviet-aligned liberation movement in the 1970s, carried particular connotations.</p>

<p>FRELIMO supporters defended both symbols vigorously. The rifle, they argued, represented the Mozambican people's determination to protect their country—not violence for its own sake, but the capacity for self-defense that made independence possible. The star represented African solidarity, not communist ideology.</p>

<h2>The Vote That Killed Change</h2>

<p>The 2005 competition received 169 entries. A panel of five judges reviewed each proposal.</p>

<p>Then the Assembly of the Republic voted.</p>

<p>The result was 155 to 79 against changing the flag. Every single vote against came from FRELIMO members. Every vote in favor came from RENAMO.</p>

<p>The pattern revealed the flag's real meaning in Mozambican politics. It wasn't just about colors and symbols—it was about power, identity, and the question of who gets to define the nation's story. FRELIMO saw the flag as a legitimate representation of the struggle that created independent Mozambique. RENAMO saw it as a partisan symbol masquerading as a national one.</p>

<p>The flag remained unchanged.</p>

<h2>The Strange Reality of Flags on the Ground</h2>

<p>There's an irony in all this passion over symbols. In practice, the Mozambican flag is often absent from the very places it's supposed to fly.</p>

<p>The law is clear. Decree number 47 of 2006, titled "State Protocol Standards," specifies exactly who may display the flag and where it should appear. Government offices, military barracks, airports, schools, hospitals—all should fly the national flag. The president, prime minister, heads of courts, provincial governors, and diplomats may display the flag on their vehicles.</p>

<p>Reality is messier.</p>

<p>A 2023 investigation by the Mozambican newspaper O País found that most state buildings in the western city of Tete flew no flag at all. Those that did often displayed flags "in poor condition and with altered colours"—faded by sun, tattered by wind, or simply the wrong shade due to inconsistent manufacturing. At Francisco Manyanga Secondary School, the flag was "completely torn."</p>

<p>Financial and logistical challenges explain part of the problem. Flags wear out. Replacing them costs money. And when budgets are tight, a new flag often falls low on the priority list.</p>

<h2>What Color Is Mozambican Green?</h2>

<p>Here's an oddity: the constitution defines the flag's colors but not their specific shades. This creates confusion.</p>

<p>When the London Organising Committee prepared for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, they needed precise color specifications for every nation's flag. For Mozambique, they used Pantone 355 for green, Pantone 109 for yellow, and Pantone 185 for red.</p>

<p>But if you visit the official website of the Mozambican government, you'll see different colors: Pantone 328 for green, Pantone 102 for yellow, and Pantone 186 for red.</p>

<p>The difference isn't subtle. Pantone 355 is a bright, vibrant green—almost grass-like. Pantone 328 is darker and more teal, closer to forest green. Which one is correct? Both, technically. Neither shade violates the constitution, which simply says "green."</p>

<p>This ambiguity means that Mozambican flags produced by different manufacturers can look noticeably different from one another—a minor chaos of official symbols.</p>

<h2>The Rifle in Context</h2>

<p>The AK-47 on Mozambique's flag remains unique among national flags. No other country displays a modern firearm on its official banner.</p>

<p>Weapons do appear on other flags, but they tend to be more abstract or historical. Guatemala's flag features crossed rifles, but they're 19th-century muskets. Haiti's flag includes cannons. Saudi Arabia's flag bears a sword—but a sword is a weapon of a different era, carrying connotations of tradition and heritage rather than contemporary warfare.</p>

<p>The Kalashnikov is different. Designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the Soviet Union after World War II, the AK-47 became the most widely produced firearm in history. Estimates suggest over 100 million have been manufactured. Its reliability, simplicity, and low cost made it the weapon of choice for revolutionary movements across the developing world during the Cold War—from Vietnam to Africa to Latin America.</p>

<p>When FRELIMO fighters carried AK-47s into battle against Portuguese forces, they were using the same weapon as guerrillas and liberation movements across three continents. The gun became synonymous with anti-colonial struggle, armed resistance, and the violent birth of new nations.</p>

<p>For Mozambique to place it on the flag was to make a statement: this nation was born in armed struggle, and it will not forget.</p>

<h2>The Question That Won't Go Away</h2>

<p>More than thirty years after the civil war ended, the debate continues. Each generation of Mozambicans grows up under a flag that older citizens remember from the liberation struggle—and that younger citizens see with fresh eyes.</p>

<p>For those who fought for independence or lived through it, the rifle represents sacrifice, determination, and ultimate victory. It's a reminder that freedom wasn't given but taken. The gun on the flag says: we were willing to fight and die for this nation.</p>

<p>For those born into peace, the symbolism can feel different. Why should a country trying to build a stable democracy and attract international investment display a weapon of war? What does it say to children learning about their country? What message does it send to the world?</p>

<p>These aren't questions with easy answers. National symbols always carry multiple meanings, and those meanings shift over time. The American flag once represented rebellion against monarchy; now it represents the most powerful nation on Earth. The French tricolor began as a revolutionary symbol; now it flies over a permanent member of the UN Security Council.</p>

<p>Perhaps the AK-47 on Mozambique's flag will undergo a similar transformation—becoming less a literal representation of armed struggle and more an abstract symbol of the nation's origin story. Or perhaps a future government will finally change it, choosing new symbols for a new era.</p>

<p>For now, the flag flies as it has since 1983: green and black and gold and white and red, with a book and a hoe and a rifle, the only national flag in the world that features an assault weapon designed in the 20th century.</p>

<p>It's a reminder that nations are born in specific historical moments, under specific circumstances. And sometimes those circumstances were violent.</p>
