        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on Animal Testing. The article:

- **Opens with the 1925 Nome serum run hook** - connecting the famous Iditarod story to the lesser-known guinea pig experiments that made the serum possible
- **Flows as a narrative essay** rather than an encyclopedia entry, with varied paragraph lengths for good audio rhythm
- **Covers all major content** including the history from ancient Greece through modern times, key breakthroughs (fruit fly genetics, mouse strains, polio vaccine, insulin, lithium), the regulatory response to tragedies like thalidomide, and the ongoing ethical debates
- **Explains technical concepts from first principles** - like why shared evolution makes animal testing possible, what inbred mouse strains are and why they matter
- **Spells out acronyms** (PET scans, FIV) and avoids jargon
- **Adds narrative touches** like Abbie Lathrop raising mice as pets, Laika the space dog, and Frances Kelsey's vigilance saving the US from thalidomide
- **Ends reflectively** on the uncomfortable middle ground most people occupy

The HTML follows the existing site template with proper semantic markup (`<p>`, `<h2>`, `<blockquote>`, `<em>`) and the standard header/footer structure.

The article should take approximately 18 minutes to read aloud, providing substantial content while remaining accessible for Speechify listening.
