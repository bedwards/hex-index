<p>If you want to sponsor your spouse to join you in Canada and you live in Quebec, you might wait three and a half years. If you live in Ontario or British Columbia, you'll wait about thirteen months. Same country, same federal government, same immigration system—yet a spouse in Montreal waits nearly three times longer than one in Toronto.</p>

<p>This peculiar disparity reveals something fundamental about how Canada actually works, and it begins with a federal department that most Canadians interact with at the most consequential moments of their lives: when they become citizens, when they bring family members to join them, or when they flee persecution and seek refuge.</p>

<h2>The Department That Decides Who Gets In</h2>

<p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada—usually called IRCC, pronounced as individual letters—is the arm of the Canadian federal government that handles three intertwined questions: Who can come to Canada? Who can stay? And who can become Canadian?</p>

<p>These might sound like simple administrative matters, but they touch something deeper. Every country must decide who belongs. The rules a nation sets for membership reveal its values, its anxieties, and its vision of itself.</p>

<p>IRCC employs roughly seven thousand people across Canada and around the world. They staff processing centers scattered across the country—in Sydney, Nova Scotia; Mississauga, Ontario; Edmonton, Alberta—and they work in Canadian embassies and consulates from Beijing to Bogotá, from New Delhi to Nairobi. In fiscal year 2018-2019, the department spent nearly two and a half billion Canadian dollars.</p>

<p>That money flows through an elaborate system of programs: economic immigration streams designed to attract skilled workers, family reunification programs that let Canadians bring relatives to join them, refugee resettlement programs that offer protection to those fleeing persecution, and citizenship services that transform permanent residents into full Canadians with voting rights and passports.</p>

<h2>Before There Were Canadians</h2>

<p>Here's something that might surprise you: Canadian citizenship, as a legal concept, didn't exist until 1947.</p>

<p>Before that, people born in Canada were British subjects. So were naturalized immigrants. The passport they carried said "British Subject" on it. Canada was a self-governing dominion within the British Empire, and while Canadians had their own Parliament and their own prime minister, their legal identity remained tied to the Crown.</p>

<p>The Citizenship Act of 1947 changed that. For the first time, it created a distinct legal status called "Canadian citizen." This was part of a broader postwar shift as Commonwealth countries—Australia, New Zealand, South Africa—began asserting more independent identities while maintaining their connection to Britain.</p>

<p>The British North America Act of 1867, which created Canada as a country, had split responsibility for immigration between the federal government and the provinces. This division persists today, and it explains the Quebec situation we'll return to later.</p>

<h2>How the System Actually Works</h2>

<p>Imagine you want to move to Canada. What happens?</p>

<p>First, you probably won't deal with IRCC directly—at least not at first. If you're applying from abroad, you'll interact with staff at a Canadian embassy, high commission, or consulate. These diplomatic posts serve as the front line of Canadian immigration, processing applications from people around the world.</p>

<p>The geography matters. Certain posts serve as regional processing hubs, handling applications from multiple countries. An application from someone in a smaller country might get processed at an embassy in a larger neighboring nation.</p>

<p>If you make it to Canada, you'll encounter a different agency at the border: the Canada Border Services Agency, or CBSA. These are the officers who check your documents when you arrive at Toronto Pearson Airport or drive across from Detroit to Windsor. CBSA handles enforcement—deciding who actually gets through the door—while IRCC makes the policies and processes the paperwork that determines who's eligible to approach that door in the first place.</p>

<p>Once you're in Canada, you might interact with Service Canada, which handles some domestic immigration services alongside its other responsibilities like employment insurance and social insurance numbers.</p>

<p>And if you apply for citizenship? Your application goes to the Citizenship Commission, which operates under IRCC. Citizenship judges—there are several dozen across the country—evaluate whether applicants meet the requirements. They check residency: Have you actually lived in Canada long enough? They administer the citizenship test. And when everything checks out, they preside over citizenship ceremonies where new Canadians take the Oath of Citizenship.</p>

<h2>The Syrian Refugee Moment</h2>

<p>In late 2015 and early 2016, Canada demonstrated what its immigration system could do when political will aligned with public sentiment.</p>

<p>The Syrian civil war had created millions of refugees. The image of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, drowned on a Turkish beach while his family tried to reach Europe, shocked the world. In Canada, it emerged that the family had been trying to come to Canada; relatives in British Columbia had tried to sponsor them.</p>

<p>The newly elected Liberal government of Justin Trudeau promised to resettle twenty-five thousand Syrian refugees by February 2016. This was an extraordinarily ambitious timeline for a bureaucracy that usually moves deliberately.</p>

<p>They made it work through three different streams.</p>

<p>Government-Assisted Refugees—GARs—received direct support from IRCC through the Resettlement Assistance Program. The government covered their initial settlement costs: housing, language training, help finding jobs.</p>

<p>Privately Sponsored Refugees—PSRs—came through a uniquely Canadian program. Private citizens, churches, community groups, and other organizations agreed to financially support refugee families for their first year in Canada. This meant providing housing, helping with job searches, teaching the newcomers how to navigate Canadian systems from healthcare to grocery shopping.</p>

<p>Blended Visa Office-Referred Refugees—BVORs—split the difference. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, usually called UNHCR, identified particularly vulnerable refugees and referred them to Canada. Then private sponsors were matched with these families, sharing support responsibilities with the government.</p>

<p>The private sponsorship model is something Canada pioneered in the late 1970s, originally for Vietnamese "boat people" refugees. It's been widely studied and sometimes imitated by other countries because it accomplishes something clever: it harnesses private generosity and community involvement while maintaining government oversight. Sponsors aren't just writing checks; they're forming relationships with newcomer families, helping them integrate into Canadian society in ways that government programs alone rarely achieve.</p>

<h2>The Quebec Paradox</h2>

<p>Now back to that three-and-a-half-year wait in Quebec.</p>

<p>Quebec is not a province like the others. It has its own civil law system, based on French rather than English common law. It has its own pension plan. And crucially, it has far more control over its own immigration than any other province.</p>

<p>The constitutional division of powers gives both federal and provincial governments authority over immigration, but in practice, most provinces let Ottawa handle it. Quebec negotiated special arrangements, culminating in the Canada-Quebec Accord of 1991, that gave the province control over selecting its own immigrants.</p>

<p>This means Quebec sets its own annual quotas for different immigration categories. And therein lies the problem.</p>

<p>Quebec caps family reunification numbers. When those caps are nearly reached—as happened in 2023—the pipeline backs up. The federal government processes the applications, but it can't approve more people than Quebec will accept.</p>

<p>As of late 2023, about thirty-eight thousand and eight hundred sponsorship applications were pending in Quebec. The provincial government points to the federal government, noting that Ottawa processes the applications once Quebec issues its selection certificates. The federal government points back at Quebec's quotas. Immigration advocates argue that Quebec should shift some of its quota allocation from economic immigrants to family reunification.</p>

<p>It's a classic federalism problem: shared jurisdiction creating shared blame and frustrated citizens caught in the middle.</p>

<h2>The Passport Power</h2>

<p>One of IRCC's responsibilities rarely makes headlines but affects millions of people: issuing Canadian passports.</p>

<p>A Canadian passport is, by most measures, one of the world's most powerful travel documents. It grants visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to over a hundred and eighty countries. This matters enormously for business travelers, tourists, and Canadians with family abroad.</p>

<p>IRCC issues passports not just to citizens but also provides travel documents to permanent residents and protected persons—people who've been granted refugee status but haven't yet become citizens. These documents allow travel while protecting individuals who can't safely obtain passports from their countries of origin.</p>

<h2>The Citizenship Oath</h2>

<p>The final step of becoming Canadian—taking the Oath of Citizenship—is one of those rituals that reveals what a country thinks citizenship means.</p>

<p>Here's the text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King Charles the Third, King of Canada, His Heirs and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada, including the Constitution, which recognizes and affirms the Aboriginal and treaty rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples, and fulfill my duties as a Canadian citizen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That oath contains layers of Canadian identity. The reference to the monarch connects Canada to its British heritage and constitutional structure as a parliamentary democracy. The explicit mention of Indigenous peoples' rights, added in 2021, acknowledges historical injustices and ongoing reconciliation efforts. The word "affirm" alongside "swear" accommodates those whose religious beliefs prohibit oath-taking.</p>

<p>Citizenship ceremonies happen in courthouses, community centers, and sometimes at special events. New citizens have taken the oath at hockey games, at the Calgary Stampede, in Parliament. The ceremony is meant to be celebratory, a moment when someone's status changes fundamentally—from permanent resident, with the right to live and work in Canada, to citizen, with the right to vote, hold a Canadian passport, and never be deported.</p>

<h2>The Screening Function</h2>

<p>Immigration systems have another purpose that generates less warm feeling: keeping people out.</p>

<p>IRCC, working with partner agencies, screens potential immigrants and visitors to, as the government puts it, "protect the health, safety and security of Canadians." This means checking criminal backgrounds, assessing security risks, and conducting medical examinations.</p>

<p>The Canada Border Services Agency handles enforcement at the border, but IRCC sets the policies that determine inadmissibility. Certain criminal convictions make you inadmissible. Certain health conditions can too—though Canada's approach has become more liberal over time, particularly for mental health conditions and HIV.</p>

<p>Security screening remains controversial. The balance between security and welcoming newcomers is genuinely difficult. Too much scrutiny slows processing and creates the backlogs that leave families separated for years. Too little raises risks that the public won't accept.</p>

<h2>What This Means for a Particular Family</h2>

<p>The Substack article that prompted this exploration tells a specific story—a letter from a family navigating this system. The bureaucratic abstraction of "processing times" and "quotas" and "selection certificates" translates, for individual families, into years of waiting, uncertainty, and separation.</p>

<p>Understanding the system doesn't make the waiting easier. But it does explain why the waiting happens, why it varies so dramatically depending on where in Canada your sponsor lives, and why the promises of politicians don't always match the realities of processing centers working through backlogs.</p>

<p>Canada has built a reputation as a welcoming country for immigrants and refugees. That reputation rests on real accomplishments—the Syrian resettlement, the private sponsorship program, the relatively smooth integration of newcomers into Canadian society. But it also rests on a bureaucracy that, like all bureaucracies, moves slowly, follows rules that sometimes produce absurd results, and leaves people waiting.</p>

<p>Seven thousand employees, two and a half billion dollars, processing centers on four continents—and still, someone in Quebec waits forty-two months to be reunited with their spouse while someone in Ontario waits thirteen. That gap tells you something important about how Canada actually works, with its federal-provincial negotiations and its regional jealousies and its competing visions of what the country should be.</p>

<p>Immigration policy is never just about efficiency. It's about identity, about who we're willing to call one of us, about how much we're willing to change to accommodate newcomers and how much we expect them to change to accommodate us. The machinery of IRCC—the processing centers and citizenship judges and quota negotiations—is how Canada answers those questions, one application at a time.</p>
