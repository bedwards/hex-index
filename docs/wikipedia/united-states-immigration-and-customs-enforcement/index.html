<p>On a snowy January morning in 2026, a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman named Renée Nicole Good as she drove away from officers on a residential street in Minneapolis. She was a legal observer—a volunteer trained to watch police conduct and document it for potential court cases. The agent who killed her worked for an agency that, just twenty-three years earlier, hadn't existed at all.</p>

<p>That agency is United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known universally by its acronym: ICE.</p>

<h2>Born from the Ashes of September 11th</h2>

<p>ICE did not emerge from careful policy deliberation or long-standing law enforcement tradition. It was born from crisis.</p>

<p>When terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the federal government underwent its most dramatic reorganization since the creation of the Department of Defense after World War II. Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which dismantled two venerable agencies and scattered their functions across three new ones.</p>

<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which had handled both immigration enforcement and citizenship services since 1933, was dissolved. So was the United States Customs Service, which had collected tariffs and policed smuggling since the earliest days of the republic. Their personnel, their budgets, and their missions were divided up and redistributed.</p>

<p>What emerged were three agencies with overlapping but distinct purposes. Customs and Border Protection got the job of patrolling the actual borders—the agents you see at airports and the officers in green uniforms along the Rio Grande. Citizenship and Immigration Services inherited the paperwork side: processing visa applications, naturalizing new citizens, adjudicating asylum claims. And ICE got everything else: the investigators who tracked smuggling networks, the agents who arrested people for immigration violations, and the officers who detained and deported them.</p>

<p>From day one, this was an awkward arrangement.</p>

<h2>Two Agencies Wearing One Badge</h2>

<p>ICE is not really one agency. It's two completely separate law enforcement operations that happen to share a name, a budget, and a reputation.</p>

<p>The first is Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI. These are federal investigators who work cases involving transnational crime: human trafficking, drug smuggling, intellectual property theft, money laundering, child exploitation, and cybercrime. They're essentially federal detectives, and their work often has little to do with immigration. An HSI agent might spend years building a case against an international criminal network without ever encountering an undocumented immigrant.</p>

<p>The second is Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO. These are the agents most people picture when they hear the word "ICE"—the ones who conduct raids, arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally, run detention facilities, and execute deportations. ERO is the face of immigration enforcement, and it's the source of almost all the controversy that surrounds the agency.</p>

<p>This matters because the two branches have fundamentally different relationships with the communities they work in. HSI investigators often need cooperation from immigrant communities to build their cases. They need witnesses to come forward, victims to testify, and sources to provide tips about criminal activity. But that cooperation evaporates when people fear that any contact with anyone wearing an ICE badge might result in their deportation.</p>

<p>In 2018, nineteen senior HSI officials—the special agents in charge of every major investigative division—sent a remarkable letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security. They asked to be separated from ICE entirely. The linkage to ERO's politically charged enforcement activities, they wrote, was "hamstringing" their investigative work. Jurisdictions were refusing to cooperate with HSI because they couldn't distinguish it from the deportation force. The letter compared the situation to imagining the FBI being administratively paired with the Bureau of Prisons.</p>

<p>The Trump administration ignored the request.</p>

<h2>A Long and Tangled History</h2>

<p>The federal government's authority to control immigration wasn't always obvious. The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention immigration. For nearly a century after independence, states largely controlled who could enter and settle within their borders.</p>

<p>That changed in 1876, when the Supreme Court decided a case called Chy Lung v. Freeman. A woman named Chy Lung had arrived in San Francisco on a steamship from China, and California officials tried to bar her entry under a state law that excluded various categories of "lewd and debauched" women—a thinly veiled attempt to block Chinese immigration. The Court ruled unanimously that only the federal government could regulate immigration, striking down the California law and establishing a principle that would shape American policy ever since.</p>

<p>Federal immigration bureaucracy began modestly. The Immigration Act of 1891 created a commissioner of immigration within the Treasury Department. The agency bounced between departments over the following decades: to Commerce and Labor in 1903, to the standalone Department of Labor when Commerce and Labor split in 1913, and finally to the Justice Department in 1940, as World War II heightened concerns about national security.</p>

<p>For sixty years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service was the face of federal immigration enforcement. Its agents were known in Spanish-speaking communities as "la migra"—a term that carried the weight of fear and the intimacy of familiarity. When ICE replaced the INS in 2003, it inherited that nickname along with everything else.</p>

<h2>The Numbers Game</h2>

<p>Under the Obama administration, deportations reached record levels. Between 2009 and 2016, nearly 2.4 million undocumented immigrants were removed from the United States. Janet Murguía, president of the advocacy group National Council of La Raza, gave Obama a nickname that stung: "Deporter-in-Chief."</p>

<p>But the numbers require context.</p>

<p>Part of the increase reflected a change in how deportations were counted that began under the Bush administration. Previously, many people caught at the border were simply sent back without formal proceedings—they didn't show up in deportation statistics. Under the new approach, these removals were officially recorded. The policy hadn't necessarily become more aggressive; the bookkeeping had become more complete.</p>

<p>Still, ICE data from this period reveals something striking about who was actually being deported. About 40 percent of those removed in 2015 had no criminal conviction whatsoever. Among those who did have convictions, most were for minor offenses. The image of ICE as an agency focused on dangerous criminals was always more aspiration than reality.</p>

<h2>The First Trump Era</h2>

<p>When Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he immediately transformed ICE's mandate.</p>

<p>The Obama administration had established priorities for enforcement. The agency was supposed to focus its limited resources on people who had committed serious crimes, posed national security threats, or had recently crossed the border illegally. Not everyone without legal status was equally targeted.</p>

<p>Trump erased those distinctions. One of his earliest executive orders directed ICE to pursue anyone the agency believed had entered illegally, regardless of how long they'd lived in the country, how deep their community ties ran, or whether they'd ever committed any other offense. The same order called for hiring 10,000 new ICE agents.</p>

<p>The change was immediate and visible. ICE began conducting high-profile raids at workplaces, pulling workers off factory floors and out of restaurant kitchens. Agents appeared at courthouses, waiting to arrest people who had shown up for civil proceedings unrelated to their immigration status. They staked out churches and schools—spaces that had previously been considered off-limits for enforcement, not by law but by long-standing practice.</p>

<p>The number of arrests climbed. So did something else: arrests of American citizens. When enforcement becomes aggressive and indiscriminate, mistakes multiply.</p>

<p>By 2018, a political movement had emerged calling for ICE's abolition. Several Democratic lawmakers endorsed the idea. It never came close to becoming policy, but it signaled how thoroughly the agency had become a focal point of national controversy.</p>

<h2>The Largest Law Enforcement Agency in American History</h2>

<p>The second Trump administration, beginning in January 2025, made the first look restrained by comparison.</p>

<p>Within days, the administration rolled back an Obama-era directive that had protected undocumented immigrants in "sensitive locations"—hospitals, places of worship, courtrooms, funerals, weddings, and schools. Nowhere was off-limits anymore.</p>

<p>The military was deployed to assist ICE in multiple states. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime statute that had been used to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, to deport people quickly with limited or no due process. Some deportees were sent directly to prisons in El Salvador.</p>

<p>Several American citizens were detained and deported. This wasn't bureaucratic error but predictable consequence: when speed matters more than accuracy, when targets are set rather than evidence followed, people who belong get swept up with people who don't.</p>

<p>Then came the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed on July 4, 2025. Among its many provisions, the law allocated unprecedented funding to ICE—more than any federal law enforcement agency had ever received, and more than the entire federal prison system. Money flowed to detention facilities, deportation operations, and recruitment. The agency offered signing bonuses of $50,000 and $60,000 in college loan forgiveness to attract sworn police officers from local departments.</p>

<p>ICE began the year with over 20,000 employees. The Department of Homeland Security began recruiting 10,000 more agents. An additional 5,000 personnel from other federal law enforcement agencies were detailed to support immigration enforcement. And 21,000 National Guard troops were mobilized to help.</p>

<p>By December 2025, ICE held nearly 70,000 people in detention. About 40,000 of them had no criminal record or only pending charges. Between January and December, the administration arrested over 328,000 people and deported nearly 327,000.</p>

<h2>The Visible and the Invisible</h2>

<p>Something changed about how ICE operated, and how it wanted to be seen.</p>

<p>Agents increasingly wore civilian clothing rather than uniforms. They wore masks to conceal their faces. They drove unmarked vehicles. This had practical justifications—protecting officer identity, facilitating certain operations—but it also meant that anyone could claim to be from ICE, and people who were from ICE could deny it.</p>

<p>The administration launched what observers called a "publicity campaign" around enforcement. High-profile arrests were announced. Operations were given dramatic names. The visibility was deliberate—intended to deter illegal immigration by making enforcement seem omnipresent and inescapable.</p>

<p>But visibility cuts both ways. Legal and law enforcement experts noted a spike in people impersonating ICE agents, using the fear and confusion created by plainclothes enforcement to commit crimes of their own.</p>

<p>Federal courts found evidence that the agency was engaged in racial profiling—targeting "Hispanic looking" people for questioning and detention. The administration set daily arrest targets, pushing agents to meet quotas rather than prioritize the most serious cases.</p>

<p>By November, half of ICE's top leadership had been fired or reassigned. Many were replaced with Border Patrol officials. The Chicago Tribune reported that the shakeup reflected the administration's frustration with ICE's relatively targeted approach to enforcement. Border Patrol's methods were blunter: stopping random people on the street and demanding to know their birthplace and citizenship status.</p>

<h2>What Happens Inside</h2>

<p>ICE detention facilities are not prisons in the traditional sense. People held in them haven't been convicted of crimes through the criminal justice system. They're being held while their immigration status is determined or while awaiting deportation. The legal framework is civil, not criminal, which means fewer protections and less oversight.</p>

<p>In July 2025, The Guardian reported on conditions at a facility in Florida that inmates called "Alligator Alcatraz." Human Rights Watch, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Sanctuary of the South had documented a succession of alleged abuses through interviews with detainees. People reported being deprived of food, water, and showers.</p>

<p>In the first months of the second Trump administration, several people died in ICE custody. The exact circumstances varied, but the pattern was clear: a system under pressure, expanding rapidly, with less oversight rather than more.</p>

<h2>Resistance and Violence</h2>

<p>As ICE expanded, so did opposition to it.</p>

<p>Demonstrations emerged nationwide throughout 2025. The June protests in Los Angeles drew particular attention, but they were part of a broader wave of public opposition. By July, multiple polls showed that a majority of Americans disapproved of the agency—a more negative public opinion than during the 2018 "Abolish ICE" movement.</p>

<p>The Pew Research Center documented a sharp partisan divide. Among Republican supporters, 72 percent viewed ICE favorably. Among Democratic supporters, 78 percent viewed it negatively. The agency had become not just a law enforcement body but a symbol—meaning entirely different things depending on who was asked.</p>

<p>Some opposition turned violent.</p>

<p>On July 4, 2025, a group attacked an ICE detention center in Alvarado, Texas. On August 25, a 36-year-old was arrested at a Dallas field office for claiming he had a bomb and displaying what he said was a detonator on his wrist. On September 24, a gunman on a nearby rooftop fired a rifle at a van at the same Dallas office, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before killing himself. One of the injured died six days later.</p>

<h2>The Spanish Name</h2>

<p>In immigrant communities, ICE is still called "la migra"—the same term their parents and grandparents used for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the same term their great-grandparents used before that.</p>

<p>The name change in 2003 mattered enormously to policymakers, to organizational charts, to budget appropriations. To the people whose lives the agency most directly affects, the continuity runs deeper than any acronym. It's still the same knock on the door, the same van idling outside the apartment complex, the same fear that any interaction with authority might end with a family torn apart.</p>

<p>What has changed is scale, and the sense that limits which once constrained enforcement—practical, political, or moral—have fallen away. Churches were once sanctuaries. Courthouses were once places where even undocumented immigrants could seek justice. Hospitals were once spaces of healing where immigration status didn't matter.</p>

<p>By 2025, those sanctuaries had been formally abolished as a matter of policy.</p>

<h2>A New Kind of Agency</h2>

<p>Critics have struggled to find the right words for what ICE has become.</p>

<p>Some call it a militarized police force, pointing to the coordination with military personnel, the tactical equipment, the methods borrowed from combat operations. Others call it a secret police, noting the unmarked vehicles, the masked agents, the operations that deliberately avoid public scrutiny. Still others use the term "paramilitary civilian law enforcement agency," which captures the strange hybrid nature of an organization with the equipment and tactics of soldiers but the domestic jurisdiction of police.</p>

<p>None of these labels is quite right, and all of them capture something true.</p>

<p>What's undeniable is that ICE in 2025 bears little resemblance to the agency created in 2003, which itself bore little resemblance to the Immigration and Naturalization Service it replaced. The fundamental question—who gets to be in America, and who decides—remains the same. But the apparatus for answering it has grown larger, more aggressive, and more central to American political life than anyone anticipated when Congress hastily reorganized the federal government in the panicked months after September 11th.</p>

<p>The agency that didn't exist twenty-three years ago is now the largest and most well-funded law enforcement body in American history. Whether that represents the fulfillment of its mission or a dangerous departure from American values depends entirely on which 72 percent or 78 percent you ask.</p>

<p>On a snowy street in Minneapolis, that question became personal for Renée Nicole Good, who went out one January morning to observe and document, and didn't come home.</p>
