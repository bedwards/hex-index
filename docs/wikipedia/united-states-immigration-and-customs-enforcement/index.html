<p>In July 2025, the United States Congress passed legislation that transformed a federal agency into the largest and most well-funded law enforcement body in American history—larger than the Federal Bureau of Investigation, better funded than the entire federal prison system. That agency was Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known universally by its acronym: ICE.</p>

<p>The expansion marked a dramatic escalation in a story that began over two decades earlier, in the fearful aftermath of September 11, 2001. But to understand how ICE became what it is today, you have to understand that it was born from the ashes of older institutions—and that from its very first day, it contained within itself a fundamental tension that would never be resolved.</p>

<h2>Two Agencies Wearing One Name</h2>

<p>Here's something most Americans don't realize: ICE isn't really one agency. It's two completely separate law enforcement operations that happen to share a bureaucratic parent.</p>

<p>The first is Homeland Security Investigations, or HSI. These are federal agents who investigate transnational crime—drug trafficking, human smuggling, cybercrimes, money laundering. They work closely with other law enforcement agencies, coordinate with foreign governments, and build complex criminal cases. In many ways, they operate like the FBI's lesser-known cousin.</p>

<p>The second is Enforcement and Removal Operations, or ERO. This is the part of ICE that most people picture when they hear the name: the agents who arrest undocumented immigrants, operate detention facilities, and carry out deportations. ERO is the face of immigration enforcement that appears on the news, conducts workplace raids, and has become a lightning rod for political controversy.</p>

<p>These two branches have almost nothing in common except a shared acronym and headquarters. They have different missions, different methods, and—critically—different reputations.</p>

<p>This matters because HSI agents have long complained that being associated with ERO damages their work. In 2018, nineteen of HSI's most senior field commanders sent an extraordinary letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security requesting a divorce. They wanted to become a separate agency entirely, arguing that local police departments and foreign governments were increasingly unwilling to cooperate with HSI investigators because of the political toxicity surrounding ERO's immigration enforcement activities.</p>

<p>The letter drew a pointed comparison: "No U.S. Department of Justice law enforcement agency is paired with another disparate entity," the commanders wrote. "The FBI is not paired with the Bureau of Prisons." Their request was ignored.</p>

<h2>Born From Fear</h2>

<p>ICE exists because of a single traumatic day in American history.</p>

<p>Before September 11, 2001, immigration enforcement was handled by an agency called the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which sat within the Department of Justice. Customs enforcement—the inspection of goods crossing borders—was handled by the United States Customs Service under the Treasury Department. These agencies had existed, in various forms, for over a century.</p>

<p>The roots go back even further. In 1876, the Supreme Court established in a case called Chy Lung v. Freeman that the federal government—not individual states—had the power to set and enforce immigration rules. This might seem obvious today, but it was a significant ruling that centralized immigration policy in Washington. Over the following decades, immigration enforcement bounced between different departments: Treasury, then Commerce and Labor, then just Labor, and finally Justice in 1940 as World War II raised concerns about national security.</p>

<p>After September 11, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the Department of Homeland Security—the largest reorganization of the federal government since the National Security Act of 1947 created the modern intelligence community. The new department absorbed twenty-two existing agencies, including both the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Customs Service.</p>

<p>These two agencies were dissolved on March 1, 2003. Their functions were split among three new entities: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (which handles green cards, naturalization, and work permits), Customs and Border Protection (which staffs ports of entry and patrols the borders), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which investigates crimes and removes people from the country).</p>

<p>It's worth pausing to note what ICE doesn't do: its agents don't patrol the borders. That green-uniformed Border Patrol you see at the southern frontier? That's Customs and Border Protection, a different agency. ICE operates inside the country.</p>

<h2>The Obama Years: Deportation Record</h2>

<p>A common misconception holds that immigration enforcement was lax before the Trump administration. The statistics tell a different story.</p>

<p>Between 2009 and 2016, the Obama administration deported approximately 2.4 million undocumented immigrants—a record that earned President Obama the nickname "Deporter-in-Chief" from Janet Murguía, then president of the National Council of La Raza, a prominent Latino civil rights organization.</p>

<p>There's an important caveat here. The record numbers were partly an artifact of how deportations were counted. The Bush administration had begun including certain border apprehensions in deportation statistics, and the Obama administration continued this practice. Still, the raw numbers were substantial.</p>

<p>What distinguished the Obama approach was prioritization. The administration directed ICE to focus on people with serious criminal convictions. About sixty percent of those deported in 2015 had some kind of criminal record, though a majority of those convictions were for minor offenses. Roughly forty percent had no criminal conviction at all.</p>

<p>This policy of prioritization would prove to be temporary.</p>

<h2>The First Trump Administration: Expanding the Target</h2>

<p>When Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he immediately moved to reshape immigration enforcement. Within days of his inauguration, he signed an executive order calling for ICE's workforce to increase by 10,000 people.</p>

<p>More significantly, the administration abandoned the Obama-era approach of focusing on people with serious criminal records. Instead, ICE was directed to pursue anyone it believed had entered the country illegally. The practical effect was dramatic: the pool of potential enforcement targets expanded from a subset of undocumented immigrants to essentially all of them.</p>

<p>ICE began conducting high-profile raids at workplaces, churches, and schools—locations that had traditionally been treated as sensitive areas where enforcement was minimized. The number of arrests and encounters increased substantially. So did something else: arrests and detentions of United States citizens, caught up in enforcement actions targeting others.</p>

<p>The backlash was fierce. By 2018, protests erupted across the country. Some progressive politicians began calling for ICE to be abolished entirely—a fringe position that nonetheless entered mainstream political discourse. The "Abolish ICE" movement reflected a growing sentiment that the agency had become unreformable.</p>

<p>Then came the letter from those nineteen HSI commanders, pleading to escape the political shadow of their sister branch.</p>

<p>And then Trump lost the 2020 election.</p>

<h2>The Second Trump Administration: Escalation</h2>

<p>When Trump returned to the presidency in January 2025, he moved even faster than before.</p>

<p>Within two days of his inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was rolling back an Obama-era directive that had protected immigrants in "sensitive locations"—hospitals, churches, courthouses, funerals, weddings, schools. These had been considered places where the trauma of immigration enforcement should be avoided, both for humanitarian reasons and to encourage undocumented immigrants to access essential services without fear. That policy was now gone.</p>

<p>The administration also announced it would begin deporting people who had been temporarily admitted under the Biden administration's humanitarian programs. The U.S. military was deployed to assist ICE in multiple states—an extraordinary use of armed forces for domestic law enforcement.</p>

<p>Perhaps most controversially, the administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a law from 1798 originally designed for wartime. The act allows the president to detain and deport citizens of hostile nations without the normal due process protections. Using this authority, the administration began rapidly deporting people with limited judicial review, including sending some individuals to prisons in El Salvador.</p>

<p>Mistakes were made. Several American citizens were detained and deported.</p>

<p>The administration set daily arrest quotas for ICE and launched what critics called a deliberate publicity campaign to increase visibility of enforcement actions. ICE agents were noted for their distinctive approach: wearing masks, civilian clothing, and driving unmarked vehicles. This made them difficult to identify as law enforcement—which may have been the point—but it also led to an unexpected side effect. Across the country, police began arresting people impersonating ICE agents, a spike that law enforcement experts attributed directly to the agency's own practices.</p>

<p>Federal courts found evidence that the agency was engaged in racial profiling, targeting people who appeared Hispanic for questioning regardless of other factors.</p>

<h2>The One Big Beautiful Bill</h2>

<p>On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation contained many provisions, but among the most consequential was its funding for ICE.</p>

<p>The numbers were unprecedented. The bill allocated more money to ICE than to any federal law enforcement agency in history—more than the FBI, more than the Drug Enforcement Administration, more even than the entire federal Bureau of Prisons. The funding covered detention facilities, deportation operations, and hiring thousands of new agents.</p>

<p>To attract recruits, ICE began offering extraordinary incentives: a fifty thousand dollar signing bonus for sworn police officers who joined, plus sixty thousand dollars in college loan forgiveness.</p>

<p>Critics warned that the expanded funding would enable mass detentions and deportations on a scale not seen before. Supporters argued it was simply providing resources to enforce existing laws.</p>

<p>By December 2025, ICE held 68,440 people in detention. Nearly 40,000 of them—more than half—had no criminal record or only pending charges that hadn't been adjudicated. Between January and December, the administration had arrested over 328,000 people and deported nearly 327,000.</p>

<h2>The Human Cost</h2>

<p>Numbers on this scale inevitably produce individual tragedies.</p>

<p>In July 2025, The Guardian published a report on what it called "Alligator Alcatraz"—ICE detention facilities in Florida. Based on interviews with detainees conducted by Human Rights Watch, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and Sanctuary of the South, the report documented a series of alleged abuses: people deprived of food, water, and showers. In the first months of the second Trump administration, several people died in ICE custody.</p>

<p>Detention conditions had been controversial for years. The facilities are a mix of dedicated ICE centers and county jails contracted to hold immigration detainees. Unlike criminal defendants, immigration detainees have no constitutional right to a public defender, and many navigate complex deportation proceedings without legal representation. Children have sometimes been separated from parents. People with serious medical conditions have not always received adequate care.</p>

<p>Defenders of the system argue that immigration detention is civil rather than criminal—people are being held pending administrative proceedings, not as punishment—and that most detainees are removed within a reasonable time. Critics respond that the distinction between civil and criminal detention means little to someone locked in a cell.</p>

<h2>Resistance and Violence</h2>

<p>The 2025 expansion sparked protests nationwide, culminating in large demonstrations in Los Angeles in June.</p>

<p>But resistance also took darker forms. In 2025, at least three notable attacks targeted ICE facilities in Texas. On July 4—the same day the One Big Beautiful Bill became law—a group attacked an ICE detention center in Alvarado. On August 25, a man was arrested at a Dallas ICE field office after claiming he had a bomb and displaying what he said was a detonator on his wrist. On September 24, a gunman on a nearby rooftop fired a rifle at a van at the Dallas field office, killing one detainee and critically injuring two others before turning the gun on himself. One of the wounded victims died six days later.</p>

<p>These attacks reflected a broader radicalization of sentiment around immigration enforcement. Public opinion polls showed that by July 2025, a majority of Americans disapproved of ICE—a higher level of public opposition than during the 2018 "Abolish ICE" movement. But the numbers also revealed deep partisan division: 72 percent of Republican supporters viewed the agency favorably, while 78 percent of Democratic supporters viewed it negatively.</p>

<h2>Internal Turmoil</h2>

<p>By November 2025, ICE's leadership was in chaos.</p>

<p>At least half of the agency's top officials had been fired or reassigned. Many were replaced with officers from Border Patrol—a different agency with a different culture and different methods. The Chicago Tribune reported that the shakeup reflected the administration's desire to increase deportations at any cost, noting that Border Patrol's approach was less targeted than ICE's traditional methods. Border Patrol officers were accustomed to stopping people near the border and asking about their citizenship status. Bringing that approach into the interior of the country—stopping random people on the street and demanding to know where they were born—represented a significant change.</p>

<p>The agency hasn't had a Senate-confirmed director since Sarah Saldaña stepped down on January 20, 2017—the day Trump first took office. As of late 2025, the acting director was Todd Lyons. This eight-year absence of confirmed leadership is itself remarkable, reflecting the politically toxic nature of the position.</p>

<h2>The Name They Call It</h2>

<p>In Spanish-speaking communities, ICE and its predecessor agencies have long been known by a single word: "la migra."</p>

<p>The term predates ICE itself—it was used for the Immigration and Naturalization Service too. It's not quite an acronym and not quite slang. It's simply what the immigration authority is called by the communities most directly affected by it.</p>

<p>There's something telling about this linguistic persistence. Agencies get reorganized, names change, letterheads are reprinted. But to the people who encounter immigration enforcement in their daily lives, it's all "la migra"—a continuous presence stretching back decades, regardless of which department it reports to or what its official mission statement says.</p>

<h2>What ICE Became</h2>

<p>Some critics describe ICE as a "civilian law enforcement paramilitary agency." That's a mouthful, but each word carries weight.</p>

<p>It's civilian—not military—but it increasingly operates alongside military forces. It's law enforcement—with badges and arrest powers—but it's focused on administrative violations rather than crimes. (Being present in the country without authorization is a civil violation, not a criminal offense, though illegal entry is a misdemeanor.) It's paramilitary in its tactics: the masks, the unmarked vehicles, the raids conducted in the early morning hours.</p>

<p>The agency enforces more than 400 federal statutes, covering customs violations, terrorism prevention, human trafficking, and of course immigration. Its workforce started Trump's second term at over 20,000 employees, with plans to add 10,000 more ICE agents plus thousands of National Guard troops and personnel borrowed from other federal agencies.</p>

<p>Whether this represents a necessary response to immigration challenges or a dangerous expansion of state power depends entirely on whom you ask. The polls suggest most Americans have made up their minds, in one direction or the other.</p>

<h2>The Unresolved Question</h2>

<p>Twenty-two years after its creation, ICE remains an agency at war with itself.</p>

<p>Its investigative arm wants to be the FBI of transnational crime—pursuing drug cartels and human traffickers with the respect and cooperation of law enforcement partners worldwide. Its enforcement arm has become the sharp edge of American immigration policy—feared by immigrant communities, celebrated by restrictionists, and deeply controversial across the political spectrum.</p>

<p>The two missions work against each other. The more visible and aggressive ERO becomes, the harder HSI's job gets. Local police departments decline to share intelligence. Foreign governments hesitate to cooperate. Witnesses refuse to come forward. The brand is poisoned.</p>

<p>In 2018, HSI's leaders asked to leave. They were told no.</p>

<p>Now, with unprecedented funding and an expanded mandate, ICE has become something that didn't exist before in American law enforcement—an agency with more resources than any other, focused primarily on a population that, by definition, cannot vote. Whether this makes America safer, more just, or simply more divided is a question that Americans are still arguing about.</p>

<p>In Spanish-speaking neighborhoods, they still just call it la migra. Some things don't change.</p>
