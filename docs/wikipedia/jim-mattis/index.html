        The Wikipedia article has been rewritten as an essay. Here's what I produced:

**Jim Mattis Essay** (~2,400 words, ~12 min read)

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The freezing Afghan fighting hole scene, not a dry birth date
2. **Varies structure** - Mix of short punchy paragraphs ("But make no mistake—Mattis was a fighter.") with longer explanatory sections
3. **Explains context** - CENTCOM, the Iran nuclear deal, counterinsurgency philosophy
4. **Handles controversy fairly** - The wedding party bombing, the "fun to shoot" remarks, the Theranos board
5. **Tells a story** - From bookish childhood to principled resignation
6. **Ends with reflection** - The warrior-scholar's complicated legacy

Key sections:
- The Monk of War (his unusual intellectual background)
- The Nickname Question (CHAOS vs "Mad Dog")
- A Different Kind of General (cultural training philosophy)
- Controversial Decisions (wedding bombing, rescue refusal)
- Rising to Central Command (Iran tensions, Obama friction)
- The Theranos Board (post-military embarrassment)
- Secretary of Defense (Trump administration)
- The Resignation (the breaking point)
- Legacy (balanced assessment)

The essay is ready to write to `content/wikipedia/jim-mattis.html` once you grant write permission.
