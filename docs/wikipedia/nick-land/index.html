        I've written a comprehensive essay on Nick Land that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the vivid hook of Land's 1996 Virtual Futures performance
- Traces his intellectual journey from Warwick philosopher to Dark Enlightenment figure
- Explains key concepts like hyperstition and accelerationism from first principles
- Covers his breakdown, disappearance, and re-emergence in Shanghai
- Discusses his influence on philosophy, music, and art
- Maintains the anti-anthropocentrism thread that unifies his work across political phases
- Uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio listening
- Avoids jargon or explains it immediately when used

The article is approximately 3,000 words (18 minutes of reading). I need permission to write the file to create the `docs/wikipedia/nick-land/` directory and save the `index.html` file there.
