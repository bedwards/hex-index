<p>Every eighty years or so, America tears itself apart and rebuilds from the rubble. At least, that's the claim.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, two amateur historians named William Strauss and Neil Howe proposed something audacious: that American history follows a predictable rhythm, cycling through four distinct eras roughly every eighty to ninety years. They called these eras "turnings," and they believed that by understanding this pattern, you could predict the future. The idea has since infiltrated business consulting, political strategy, and the worldview of at least one senior White House advisor. It has also been called "an elaborate historical horoscope."</p>

<p>So which is it?</p>

<h2>The Theory in a Nutshell</h2>

<p>Strauss and Howe argued that American history moves through a recurring cycle of four phases, each lasting about twenty-one years—roughly the length of one stage of human life. A full cycle, which they called a "saeculum" (borrowing a Latin term meaning both "a long human life" and "a natural century"), takes approximately eighty-five years to complete.</p>

<p>Think of it like the seasons.</p>

<p>The first phase is the "High"—a kind of springtime for society. Institutions are strong, confidence runs high, and collective purpose dominates. People pull together. The most recent American High, according to the theory, ran from the end of World War Two until President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. This was the era of suburban expansion, corporate loyalty, and the belief that America could do anything it set its mind to.</p>

<p>Then comes the "Awakening"—summer. Society has become so stable, so conformist, that people begin to suffocate. They rebel against institutions in favor of personal authenticity and spiritual exploration. The 1960s counterculture, the Jesus Movement, the rise of self-help and Eastern spirituality—these all belong to the Awakening that Strauss and Howe dated from roughly 1964 to the early 1980s.</p>

<p>The third phase is the "Unraveling"—autumn. Trust in institutions crumbles. Individualism flourishes. People stop believing in collective solutions and focus on their own lives. The authors identified the period from the Reagan era through the early 2000s as an Unraveling, an era defined by the long economic boom, the culture wars, and a deep cynicism about government and public institutions.</p>

<p>Finally comes the "Crisis"—winter. Something breaks. War, economic collapse, revolution. Society faces an existential threat and must rebuild its institutions from scratch. The previous Crisis, according to the theory, encompassed the Great Depression and World War Two. After the crisis passes, a new High begins, and the cycle starts again.</p>

<h2>Generations as the Engine of History</h2>

<p>Here's where the theory gets more interesting—and more controversial.</p>

<p>Strauss and Howe didn't just describe historical eras. They argued that generations are what drive the cycle. Each generation develops a distinct personality based on the era in which its members grew up, and those collective personalities determine what happens next.</p>

<p>The theory identifies four generational archetypes, each corresponding to a phase of the cycle:</p>

<p><strong>Prophets</strong> are born during a High. They grow up in an era of institutional confidence and collective purpose, but they come of age during an Awakening, leading the rebellion against that conformity. They become moralistic crusaders, focused on values and vision. The Baby Boomers are the most recent Prophet generation.</p>

<p><strong>Nomads</strong> are born during an Awakening. They grow up underprotected, as society focuses on adult self-discovery rather than child-rearing. They become pragmatic, cynical survivors—alienated from both the moralizing of the Prophets and the civic-mindedness of the generations that came before. Generation X is the most recent Nomad generation.</p>

<p><strong>Heroes</strong> are born during an Unraveling. They grow up overprotected and emerge as confident, team-oriented optimists who rebuild institutions during the Crisis. The so-called "Greatest Generation" (born roughly 1901 to 1924) was a Hero generation. Strauss and Howe predicted that Millennials would be Heroes too.</p>

<p><strong>Artists</strong> are born during a Crisis. They grow up oversheltered as society focuses all its energy on survival. They emerge as sensitive, conformist, and process-oriented—the facilitators and compromisers who smooth over tensions in the next High. The Silent Generation (born during the Depression and World War Two) fits this mold.</p>

<p>This cycle repeats endlessly, each generation shaped by the era of its childhood and then reshaping society as it moves into adulthood and leadership.</p>

<h2>Bold Predictions</h2>

<p>The theory made specific forecasts—some eerily prescient, others embarrassingly wrong.</p>

<p>In their 1997 book "The Fourth Turning," Strauss and Howe predicted that a major crisis would strike America around 2005, give or take a few years. They warned of possible scenarios: a global terrorist attack, a major financial collapse, or a severe pandemic. When the attacks of September 11, 2001, occurred, followed by the 2008 financial crisis, believers in the theory felt vindicated.</p>

<p>But the predictions about Millennials aged less gracefully.</p>

<p>Writing in 2000, Strauss and Howe described Millennials as fundamentally different from the "downbeat and alienated" Generation X. They painted Millennials as team-oriented, optimistic, civic-minded, and sexually conservative. They predicted Millennials would embrace traditional family values, reject the vulgarity of teen culture produced by their elders, and believe that sex should be saved for marriage.</p>

<p>This description now reads as almost comically off-base. Millennials are among the least religious and most politically progressive generations in American history. They've delayed marriage and childbearing to unprecedented degrees. They're not rebuilding the civic institutions of the 1950s—they're questioning whether those institutions ever deserved trust in the first place.</p>

<p>To be fair, Strauss and Howe later acknowledged that generational boundaries are fuzzy and that the speed of development can't be precisely predicted. They compared their cycles to seasons that might arrive early or late. But this flexibility makes the theory harder to disprove, which is part of why critics call it unfalsifiable.</p>

<h2>The Steve Bannon Connection</h2>

<p>In 2010, a documentary filmmaker named Steve Bannon released a film called "Generation Zero," which drew heavily on Strauss-Howe theory to explain the 2008 financial crisis. Bannon interviewed historian David Kaiser, who had worked with Strauss and Howe, and used the framework to argue that America was entering a Fourth Turning—a Crisis era that would destroy the old order and create a new one.</p>

<p>Seven years later, Bannon became Chief Strategist to President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>This connection alarmed many observers. Kaiser later said that Bannon had been "thinking about how to use [the theory] to achieve particular goals for quite a while." Journalists began publishing articles with headlines like "Steve Bannon's obsession with a dark theory of history should be worrisome."</p>

<p>The concern wasn't just that Bannon believed in a cyclical view of history. It was that he seemed to believe the Crisis was something to accelerate rather than avoid—that creative destruction was necessary to sweep away a corrupt establishment and make way for renewal. If you believe a crisis is both inevitable and ultimately beneficial, you might not try very hard to prevent one.</p>

<p>Whether Bannon actually holds this view, or whether the theory actually influenced administration policy, remains debated. But the episode illustrated how a quirky academic theory could escape the seminar room and enter the halls of power.</p>

<h2>Where Did This Come From?</h2>

<p>Strauss and Howe weren't professional historians. Strauss was a playwright and theater director; Howe was an economist and demographer. They met in Washington in the late 1980s and discovered they'd both been thinking about generational patterns. Their collaboration produced "Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069" in 1991—a sweeping narrative that traced American history as a succession of generational biographies stretching back to the colonial era.</p>

<p>The book drew on an eclectic mix of sources. The authors cited ancient historians like Polybius (a Greek who wrote about Rome's rise) and Ibn Khaldun (a fourteenth-century North African scholar who developed a cyclical theory of civilization). They invoked modern sociologists like Karl Mannheim, who wrote about how generational cohorts develop shared worldviews based on formative experiences.</p>

<p>The resulting theory was ambitious. Perhaps too ambitious.</p>

<p>Academic response was mixed at best. Some praised Strauss and Howe for their "bold and imaginative thesis." Many more criticized the theory as deterministic, unfalsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Historians pointed out that the generational archetypes were too neat, the periodization too arbitrary, and the pattern too conveniently applied to fit the data.</p>

<p>The most fundamental criticism was that Strauss and Howe treated generations as more important than other social categories like class, race, gender, or religion. A wealthy white Boomer and a poor Black Boomer may have been born in the same years, but did they really share a "generational personality"? The theory assumes that birth year creates a deeper bond than economic circumstances, life experiences, or cultural background.</p>

<h2>The Appeal and the Danger</h2>

<p>Despite academic skepticism, the theory found a devoted audience in business consulting, marketing, and management literature. Understanding generational differences seemed practically useful. If Millennials really were different from Gen X, companies needed to know how to recruit them, manage them, and sell to them.</p>

<p>The broader appeal is even simpler: the theory tells a good story.</p>

<p>Humans are pattern-seeking creatures. We find comfort in narratives that impose order on the chaos of history. The idea that American history follows predictable seasons—that winter always gives way to spring—is reassuring. It suggests that even our darkest crises are temporary, part of a larger cycle of renewal.</p>

<p>But this is also the theory's danger.</p>

<p>Cyclical theories of history can breed fatalism. If a crisis is inevitable, why bother trying to prevent it? If generational personalities are fixed by the circumstances of childhood, why hold individuals responsible for their choices? The theory can become an excuse for passivity or, worse, a justification for accelerating conflict in the belief that destruction is just a necessary prelude to rebuilding.</p>

<p>There's also the matter of what the theory excludes. By focusing on American and Anglo-Saxon history, Strauss and Howe largely ignored how immigrant communities, enslaved populations, and marginalized groups might experience these "turnings" differently. The confident "High" of the 1950s looked very different if you were Black in Mississippi than if you were white in Levittown.</p>

<h2>Useful or Not?</h2>

<p>So is there anything to this theory?</p>

<p>The weaker version of the claim—that generational cohorts share some common experiences and attitudes—is almost certainly true. People who grew up during the Depression had different assumptions about money than people who grew up during the prosperous 1990s. People who came of age with smartphones experience the world differently than people who grew up with rotary phones.</p>

<p>But the strong version of the claim—that these differences follow a predictable eighty-five-year pattern, cycling through four distinct archetypes and four distinct eras in an endless loop—is much harder to defend. The historical evidence is cherry-picked to fit the pattern. The predictions about specific generations often miss the mark. And the theory offers no mechanism to explain why this particular rhythm would persist across centuries of dramatic social, technological, and demographic change.</p>

<p>Perhaps the fairest assessment is that Strauss and Howe identified something real—the way that shared formative experiences create generational cohorts—and then vastly overreached in systematizing it. The theory is less a science than a metaphor, less a predictive model than a way of thinking about how the past might rhyme with the present.</p>

<p>As a metaphor, it can be illuminating. As a prediction, it should be taken with an entire shaker of salt.</p>

<h2>The Fourth Turning Is Here—Or Is It?</h2>

<p>In July 2023, Neil Howe (William Strauss having died in 2007) published a new book: "The Fourth Turning Is Here." The title reflects his belief that America entered its current Crisis era around 2008 and remains in it still. The coronavirus pandemic, political polarization, the January 6th insurrection—all fit the pattern of a society in turmoil, preparing to rebuild itself from scratch.</p>

<p>According to the theory, the Crisis should resolve sometime in the late 2020s or early 2030s, ushering in a new High characterized by institutional strength, collective purpose, and conformist social values. A new Hero generation (presumably Gen Z or whoever comes after) will take the reins, build new institutions, and enjoy the fruits of their collective effort—until their Prophet children grow up, get bored, and start the cycle of rebellion all over again.</p>

<p>Will this happen? The honest answer is that no one knows. The theory offers a lens for viewing current events, but lenses distort as well as clarify. History may rhyme, but it doesn't repeat—and even rhymes can be forced.</p>

<p>What seems clear is that the Strauss-Howe framework will continue to find believers, particularly among those who crave order in chaotic times. Whether that's wisdom or wishful thinking is something only time will tell.</p>
