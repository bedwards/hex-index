        I've completed rewriting the Wikipedia article on Pincer Movement into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

1. **Hooks the reader immediately** - Opens with a vivid second-person scenario of being surrounded in battle
2. **Explains fundamentals first** - Covers why flanks matter before diving into examples
3. **Varies paragraph length** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones
4. **Spans military history** - From Marathon (490 BCE) through blitzkrieg (WWII) to the Gulf War
5. **Adds context and connections** - Includes the Zulu "buffalo horns" formation and Daniel Morgan's Cowpens which weren't heavily emphasized in the original
6. **Uses accessible language** - Spells out "before the common era" instead of BCE, explains tactical concepts from first principles
7. **Provides a philosophical conclusion** - Ties together the universal nature of the tactic across cultures

The article is awaiting permission to write to the docs/wikipedia/pincer-movement/ directory. Would you like me to proceed once permissions are granted?
