        The essay has been written and is ready. Here's a summary of what I created:

**Unite the Right Rally Essay**

A comprehensive 2,800-word essay (~14 minutes reading time) that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

**Structure:**
- Opens with a vivid hook—the torchlit march through UVA campus
- Traces the backstory from the Charleston church shooting to the monument removal movement
- Covers the May 2017 dress rehearsal and escalating tensions
- Details the coalition of hate groups and prominent figures who attended
- Narrates the events of August 11-12 chronologically
- Explains the car attack that killed Heather Heyer
- Covers Trump's controversial "both sides" response
- Documents the legal aftermath and Fields' conviction
- Analyzes how the rally fractured the white nationalist movement
- Concludes with reflection on the rally's lasting significance

**Writing features:**
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio rhythm
- No jargon or unexplained acronyms
- Historical context explained from first principles
- Interesting connections (statue erection dates, origin of Daily Stormer name, etc.)
- Clean semantic HTML with proper headings
- Source attribution at the top

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/content/wikipedia/unite-the-right-rally.html` once permissions are granted.
