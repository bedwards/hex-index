        I've written the essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on illiberal democracy. The content is ready but I need permission to create the file at `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/illiberal-democracy/index.html`. 

The essay:
- Opens with Orbán's 2014 declaration as a hook rather than a dry definition
- Traces the historical evolution of "liberal" and "illiberal" from personal character traits to political terms
- Explains Zakaria's 1997 Foreign Affairs article that popularized the concept
- Covers how elections can paradoxically stabilize autocratic regimes (Gandhi's research, Mubarak's Egypt)
- Explores the populism-illiberalism connection through Mudde and Kaltwasser's work
- Discusses the "illiberal counter-revolution" described by Krastev and Holmes
- Distinguishes illiberalism from traditional conservatism
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for Speechify readability
- Uses semantic HTML markup throughout
