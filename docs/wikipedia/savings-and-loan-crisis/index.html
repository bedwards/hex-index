<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis">Wikipedia: Savings and loan crisis</a></p>

<p>In 1989, the United States government found itself doing something extraordinary: systematically dismantling over a thousand banks. Not because of war or revolution, but because of a cascade of bad decisions, perverse incentives, and outright fraud that had been building for nearly a decade. By the time the dust settled, American taxpayers would be on the hook for $124 billion—roughly $280 billion in today's money—making the savings and loan crisis one of the most expensive financial disasters in American history.</p>

<p>To understand how this happened, you first need to understand what a savings and loan association actually was.</p>

<h2>The Friendly Neighborhood Bank</h2>

<p>Savings and loan associations, often called thrifts, originated in the nineteenth century with a beautifully simple premise. A group of people in a community would pool their money together, and from that pool, members could borrow to buy homes. Think of it as a formalized version of neighbors helping neighbors—except with interest rates and paperwork.</p>

<p>By the mid-twentieth century, these thrifts had become pillars of American suburbia. They were the institutions that made homeownership possible for millions of families. Their business model was straightforward: accept deposits from savers, pay them a modest interest rate, and lend that money out as long-term mortgages at a slightly higher rate. The difference between what they paid depositors and what they earned on mortgages was their profit.</p>

<p>This worked magnificently for decades. The government actively encouraged it, viewing widespread homeownership as essential to social stability and the American Dream. Thrifts grew at over ten percent annually in the postwar years.</p>

<p>But there was a hidden fragility in this model.</p>

<h2>The Interest Rate Trap</h2>

<p>The whole system depended on one crucial assumption: that interest rates would remain relatively stable. Thrifts made their money on the spread between short-term deposit rates and long-term mortgage rates. If you're paying depositors three percent and earning six percent on thirty-year mortgages, you're doing fine.</p>

<p>Then came 1979.</p>

<p>Paul Volcker, the newly appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, faced an economy ravaged by inflation. Prices were rising at over thirteen percent annually—a disaster for anyone trying to plan for the future or maintain the value of their savings. Volcker's solution was brutal but effective: he dramatically raised interest rates, eventually pushing them above twenty percent.</p>

<p>This crushed inflation. It also crushed the savings and loan industry.</p>

<p>Here's the problem. Those thirty-year mortgages thrifts had issued in the 1960s and 1970s were at fixed rates of five or six percent. They couldn't change those terms—a deal is a deal. But suddenly, to keep depositors from fleeing to higher-yielding alternatives, thrifts had to pay twelve, fourteen, even sixteen percent on deposits.</p>

<p>Think about that arithmetic for a moment. You're earning six percent on your assets and paying fourteen percent on your liabilities. You're losing eight cents on every dollar, every year.</p>

<p>Couldn't they just sell those low-interest mortgages and reinvest? In theory, yes. In practice, who would buy a mortgage paying six percent when market rates were fourteen percent? Only at a steep discount—meaning thrifts would lock in massive losses the moment they sold.</p>

<p>By 1982, roughly a third of all savings and loan associations were technically insolvent. They owed more than they owned.</p>

<h2>The Deregulation Gamble</h2>

<p>Faced with an industry sliding toward mass bankruptcy, Congress made a fateful choice. Rather than let thrifts fail—which would have triggered billions in deposit insurance payouts—lawmakers decided to give them new powers to earn their way back to health.</p>

<p>The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 began the process, phasing out caps on deposit interest rates and expanding what thrifts could invest in. The Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1981 went further, allowing thrifts to make commercial real estate loans, issue adjustable-rate mortgages, and even invest directly in businesses.</p>

<p>The logic seemed reasonable. If thrifts were dying because their assets were locked in low-rate mortgages, let them diversify into higher-yielding investments. If they could earn more, they could afford to pay depositors more.</p>

<p>What no one anticipated was how dramatically this would change the character of the industry.</p>

<p>Before deregulation, running a thrift was boring. You evaluated families for home loans, maintained careful records, and earned modest but reliable returns. The people who ran thrifts were often community pillars, more interested in stability than growth.</p>

<p>After deregulation, thrifts could be casinos.</p>

<h2>The Texas Miracle (That Wasn't)</h2>

<p>Nowhere was the transformation more dramatic than in the American Southwest, particularly Texas. The region was booming with oil money. Real estate prices were climbing. And suddenly, thrifts could pour money into commercial development.</p>

<p>New thrifts sprang up almost overnight. Under the relaxed rules, entrepreneurs could start a thrift with as little as two million dollars in capital—and thanks to permissive leverage rules, turn that into over a billion dollars in assets within a year.</p>

<p>That's a leverage ratio of 650 to 1. For every dollar of their own money, they could lend out 650 dollars of depositors' money.</p>

<p>Why would depositors put their money in these aggressive new thrifts? Because of federal deposit insurance. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, known as the FSLIC (pronounced "fizz-lick"), guaranteed deposits up to $100,000. If the thrift failed, the government paid you back.</p>

<p>This created a perverse dynamic. Depositors had no reason to worry about whether their thrift was making sound loans—they were guaranteed either way. And thrift owners had every incentive to take enormous risks. If the gambles paid off, they got rich. If the gambles failed, the government absorbed the losses.</p>

<p>Economists call this moral hazard. It's what happens when someone is insulated from the consequences of their actions.</p>

<h2>When the Music Stopped</h2>

<p>Between 1980 and 1986, thrifts' holdings of traditional residential mortgages dropped from over eighty percent of their assets to less than sixty percent. The difference went into commercial real estate, construction loans, and speculative investments.</p>

<p>Then oil prices collapsed.</p>

<p>In 1986, the price of oil fell from $27 a barrel to $10. The Texas economy, built on oil prosperity, cratered. Commercial real estate values—all those office buildings and shopping centers that thrifts had financed—plummeted. Developers defaulted on their loans.</p>

<p>The thrifts that had concentrated their lending in the Southwest suddenly held portfolios of nearly worthless assets. And unlike the interest rate crisis of the early 1980s, there was no hope that market conditions would improve and save them. Those loans were never coming back.</p>

<p>The second wave of the crisis had begun.</p>

<h2>The Regulators Who Couldn't</h2>

<p>You might wonder where the bank examiners were during all this. The answer reveals one of the crisis's most troubling dimensions: the regulatory system was designed to fail.</p>

<p>Thrift supervision was a jurisdictional nightmare. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board conducted examinations, but supervisory authority resided in separate regional Federal Home Loan Banks. These regional banks were privately owned by the very institutions they were supposed to supervise—a staggering conflict of interest. Federal examiners often had poor working relationships with the private supervisors who were supposed to act on their findings.</p>

<p>Reports from examinations could take months to reach supervisors. By the time anyone with authority to act learned about problems, those problems had often metastasized.</p>

<p>The Reagan administration, ideologically committed to deregulation, made things worse. Between 1981 and 1984, examinations of thrifts dropped by twenty-six percent—even as the industry was growing and taking on unprecedented risks. Supervisory resources, measured per institution or per dollar of assets, shrank dramatically.</p>

<p>Edwin Gray, appointed by Reagan to head the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, initially embraced the deregulatory agenda. Then, in 1984, Empire Savings and Loan of Texas collapsed amid revelations of systematic fraud. Gray reversed course, spending his remaining years in office trying to increase examination resources and tighten regulations.</p>

<p>He was largely unsuccessful. The Reagan administration didn't support him. The thrift industry lobbied aggressively against him. And Congress, under pressure from thrift executives and their campaign contributions, refused to provide additional resources.</p>

<h2>Accounting as Fiction</h2>

<p>If you can't fix a problem, you can at least hide it. That became the implicit strategy of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as the crisis deepened.</p>

<p>Under pressure not to alarm the public or use taxpayer money, regulators adopted increasingly creative accounting standards. Net worth requirements—the amount of their own money thrifts had to have at stake—dropped from five percent in 1980 to three percent in 1982, with new thrifts sometimes required to hold even less.</p>

<p>More insidiously, regulators allowed thrifts to use "regulatory accounting principles" that bore little relationship to economic reality. Losses could be deferred rather than recognized. Intangible assets—essentially accounting fictions—could be counted as capital.</p>

<p>Consider "supervisory goodwill." When a healthy thrift acquired a failing one, regulators would allow the acquirer to book the difference between the failed thrift's assets and liabilities as an intangible asset. This goodwill could then count toward capital requirements, even though it represented nothing tangible.</p>

<p>The FSLIC encouraged these acquisitions because it lacked the money to pay depositors at failing thrifts. Better to have another thrift absorb the problem, even if that meant letting the acquirer operate with phantom capital.</p>

<p>By 1983, even under the lax accounting rules, ten percent of thrifts were technically insolvent. Under proper accounting standards (what accountants call Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP), the situation was far worse. Yet these zombie institutions were allowed to continue operating, making new loans, and accumulating losses that taxpayers would eventually have to cover.</p>

<h2>The Fraud Factor</h2>

<p>Where there's weak oversight and easy money, fraud follows. The savings and loan crisis produced some spectacular examples.</p>

<p>Charles Keating became the most notorious figure of the era. His Lincoln Savings and Loan grew from a small Arizona thrift into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise by investing in junk bonds, land speculation, and hotels. When regulators started investigating, Keating went on the offensive. He made political contributions to five U.S. senators—later dubbed the "Keating Five"—who then pressured regulators to back off.</p>

<p>Keating even managed to save Jim Wright, the Speaker of the House, from personal financial ruin through coordinated campaign contributions. Wright subsequently blocked regulatory actions against thrifts.</p>

<p>The fraud examiner William K. Black led the investigation into Keating's empire. He developed the concept of "control fraud"—the phenomenon where senior executives use their control of legitimate organizations to commit crimes, often with the active assistance of accountants and auditors who are willing to look the other way.</p>

<p>Lincoln Savings eventually collapsed in 1989 with $3.4 billion in losses. Keating went to prison, though only after years of legal battles.</p>

<p>But here's the crucial point: fraud was not the primary cause of the crisis.</p>

<p>Estimates of how many thrift failures involved fraud vary widely, from eleven percent to thirty-three percent depending on the study and definitions used. Even the higher estimates suggest that most failures resulted from legitimate, if spectacularly ill-advised, business decisions. The combination of high interest rates, deregulation, concentrated real estate exposure, and weak supervision was sufficient to create disaster without any criminal intent.</p>

<p>A Congressional Budget Office analysis in 1992 estimated that fraud accounted for somewhere between three and twenty-five percent of total losses, with most experts settling on ten to fifteen percent. That still means fraud cost taxpayers between sixteen and twenty-four billion dollars—a staggering sum, but a minority of the total damage.</p>

<h2>The Bill Comes Due</h2>

<p>By 1983, the FSLIC had roughly six billion dollars in reserves. Outstanding claims from already-failed thrifts totaled twenty-five billion. The deposit insurer was, for practical purposes, already insolvent—it just hadn't admitted it yet.</p>

<p>Attempts to recapitalize the FSLIC were perpetually too little, too late. Congress, reluctant to appropriate taxpayer money for bank bailouts, kept hoping the problem would resolve itself.</p>

<p>It didn't.</p>

<p>In March 1985, Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati collapsed after losing $540 million in a securities scam. Unlike most thrifts, Home State wasn't insured by the federal government but by a private state insurance program. That program promptly became insolvent. Ohio's governor declared the first bank holiday since the Great Depression—an emergency closure of banks to prevent panic withdrawals.</p>

<p>Two months later, Old Court Savings and Loan in Maryland failed under similar circumstances. The panic spread through Maryland's state-insured thrifts.</p>

<p>These state-level crises offered a preview of what would happen if confidence in the federal insurance system collapsed. They also demonstrated that the FSLIC's insolvency was no longer a secret that could be kept.</p>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>By February 1989, the situation had become untenable. Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, which fundamentally restructured thrift regulation.</p>

<p>The FSLIC was abolished. Its deposit insurance responsibilities transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which had always insured commercial banks. A new agency, the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), was created specifically to wind down insolvent thrifts—to sell their assets, pay their depositors, and close their doors.</p>

<p>The law also created the Office of Thrift Supervision to regulate surviving thrifts, imposed stricter capital requirements, and provided additional supervisory resources. The era of regulatory forbearance was officially over.</p>

<p>Between 1986 and 1995, regulators closed or otherwise resolved 1,043 thrift institutions holding $519 billion in assets. The Resolution Trust Corporation alone handled 747 failed thrifts with $394 billion in assets.</p>

<p>The final cost to taxpayers came to $123.8 billion, with an additional $29.1 billion absorbed by the surviving thrift industry through higher insurance premiums. In total, the crisis destroyed about $150 billion in wealth.</p>

<h2>What We Should Have Learned</h2>

<p>The savings and loan crisis offers several lessons that would prove tragically relevant two decades later during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<p>First, deposit insurance creates moral hazard. When depositors don't have to worry about whether their bank is making sound decisions, banks can take enormous risks with other people's money. This doesn't mean deposit insurance is a bad idea—bank runs are genuinely destructive—but it means insurance must be paired with robust supervision.</p>

<p>Second, deregulation without supervision is a recipe for disaster. Giving financial institutions new powers to take risks while simultaneously cutting examination resources is like removing guardrails from a highway while encouraging drivers to speed.</p>

<p>Third, regulatory forbearance makes problems worse, not better. Allowing insolvent institutions to continue operating in the hope they'll recover typically just increases eventual losses. The longer a zombie bank operates, the more depositors it attracts, and the more money taxpayers ultimately lose.</p>

<p>Fourth, concentrated exposure is dangerous. Thrifts that loaded up on Texas commercial real estate had essentially made a single massive bet on the regional economy. When that bet went wrong, nothing could save them.</p>

<p>Fifth, the political system has trouble dealing with slow-moving financial crises. Regulators knew by 1983 that the FSLIC was insolvent. Congress didn't act decisively until 1989. Six years of delay allowed the problem to roughly quadruple in size.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, the crisis revealed how easily the regulatory system could be captured by the industries it was supposed to oversee. Campaign contributions, lobbying, and revolving doors between industry and government all played roles in preventing effective supervision.</p>

<p>The savings and loan crisis was not an inevitable natural disaster. It was a man-made catastrophe, created by a series of decisions—each seemingly reasonable in isolation—that combined to produce financial devastation. Understanding how it happened is essential to preventing its recurrence.</p>

<p>Whether we've actually learned those lessons is, of course, another question entirely.</p>
