        I've written the essay on the ouroboros, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the paradox of self-consumption representing infinity
- Traces the symbol chronologically from Egyptian tombs through Gnosticism, alchemy, Norse mythology, and into modern science
- Includes the fascinating story of Kekulé's benzene discovery
- Explores appearances in Hindu traditions, cybernetics, and contemporary culture
- Closes with a meditation on why humans keep returning to this symbol across millennia

The piece is approximately 3,500 words (around 15-20 minutes of reading), uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio flow, and explains concepts from first principles without assuming prior knowledge.
