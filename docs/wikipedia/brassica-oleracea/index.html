        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Brassica oleracea. Here's the content I prepared:

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The surprising fact that kale, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and kohlrabi are all the same species
2. **Tells the story chronologically** - From wild ancestor to modern cultivars
3. **Varies paragraph and sentence length** - Creating rhythm suitable for text-to-speech
4. **Explains technical terms** - Like "biennial," "inflorescence," "haplotypes" in plain language
5. **Adds interesting connections** - The wolf-to-dog analogy, the cruciform flower naming, the ancient grape-cabbage feud
6. **Covers the genetics angle** - Including why some people genuinely taste Brussels sprouts as more bitter than others
7. **Ends philosophically** - Reflecting on the natural/artificial distinction

The article runs approximately 2,500 words, which should provide about 15-20 minutes of Speechify reading time.

However, I wasn't able to write the file to disk because the permission wasn't granted. Would you like to grant write permission so I can save this article?
