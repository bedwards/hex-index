        The article has been rewritten. The content is ready as an engaging, Speechify-optimized essay about frost that:

- Opens with a compelling hook about frost on windshields rather than a dry definition
- Varies sentence and paragraph length for natural audio rhythm
- Explains the science from first principles (deposition, dew point, supersaturation)
- Covers all frost types (hoar, window, advection, white, black) in accessible language
- Includes fascinating connections like the avalanche danger from surface hoar and the ice-nucleating bacteria Pseudomonas syringae
- Explains frost protection methods farmers use
- Ends with a poetic reflection that brings it back to the everyday experience

The essay is approximately 2,800 words (~14 minutes of reading), fitting well within the 10-30 minute target. It uses semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy and paragraph structure for Speechify compatibility.
