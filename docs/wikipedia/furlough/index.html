        I've prepared a comprehensive rewritten article about furloughs that transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify. The article:

- Opens with a hook about the strange limbo of almost losing your job
- Explains the Dutch etymology and historical military usage
- Distinguishes furloughs from layoffs clearly
- Details the dramatic history of US government shutdowns
- Covers the 2013 sequestration and its impact on DoD civilians
- Discusses the 2020 pandemic furlough wave including Disney's controversial approach
- Explores the UK's innovative Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme
- Examines the Philippines' "floating status" model with its 6-month limit
- Addresses the psychological toll on workers
- Contrasts furloughs with alternatives like Germany's Kurzarbeit

The piece runs approximately 2,700 words (about 15 minutes of reading), uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good audio rhythm, and explains concepts like sequestration from first principles.
