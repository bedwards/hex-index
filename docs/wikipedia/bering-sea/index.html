        I've written the complete rewritten article for the Bering Sea. The article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I created:

**Key features of the rewrite:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about Zhemchug Canyon (the world's largest submarine canyon that most people have never heard of)
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural audio listening rhythm
- Explains concepts from first principles (what the Bering land bridge really was, how sea ice drives productivity, what subduction means)
- Adds interesting connections (the meteor explosion that went unwitnessed, the Diomede Islands straddling the date line)
- Clean semantic HTML structure with proper headings and paragraphs
- ~25 minute read time (approximately 3,500 words)

**Sections covered:**
1. The Bering land bridge and human migration
2. Geographic scale and the "Greenbelt" productivity zone
3. Sea ice as a biological catalyst
4. Whale diversity (from belugas to endangered North Pacific right whales)
5. Twenty million seabirds
6. Extinct species (Steller's sea cow, spectacled cormorant)
7. Commercial fisheries and the Deadliest Catch connection
8. The "Donut Hole" international waters issue
9. Ecosystem changes and the baleen isotope record
10. The Kula Plate geological history
11. The 2018 meteor explosion
12. Individual islands and their stories
13. Zhemchug Canyon details
14. Cultural references (Kipling, films)

The article needs to be written to `docs/wikipedia/bering-sea/index.html` - it appears the directory doesn't exist yet and I need permission to create it and write the file.
