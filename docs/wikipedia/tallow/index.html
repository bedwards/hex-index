        I've written a comprehensive essay on tallow that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the dramatic Indian Mutiny hook to grab attention
- Explains tallow from first principles (what rendering means, triglyceride chemistry)
- Covers all major applications: candles, French fries, soap, steam engine lubrication, pemmican, aviation fuel, currency, printmaking, bell casting, and textiles
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Spells out technical terms (saponification, Fischer-Tropsch process)
- Adds historical context and interesting connections
- Addresses the modern "seed oil" debate objectively
- Closes by tying back to the opening theme

The content is ready to be written to `docs/wikipedia/tallow/index.html` once directory creation permissions are granted.
