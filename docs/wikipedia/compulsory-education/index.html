<p>The Aztecs beat everyone to it. Long before Prussia, long before Massachusetts, long before anyone in Europe had even conceived of the idea, the Aztec Triple Alliance—ruling central Mexico from 1428 to 1521—required every child to attend school. Boys and girls alike. This wasn't some elite academy for nobles. This was universal, compulsory education, centuries ahead of its time.</p>

<p>And then the Spanish arrived, and that system vanished into history.</p>

<h2>What Compulsory Education Actually Means</h2>

<p>The term "compulsory education" sounds straightforward, but it's worth unpacking. It means the government requires all children to receive an education during a specified period of their lives—typically starting around age five or six and ending somewhere between thirteen and eighteen, depending on the country.</p>

<p>But here's a subtle distinction that matters: compulsory education is not the same as compulsory schooling. Compulsory education means children must learn. Compulsory schooling means they must learn in a state-approved school building. Many countries allow homeschooling or alternative educational arrangements. Others insist on classroom attendance.</p>

<p>Today, nearly every nation on Earth has compulsory education laws. The exceptions are striking in their specificity: Bhutan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vatican City. That last one has a good excuse—it has no child citizens or residents.</p>

<h2>The Ancient Roots of a Modern Idea</h2>

<p>Plato gets the credit for planting the seed in Western minds. In <em>The Republic</em>, written around 380 BCE, he argued that an ideal city requires ideal citizens, and ideal citizens require ideal education. Everyone should be educated, he believed, because the state depends on it.</p>

<p>This idea lay relatively dormant for nearly two thousand years. Then the Renaissance rediscovered Plato. The Italian scholar Marsilio Ficino translated Plato's complete works into Latin in the fifteenth century, making them accessible to European intellectuals. By the time the Enlightenment arrived, Plato's educational ideas had become deeply influential. Jean-Jacques Rousseau, himself famous for writing about education, called <em>The Republic</em> "the finest, most beautiful work on education ever written."</p>

<p>But while Plato theorized, others had already acted.</p>

<h2>Sparta's Brutal Experiment</h2>

<p>Spartan education was compulsory in the most extreme sense imaginable. At age six or seven, boys were taken from their families and sent to military school. This wasn't optional. This wasn't a suggestion. The state claimed these children.</p>

<p>The training was harsh—brutal, really. For twelve or thirteen years, boys learned warfare, endurance, and obedience. At eighteen, they faced a comprehensive test of fitness, military ability, and leadership. Fail this test, and you lost your citizenship. You became a <em>perioidos</em>—a second-class resident with no political rights. Pass, and you continued military service until age sixty.</p>

<p>This wasn't education as we understand it. There was no mathematics curriculum, no literature classes, no preparation for civilian life. Sparta produced warriors, not scholars. The system worked magnificently for its intended purpose: Sparta fielded the most feared army in Greece. But it also produced a society that left almost no intellectual legacy and eventually collapsed under its own rigidity.</p>

<h2>An Ancient Tradition of Learning</h2>

<p>Jewish communities took a different path entirely. Parents in ancient Judea were always expected to teach their children, at minimum informally. But over centuries, this evolved into something more structured. Teachers called rabbis emerged in towns and villages.</p>

<p>According to the Talmud, a rabbi named Joshua ben Gamla transformed Jewish education in the first century CE. He established schools in every town and made formal education compulsory for children starting at age six to eight. This wasn't military training. This was literacy and religious study. The focus was on reading, understanding, and discussing texts.</p>

<p>This emphasis on universal literacy would become a defining characteristic of Jewish communities for the next two millennia—and would have profound effects when Jews encountered societies that had no such tradition.</p>

<h2>The Protestant Revolution in Education</h2>

<p>Martin Luther changed everything. In 1524, he published a letter addressed "To the Councillors of all Towns in German Countries" with a radical argument: every child—boys and girls—should be taught to read. His reasoning was religious: if salvation depended on understanding scripture, then everyone needed to read the Bible for themselves. No priest should stand between a believer and the word of God.</p>

<p>The practical implications were revolutionary. Luther wasn't proposing education for elites. He was proposing education for everyone.</p>

<p>The German states moved quickly. In 1559, the Duchy of Württemberg established compulsory education for boys. Then, in 1592, something unprecedented happened. The tiny Duchy of Palatine Zweibrücken—a territory so small you'd need a magnifying glass to find it on most maps—became the first government in world history to require education for both boys and girls.</p>

<p>Strasbourg followed in 1598. The idea was spreading.</p>

<h2>Scotland Gets There First</h2>

<p>Scotland often gets overlooked in these histories, but it achieved something remarkable. The School Establishment Act of 1616 required every parish to establish and fund a school. The Education Act of 1633 confirmed this and created a local tax to pay for it.</p>

<p>There were loopholes. Getting enough parishioners to agree to fund the school proved difficult—people tend to resist new taxes. But the Scots kept refining the system. The Education Act of 1696 established fines for non-compliance and authorized the government to directly implement schools where local resistance persisted.</p>

<p>This made Scotland the first country with a truly national system of compulsory education. While other territories had local experiments, Scotland created a comprehensive, enforceable, nationwide framework. The effects showed. Scotland produced a disproportionate number of Enlightenment thinkers, engineers, and scientists—a legacy often attributed to its early commitment to universal education.</p>

<h2>The Prussian Model That Conquered the World</h2>

<p>When people talk about the origins of modern compulsory education, they usually point to Prussia. The 1763 <em>Generallandschulreglement</em>—General School Regulation—issued by Frederick the Great established what became the template for most of the world.</p>

<p>The Prussian system was comprehensive and specific. Children from ages five to thirteen or fourteen, both boys and girls, would receive instruction in religion, singing, reading, and writing. The state provided approved textbooks. The curriculum was standardized.</p>

<p>The teachers were often former soldiers—a detail that tells you something about Prussian priorities. To supplement their meager pay, teachers were encouraged to cultivate silkworms. Education was important to the state, but not important enough to pay teachers well.</p>

<p>This system spread rapidly. Denmark-Norway adopted it. Sweden followed. So did Finland, Estonia, and Latvia (then part of the Russian Empire). Eventually England, Wales, and France came around too. The Prussian model became the default, and its influence persists in school systems worldwide. The age groupings, the standardized curricula, the emphasis on compliance and uniformity—these all trace back to eighteenth-century Prussia.</p>

<h2>Why Governments Really Want Everyone in School</h2>

<p>Here's where the story gets uncomfortable. Historians have noticed a pattern: compulsory education laws often appear in the aftermath of civil wars and social upheaval. A 2022 study found that non-democratic governments frequently introduced mass education specifically to teach obedience and respect for authority.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be entirely surprising. Governments rarely act from pure altruism. In Europe and Latin America, governments began intervening in primary education an average of 107 years before those countries became democracies. Compulsory education laws specifically came about 52 years before democratization on average.</p>

<p>Think about what this means. The people designing these education systems weren't democrats hoping to create informed citizens who would vote wisely. They were monarchs and autocrats hoping to create compliant subjects who would follow orders.</p>

<p>The Soviets were refreshingly honest about this. When they implemented compulsory education in 1930, the explicit goal was to "train a new generation of technically skilled and scientifically literate citizens" to serve the regime's Five Year Plans. Industrial development needed workers. Education produced workers. The motivations were economic and political, not humanitarian.</p>

<p>American education missions to the USSR in the 1950s came back impressed not by Soviet schools' commitment to human flourishing, but by their effectiveness at producing technically competent workers.</p>

<h2>The American Story</h2>

<p>The Pilgrims who landed at Plymouth in 1620 brought their Protestant convictions about literacy with them. They required parents to teach children to read and write—the religious imperative demanded it.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts School Laws of 1642, 1647, and 1648 are usually cited as the beginning of compulsory education in America. The 1647 law required every town with more than fifty families to hire a teacher, and every town with more than a hundred families to establish a grammar school.</p>

<p>But these were local mandates, not statewide requirements. Massachusetts didn't pass a true compulsory universal education law until 1852. The law was serious: parents who didn't send their children to school faced fines, and the government could remove children from families deemed "unfit to have the children educated properly."</p>

<p>Mississippi was the last state to fall into line, passing its compulsory attendance law in 1918—a full 66 years after Massachusetts.</p>

<p>An interesting legal challenge arose in Oregon in 1922. Voters passed a law requiring all children to attend <em>public</em> schools specifically—effectively banning private and religious education. The Supreme Court struck this down in <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</em>, ruling that "a child is not a mere creature of the state." Parents retained the right to choose private education. This established that compulsory education didn't mean compulsory public schooling.</p>

<h2>France's Peculiar Delay</h2>

<p>France, land of Enlightenment philosophy, was surprisingly slow to implement compulsory education. The obstacle was a bitter conflict between the secular state and the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The Guizot Law of 1833 required communes to provide education for boys and mandated religious and moral instruction. But education wasn't compulsory—it was merely available. The Jules Ferry Laws of 1881 and 1882 finally made primary education free and compulsory for both sexes until age thirteen.</p>

<p>The age limit crept upward over time: to fourteen in 1936, then to sixteen in 1959. This pattern repeated across most countries—initial compulsory education covered only young children, then gradually expanded to encompass more years of life.</p>

<h2>The Global Explosion</h2>

<p>UNESCO calculated in 2006 that over the following thirty years, more people would receive formal education than in all previous human history combined. Population growth plus universal compulsory education equals an unprecedented transformation in human experience.</p>

<p>China's story illustrates the challenges. The nine-year compulsory education system established in 1986 faced enormous obstacles: a massive population and a weak economic foundation. Initial implementation was spotty. But by 1999, primary schools served ninety percent of the national population, and junior middle schools served eighty-five percent.</p>

<p>The spread across the world happened in waves. The nineteenth century saw most of Europe and the Americas establish compulsory education. The twentieth century brought the rest of the world along. Japan in 1872. Thailand in 1921. India in 1930. Egypt in 1953. Indonesia in 1973. China in 1986.</p>

<h2>The Uncomfortable Question</h2>

<p>Does any of this actually work?</p>

<p>Research reveals a troubling disconnect. The correlation between a country's level of access to education and the actual skills of its student population is weak. Getting children into schools is not the same as teaching them anything.</p>

<p>This gap between education access and education quality might reflect weak capacity to implement education policies. Or it might reflect policymakers who simply don't know how to promote learning. Or—and this is the darkest possibility—governments might be providing education for reasons entirely unrelated to improving citizens' knowledge and skills.</p>

<p>Remember those statistics about compulsory education preceding democracy by decades? If the goal was always compliance rather than capability, then the failure to actually educate might be a feature, not a bug.</p>

<h2>The World as It Stands</h2>

<p>Today, compulsory education is nearly universal. The timeline of adoption tells an interesting story about global power and influence:</p>

<p>The Austro-Hungarian Empire introduced mandatory education across its territories—Austria, Hungary, and the Czech lands—in 1774. Tiny Liechtenstein followed in 1805. Greece in 1834. Japan in 1872. The Philippines under American military administration in 1901. Mexico in 1917. The Soviet Union in 1930.</p>

<p>Some stories stand out. Travancore, a kingdom in what is now India, established compulsory education in 1817—decades before most European countries. The Ottoman Empire followed in 1824. Namibia initially required education only for white children in 1906; the requirement wasn't extended to all children until 1990.</p>

<p>Afghanistan's history is particularly poignant. It introduced compulsory education in 1935. In 1996, the Taliban abolished compulsory education for women. The country has seesawed between inclusion and exclusion ever since.</p>

<h2>What It All Means</h2>

<p>Compulsory education represents one of humanity's largest collective experiments. We take children—all children, from every background, with every level of ability and interest—and require them to spend thousands of hours in institutional settings, following standardized curricula, under state supervision.</p>

<p>The intentions have always been mixed. Some proponents genuinely believed education would create better, freer, more capable people. Others wanted compliant workers and obedient citizens. Some wanted to integrate immigrants into unfamiliar societies. Others wanted to eliminate illiteracy for industrial efficiency.</p>

<p>The results have been similarly mixed. Literacy has become nearly universal in most countries. Technical skills have spread. But the gap between access and actual learning persists. Children attend school without necessarily learning much.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most honest assessment is that compulsory education has been enormously successful at achieving its primary goal: ensuring that virtually every child spends years of their life in state-supervised institutions. Whether those institutions effectively educate remains, after centuries of effort, an open question.</p>

<p>The Aztecs figured this out five hundred years ago. Plato theorized about it twenty-four hundred years ago. The Spartans took it to brutal extremes. The Prussians systematized it. The whole world adopted some version of it.</p>

<p>And still, we're not entirely sure we're doing it right.</p>
