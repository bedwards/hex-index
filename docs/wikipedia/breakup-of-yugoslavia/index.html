        <h1>Breakup of Yugoslavia</h1>

        <p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia">Wikipedia: Breakup of Yugoslavia</a></p>

<p>In 1980, Yugoslavia was the envy of much of Europe. Its citizens enjoyed free medical care, a 91 percent literacy rate, and a life expectancy of 72 years. The economy had been growing at over six percent annually for two decades. The country straddled the Cold War divide, belonging to neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact, and its president had helped found the Non-Aligned Movement—a coalition of nations that refused to pick sides between the superpowers.</p>

<p>Eleven years later, Yugoslavia no longer existed.</p>

<p>The story of how a prosperous, multiethnic federation tore itself apart into warring ethnic enclaves—leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced—is one of the defining tragedies of the twentieth century's final decade. It's also a story that defies simple explanations, braiding together ancient grievances, economic collapse, cynical politicians, and the dangerous vacuum left when a strongman dies.</p>

<h2>A Country Invented Twice</h2>

<p>Yugoslavia—the name means "Land of the South Slavs"—was essentially invented twice in the twentieth century, and both times the seams showed from the start.</p>

<p>The first Yugoslavia emerged from the wreckage of World War I in 1918, when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed and its South Slavic territories joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form a new nation. The problem was that the different groups had fundamentally different ideas about what this nation should be.</p>

<p>Serbs, who had been an independent kingdom before the war and had fought on the winning Allied side, tended to see the new country as essentially Greater Serbia—a reward for their sacrifices. Croats and Slovenes, who had been subjects of Austria-Hungary, imagined something more like Switzerland: a federation where each group would run its own affairs, united mainly for defense and trade.</p>

<p>The Serbs won this argument. They dominated the military, the police, and the government. Elections were marred by intimidation. When Croatian politicians objected too loudly, they were sometimes shot—literally. In 1928, a Serbian deputy opened fire in the National Assembly, killing the Croatian Peasant Party leader Stjepan Radić and two of his colleagues. The assassinations drew international condemnation, with figures including Albert Einstein signing protests organized by the Human Rights League.</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere of repression that the Ustaše formed. This Croatian separatist movement would eventually become a fascist organization so brutal that even the Nazis found them excessive.</p>

<h2>World War II: A War Within the War</h2>

<p>When the Axis powers invaded Yugoslavia in 1941, they didn't just conquer a country—they detonated its ethnic tensions. Germany and Italy carved up the territory, and in Croatia and Bosnia, they installed the Ustaše as rulers of a puppet state called the Independent State of Croatia.</p>

<p>What followed was genocide.</p>

<p>The Ustaše leadership announced a policy for dealing with the Serbian minority: one-third would be killed, one-third expelled, and one-third forcibly converted to Catholicism and absorbed into Croatian identity. They built concentration camps, the most notorious being Jasenovac, where tens of thousands perished. Serbs, Jews, and Roma were murdered with a brutality that shocked even German officers.</p>

<p>But the killing wasn't one-sided. Serbian royalist guerrillas called the Chetniks pursued their own campaign of ethnic violence against Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and the Sandžak region. Their plans, laid out in documents like the Moljević memo, called for creating an ethnically pure Greater Serbia through what they euphemistically termed "cleansing."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, various groups collaborated with the occupiers. The Germans recruited Bosnian Muslims into the Waffen-SS. In German-occupied Serbia, a collaborationist government under General Milan Nedić recruited Serbs into auxiliary units that worked alongside the Gestapo.</p>

<p>The one force that genuinely tried to bridge ethnic divisions was the Partisans—a communist-led resistance movement that recruited fighters from all of Yugoslavia's ethnic groups. They fought both the occupiers and the collaborators, and by war's end, they controlled the country.</p>

<p>The death toll was staggering. For decades, Yugoslav authorities claimed 1.7 million people died in the war. Detailed research in the 1980s revised this figure to around one million—still catastrophic for a country of fifteen million people. Somewhere between 330,000 and 390,000 ethnic Serbs perished in Croatia and Bosnia alone. At least 192,000 Croats and perhaps 100,000 Muslims died throughout Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>These numbers matter because they would be weaponized decades later. Every ethnic group could point to massacres committed against them—and massacres committed by others wearing their ethnic label. The wounds never fully healed; they were simply forbidden from being discussed.</p>

<h2>Tito's Balancing Act</h2>

<p>The man who built the second Yugoslavia from this wreckage was Josip Broz Tito, the Partisan commander who became the country's president for life. Tito was half-Croat, half-Slovene, married to a Serb—a walking symbol of Yugoslav unity. He was also a committed communist who broke with Stalin in 1948, making Yugoslavia the one communist state that wasn't a Soviet satellite.</p>

<p>Tito's Yugoslavia was organized as a federation of six republics: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia. The borders were drawn along rough ethnic and historical lines, though this was complicated by the fact that populations were thoroughly mixed in many areas. Within Serbia, two autonomous provinces were created: Vojvodina in the north, with its Hungarian and other minorities, and Kosovo in the south, with its Albanian majority.</p>

<p>The system worked, more or less, for thirty-five years. Tito suppressed nationalist movements ruthlessly—when Croats demanded more autonomy in 1971 in what became known as the Croatian Spring, he purged the reformers and tightened control. But he also prevented any single ethnic group from dominating the others. The federal government mediated disputes. The economy grew. People could travel freely to the West. For many Yugoslavs, it was the best period in their national history.</p>

<p>The cracks were always there, though. Economic development was wildly uneven. Slovenia and Croatia in the northwest were prosperous and increasingly Western-oriented. Kosovo in the southeast was desperately poor—its per capita income fell from 47 percent of the Yugoslav average right after the war to just 27 percent by the 1980s.</p>

<p>And always, beneath the surface, there was Kosovo.</p>

<h2>The Kosovo Problem</h2>

<p>To understand why Yugoslavia fell apart, you have to understand what Kosovo meant to different people.</p>

<p>For Serbs, Kosovo was sacred ground—the cradle of their civilization. It was there, on the Field of Blackbirds in 1389, that a Serbian army had been defeated by the Ottoman Turks in a battle that became the central myth of Serbian national identity. Medieval Serbian monasteries dotted the province. The Serbian Orthodox Church considered Kosovo its spiritual heartland.</p>

<p>The problem was that by the twentieth century, Serbs were a minority in Kosovo. Ethnic Albanians—Muslim, speaking a non-Slavic language, culturally distinct—made up around 90 percent of the population. They had their own grievances, their own aspirations. Some dreamed of uniting with neighboring Albania. Others simply wanted equal rights within Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>The 1974 constitution, Tito's last major reform, tried to address this by making Kosovo essentially self-governing. The province gained its own legislature, courts, police force, and—crucially—a seat on the rotating Yugoslav presidency. In most practical matters, Kosovo functioned like a republic, even though it technically remained part of Serbia.</p>

<p>This satisfied no one. Kosovo Albanians wanted full republic status, which would give them the theoretical right to secede. Serbs felt that their historic homeland was being slowly stripped from them, that they were becoming foreigners in their own ancestral territory. Albanian nationalists harassed the Serbian minority. Serbian nationalists demanded that the province be brought back under direct Serbian control.</p>

<p>In 1981, the year after Tito's death, Kosovo exploded. Albanian students protesting poor university conditions quickly escalated to demanding republic status. The protests were suppressed with tanks and thousands of arrests, but the underlying tensions only intensified.</p>

<h2>The Death of Tito and the Rise of Nationalism</h2>

<p>Tito died on May 4, 1980. The announcement went out on state broadcasts across the country, and with it ended what stability Yugoslavia had known.</p>

<p>In their book "Free to Choose," published that same year, economists Milton and Rose Friedman had predicted exactly this: "Once the aged Marshal Tito dies, Yugoslavia will experience political instability that may produce a reaction toward greater authoritarianism or, far less likely, a collapse of existing collectivist arrangements."</p>

<p>They were right, though even they couldn't have predicted how catastrophic the collapse would be.</p>

<p>The problem was structural. Tito's 1974 constitution had established a collective presidency that rotated annually among representatives of the six republics and two autonomous provinces. This was supposed to prevent any one group from dominating after Tito's death. In practice, it meant that Yugoslavia had a different president every year, none of them with enough time or authority to address the country's mounting problems.</p>

<p>And the problems were mounting.</p>

<p>The 1973 oil crisis had slowed the global economy, and Yugoslavia—which had been borrowing heavily from Western banks to fund development—found itself drowning in debt. By 1981, the country owed nearly $20 billion to the International Monetary Fund and other creditors. The IMF demanded austerity measures and market liberalization as conditions for continued loans. Unemployment hit one million. Living standards fell. The economic miracle was over.</p>

<p>Ethnic tensions and economic distress fed each other. The prosperous republics—Slovenia and Croatia—resented sending money to support the underdeveloped south. The poorer republics resented what they saw as northern arrogance. Everyone blamed the federal system, but for opposite reasons: Serbs thought it was too weak, while Croats and Slovenes thought it was too centralized.</p>

<h2>The Serbian Memorandum</h2>

<p>In 1986, a document leaked from the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts that would pour gasoline on these smoldering tensions. Known as the SANU Memorandum, it was never officially adopted, but its arguments spread rapidly through Serbian intellectual circles and eventually into mainstream politics.</p>

<p>The memorandum argued that Serbs had been systematically disadvantaged in Tito's Yugoslavia. It claimed that the 1974 constitution had "divided" Serbia by granting autonomy to Kosovo and Vojvodina. It described the treatment of Serbs in Kosovo as "genocide"—a loaded term given what had happened to Serbs during World War II. It suggested that the other republics had conspired to keep Serbia weak.</p>

<p>The document reflected genuine Serbian grievances, but it also provided an intellectual framework for what would become Serbian nationalism. The notion that Serbs were victims who needed to unite and fight back became increasingly powerful.</p>

<h2>Enter Milošević</h2>

<p>The man who rode this wave of nationalism to power was Slobodan Milošević. A communist party apparatchik with no particular history of nationalist sentiment, Milošević discovered in 1987 that ethnic grievance was a path to power.</p>

<p>The transformation happened at a public meeting in Kosovo Polje—near the famous battlefield—where Milošević had been sent to calm tensions between Serbs and the Albanian-run local government. When Serbs in the crowd complained of being beaten by police, Milošević reportedly said, "No one should dare to beat you." The phrase became famous. Here, finally, was a Serbian leader who would stand up for Serbs.</p>

<p>Milošević quickly consolidated power in Serbia, purging rivals and taking control of state media. He used mass rallies—the so-called "Anti-Bureaucratic Revolution"—to overthrow the governments of Vojvodina and Montenegro and install his allies. In 1989, he stripped Kosovo of its autonomy, sending in tanks to suppress Albanian protests. Hundreds of thousands of Serbs gathered at Kosovo Polje for the 600th anniversary of the famous battle, where Milošević gave a speech widely interpreted as a warning that Serbs were prepared to fight again.</p>

<p>To his supporters, Milošević was a hero defending Serbian interests. To his opponents—particularly in Slovenia and Croatia—he was a dangerous demagogue who was trying to dominate all of Yugoslavia through Serbian nationalism.</p>

<h2>The Unraveling</h2>

<p>The Communist system was collapsing across Eastern Europe in 1989. The Berlin Wall fell in November. By the end of 1990, every Eastern European country except Albania had held free elections and begun transitioning away from one-party rule.</p>

<p>Yugoslavia was swept up in this wave, but the outcome was different. When the six republics held their first multi-party elections in 1990, the communists lost almost everywhere—but they were replaced not by liberal democrats but by nationalist parties.</p>

<p>In Slovenia and Croatia, voters chose parties promising independence or at least radical decentralization. In Serbia and Montenegro, Milošević and his allies held on to power by wrapping themselves in nationalist rhetoric. In Bosnia, voters split almost perfectly along ethnic lines: Muslims voted for Muslim parties, Serbs for Serbian parties, Croats for Croatian parties.</p>

<p>At a federal level, the communist party simply dissolved. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which had held the country together for forty-five years, broke apart along republic lines in January 1990. There was now no institution that represented Yugoslavia as a whole.</p>

<p>The end came quickly after that. Slovenia declared independence on June 25, 1991, followed hours later by Croatia. The Yugoslav federal army tried to intervene in Slovenia but was quickly defeated in a ten-day war—Slovenia was ethnically homogeneous, relatively defensible, and the army's heart wasn't in it.</p>

<p>Croatia was a different matter. About 12 percent of Croatia's population was ethnically Serbian, concentrated in areas along the border with Bosnia. When Croatia declared independence, these Serbs—encouraged and armed by Milošević's government—refused to accept Croatian rule. They declared their own breakaway state, the Republic of Serbian Krajina. War erupted.</p>

<p>Germany, newly reunited and eager to assert itself on the European stage, pushed for international recognition of Croatian and Slovenian independence, which came in January 1992. But the recognition solved nothing. The status of Serbs in Croatia, and of Croats and Serbs in the ethnically mixed republic of Bosnia, remained unresolved.</p>

<h2>The Bosnian Catastrophe</h2>

<p>Bosnia and Herzegovina was Yugoslavia in miniature—a republic where no single ethnic group formed a majority. Muslims made up about 44 percent of the population, Serbs about 31 percent, and Croats about 17 percent. They lived in the same cities, worked in the same factories, intermarried. Sarajevo, the capital, was famous for its cosmopolitan mix of mosques, churches, and synagogues.</p>

<p>When Bosnia declared independence in April 1992—following a referendum boycotted by most Serbs—the country immediately descended into the most brutal war in Europe since 1945.</p>

<p>Bosnian Serb forces, backed by the Yugoslav army and Milošević's Serbia, launched a campaign of ethnic cleansing aimed at creating a contiguous Serbian territory that could eventually unite with Serbia. Muslim and Croat civilians were driven from their homes, murdered, or imprisoned in concentration camps. The siege of Sarajevo lasted nearly four years, with snipers shooting civilians in the streets. At Srebrenica in July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces massacred more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys—the worst mass killing in Europe since the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Croatian forces, meanwhile, pursued their own ethnic cleansing campaigns against Muslims in parts of Bosnia they hoped to annex to Croatia. At times, Croats and Muslims fought each other even as both fought the Serbs.</p>

<p>The war killed approximately 100,000 people, displaced two million, and destroyed much of Bosnia's infrastructure and economy. It ended only in 1995, when NATO finally intervened with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, and American diplomats forced all parties to the negotiating table at Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<h2>The Final Chapter: Kosovo Again</h2>

<p>The Dayton Agreement ended the war in Bosnia but left Kosovo—where everything had really started—unresolved. Throughout the 1990s, Milošević maintained strict control over the province, while Kosovo Albanians organized a parallel society with their own schools, hospitals, and government operating outside Serbian authority.</p>

<p>By 1998, this tense coexistence had collapsed into open warfare. The Kosovo Liberation Army, an Albanian guerrilla movement, launched attacks on Serbian police and military targets. Serbian forces responded with a counterinsurgency campaign that drove hundreds of thousands of Albanian civilians from their homes.</p>

<p>In 1999, after peace negotiations failed, NATO launched a 78-day bombing campaign against Serbia—the first time the alliance had ever attacked a sovereign country. Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, which became an international protectorate. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence, which Serbia still refuses to recognize.</p>

<h2>Why Did It Happen?</h2>

<p>The historian Basil Davidson once wrote that "recourse to 'ethnicity' as an explanation is pseudo-scientific nonsense." He had a point. Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian Muslims speak essentially the same language. They lived together for decades under both Yugoslavias. Many families were ethnically mixed. The violence wasn't an inevitable eruption of ancient hatreds—it was manufactured, organized, and directed by political leaders who found nationalism useful.</p>

<p>But that's not the whole story either. The ethnic divisions were real, rooted in different religions (Orthodox Christianity, Catholicism, and Islam), different historical experiences, and different national myths. The wounds of World War II had never been properly addressed—Tito had simply forbidden discussion of them. Economic collapse discredited the communist system and left a void that nationalism filled. The federal institutions that had managed ethnic tensions for decades withered away.</p>

<p>And there were specific decisions by specific people. Milošević chose to inflame Serbian nationalism rather than pursue reform. Croatian president Franjo Tuđman chose to rehabilitate the Ustaše legacy in ways that terrified Croatian Serbs. Bosnian Serb leaders chose ethnic cleansing as a strategy. At every fork in the road, someone chose the path toward war.</p>

<p>The breakup of Yugoslavia is often cited as a cautionary tale about the dangers of nationalism, or the fragility of multiethnic states, or the importance of strong institutions. All of these lessons have some validity. But perhaps the most important lesson is simpler: societies that paper over historical trauma, that forbid honest discussion of past atrocities, that never pursue genuine reconciliation—such societies are building on foundations that can crack open at any moment.</p>

<p>Yugoslavia in 1980 looked stable and prosperous. By 1995, it was a synonym for ethnic slaughter. The transformation took just fifteen years.</p>
