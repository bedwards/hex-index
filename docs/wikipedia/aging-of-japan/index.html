<p>In 2014, something quietly remarkable happened in Japan: sales of adult diapers surpassed sales of baby diapers. This single statistic captures, perhaps better than any government report or academic paper, the extraordinary demographic transformation underway in the world's third-largest economy.</p>

<p>Japan isn't just getting older. It's becoming a kind of laboratory for humanity's future—a place where the consequences of longer lives and fewer births are playing out in real time, decades before most other nations will face the same challenges.</p>

<h2>The Numbers That Changed Everything</h2>

<p>Nearly three in ten Japanese people are now over 65 years old. By 2050, that figure will rise to one in three. No country in history has ever aged this quickly or this dramatically.</p>

<p>The transformation happened with startling speed. In 1974, about a quarter of Japan's population were children under 14. Today, that figure has been cut in half—just 12.8 percent. The elderly outnumbered children for the first time in 1997, and the gap has only widened since.</p>

<p>Economists at Tohoku University, perhaps with a dark sense of humor, created what they call a "countdown to national extinction." Based on current fertility trends, their model projects that Japan will have only one remaining child in the year 4205. The projection is obviously absurd as a literal prediction—no trend continues unchanged for two millennia—but it captures something real about the trajectory the country is on.</p>

<p>These numbers prompted Prime Minister Shinzō Abe to declare that Japan's population should not fall below 100 million. It currently stands at about 125 million, down from a peak of 128 million in 2008. Without significant changes, projections suggest it could drop to 87 million by 2060.</p>

<h2>The Triumph of Living Longer</h2>

<p>The story of Japan's aging isn't primarily a story of failure. It's partly a story of extraordinary success.</p>

<p>When World War II ended, the average Japanese woman could expect to live 54 years, and the average man just 50. Today, Japanese life expectancy stands at 85 years—81.7 for men and an astonishing 88.5 for women. This represents one of the most dramatic improvements in human longevity ever recorded.</p>

<p>What happened? Peace and prosperity, for starters. The post-war economic miracle didn't just make Japan rich; it made Japanese people healthier. Better nutrition, advanced medical care, improved living conditions, and a sophisticated pharmaceutical industry all contributed. The country developed one of the most comprehensive healthcare systems in the world.</p>

<p>On any given day in 2011, nearly 3 percent of Japanese people aged 75 to 79 were in a hospital, and more than 13 percent were visiting a doctor. The healthcare system that keeps people alive longer is also one of the most intensively used on Earth.</p>

<h2>Why the Babies Stopped Coming</h2>

<p>Japan had a baby boom after World War II, just like many other countries. Between 1947 and 1949, birth rates surged. Then they began a long, steady decline that continues to this day.</p>

<p>The total fertility rate—the average number of children born to each woman over her lifetime—needs to be about 2.1 for a population to replace itself without immigration. Japan's rate fell below that threshold in 1974 and kept falling. In 2005, it hit a historic low of 1.26 children per woman. It has recovered slightly since then, to about 1.41, but experts believe this uptick reflects timing shifts rather than any fundamental change in how many children Japanese families ultimately have.</p>

<p>The reasons are complex and interconnected. Later marriages, fewer marriages overall, higher education levels, urbanization, smaller living spaces, the high cost of raising children, and the difficulty of balancing work and family life all play a role.</p>

<p>But economics sits at the heart of the story.</p>

<h2>The Precarious Economy of Young Japan</h2>

<p>About 40 percent of Japan's workforce now holds what's called "non-regular" employment—part-time, temporary, or contract work without the security and benefits that defined the post-war Japanese economy. These workers earn, on average, 53 percent less than their regularly employed counterparts.</p>

<p>For young men especially, this economic precarity translates directly into lower marriage rates. Men with unstable employment are significantly less likely to marry, and in Japan's relatively traditional society, marriage remains the primary path to parenthood.</p>

<p>The exhaustion factor compounds the problem. Many young Japanese workers report that fatigue from overwork leaves them with little energy or motivation to pursue romantic relationships. Japan's notorious work culture—long hours, after-work socializing with colleagues, difficult commutes—squeezes out the time and energy that courtship requires.</p>

<p>The sociologist Masahiro Yamada coined a term for unmarried women in their late twenties and thirties who continue living with their parents: "parasite singles." The phrase carries judgment, but it also reflects economic reality. Housing is expensive, wages are stagnant, and the path to independent adulthood has become harder to navigate.</p>

<h2>The Retreat from Romance</h2>

<p>The changes in Japanese society go deeper than economics.</p>

<p>In 2015, one in ten Japanese adults in their thirties reported having no heterosexual sexual experience. A quarter of women and a similar proportion of men between 18 and 39 had never had sex at all—figures that have increased significantly since the 1990s. The correlation with economics is stark: men with stable jobs and good incomes are far more likely to be sexually active, while unemployed men are eight times more likely to be virgins than their employed peers.</p>

<p>A 2022 survey found that 40 percent of unmarried Japanese men in their twenties had never been on a date. Not a single one.</p>

<p>A 2010 survey introduced another striking concept: 61 percent of single Japanese men in their twenties, and 70 percent in their thirties, described themselves as "herbivore men"—a term suggesting passive disinterest in pursuing women or marriage. The metaphor contrasts them with "carnivore" men who actively hunt for relationships.</p>

<p>When the government asked single people about their attitudes toward marriage in 2022, only 46 percent said they wanted to get married. About a quarter explicitly preferred to remain single. The reasons they cited included loss of freedom, financial burden, and—particularly for women—the prospect of shouldering housework, childcare, and elder care while their husbands focused on work.</p>

<h2>The Care Crisis</h2>

<p>Traditional Japanese society expected adult children to care for their aging parents. The government still encourages what it calls <em>sansedai kazoku</em>—three-generation households where a married couple cares for both their children and their parents under one roof.</p>

<p>But this system is breaking down. Young people migrate to Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya for work. Women have entered the workforce in larger numbers. The costs of caring for dependents—both young and old—have risen. In 2015, nearly 178,000 people between ages 15 and 29 were serving as direct caregivers for elderly family members, a burden that shapes their entire young adult lives.</p>

<p>Japan has built about 6,000 special nursing homes caring for 420,000 elderly residents. But the demand for caregivers far outstrips the supply. Every year, the country closes 400 primary and secondary schools as the child population shrinks. Some of these abandoned schools are being converted into care centers for the elderly—a physical transformation that mirrors the demographic one.</p>

<p>The most haunting phenomenon has its own name: <em>kodoku-shi</em>, meaning "solitary death." Every year, thousands of elderly Japanese people die alone, their bodies undiscovered for days, weeks, or sometimes much longer. During the first half of 2024, police reported that over 37,000 people living alone were found dead in their homes. Seventy percent were over 65. Nearly 4,000 bodies were discovered more than a month after death, and 130 had remained unnoticed for at least a year.</p>

<h2>The Geography of Decline</h2>

<p>Japan's aging is not evenly distributed.</p>

<p>The Greater Tokyo Area is virtually the only part of the country still growing, and that growth comes almost entirely from internal migration—young people leaving rural and suburban areas for the capital. Between 2005 and 2010, 36 of Japan's 47 prefectures saw their populations shrink by as much as 5 percent.</p>

<p>The countryside is emptying out. In 2015, Japan had 8 million abandoned homes—houses left behind as their owners died or moved away, with no one willing or able to take them over. One analysis estimated that about half of Japan's municipalities could effectively disappear by 2040 as young people, especially young women, concentrate in a handful of major cities.</p>

<p>This creates political distortions. Electoral districts drawn for larger populations now represent far fewer voters, giving rural residents disproportionate influence in the National Diet, Japan's parliament. Some depopulated districts send three times as many representatives per voter as growing urban areas. In 2014, Japan's Supreme Court declared this disparity unconstitutional, but the ruling Liberal Democratic Party—which depends heavily on rural and elderly voters—has moved slowly to address it.</p>

<h2>The Economic Transformation</h2>

<p>In the early 1970s, spending on public pensions, healthcare, and welfare services for the elderly amounted to about 6 percent of Japan's national income. By 1992, that figure had tripled to 18 percent. By 2025, it's expected to reach 28 percent.</p>

<p>The dependency ratio tells the story starkly. This measure compares the population over 65 to those of working age, between 15 and 65. In 2014, this ratio stood at 40 percent—meaning there were roughly four elderly dependents for every ten working-age adults. By 2036, projections suggest this will rise to 60 percent. By 2060, it could approach 80 percent.</p>

<p>Japan's aging population helps explain why the country carries one of the highest public debts in the world—over 246 percent of its gross domestic product. Elderly voters, who make up an increasingly large share of the electorate, tend to oppose inflation, which erodes the value of their savings and fixed incomes. This political pressure may be one reason Japan has struggled to escape decades of economic stagnation and deflation.</p>

<p>Even the military faces consequences. The Japan Self-Defense Forces have encountered serious recruitment challenges as the pool of young people shrinks.</p>

<h2>Adaptations and Experiments</h2>

<p>Japan isn't simply watching its demographic transformation unfold. The country has become a testing ground for policies and technologies aimed at adapting to an older society.</p>

<p>In 2000, Japan introduced a universal long-term-care insurance system, one of the most ambitious programs of its kind anywhere in the world. The government has invested heavily in regenerative medicine and cell therapies, partly with the goal of keeping older workers productive longer. Many small and medium-sized businesses have experimented with ways to retain employees past traditional retirement ages.</p>

<p>The labor market has adapted out of necessity. At the end of 2015, there were 125 jobs for every 100 job seekers in Japan—a significant labor shortage by any measure. Companies that once relied on young workers have had to find ways to accommodate and attract older ones.</p>

<p>There's even a silver lining to the population decline itself. A smaller population could make Japan's notoriously crowded metropolitan areas more livable. Even if total economic output stagnates, a shrinking workforce might still see its share of prosperity grow.</p>

<h2>The View from Inside</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most striking thing about Japan's demographic transformation is how little alarm it generates among ordinary Japanese citizens.</p>

<p>Surveys consistently find that most Japanese people view their country as comfortable and modern. There is no widespread sense of crisis, no feeling that the nation is in decline or headed for catastrophe. People are aware of the aging population, certainly, but they do not experience it as an emergency requiring dramatic action.</p>

<p>This equanimity may reflect Japanese culture, which tends toward acceptance rather than anxiety. It may reflect the genuine improvements in quality of life that have accompanied the demographic shift. Or it may simply reflect the fact that slow-moving changes, even profound ones, are hard to feel as urgent.</p>

<h2>A Preview of the Future</h2>

<p>Japan's experience matters far beyond its borders because other countries are following the same path, just a few decades behind.</p>

<p>South Korea's fertility rate has already fallen below Japan's, dropping to levels that would have seemed unimaginable a generation ago. China, with its legacy of the one-child policy, faces its own aging crisis. European countries, from Italy to Germany, grapple with similar dynamics. Even the United States, which has historically relied on immigration to offset low native birth rates, is not immune to these pressures.</p>

<p>What Japan discovers about maintaining economic vitality, caring for the elderly, sustaining social cohesion, and adapting institutions to a radically different age structure will offer lessons—both positive and cautionary—for much of humanity.</p>

<p>The country that pioneered so many innovations of the modern world—from bullet trains to consumer electronics to manufacturing techniques that transformed global industry—is now pioneering something else: the first truly comprehensive experiment in what happens when a wealthy, technologically advanced society grows old together.</p>

<p>Whether this proves to be a triumph of adaptation or a cautionary tale of decline, the world will be watching. And learning.</p>
