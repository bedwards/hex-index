        I see the file already exists with a well-written article on mutually assured destruction. The existing content is comprehensive and well-structured. Looking at my task, I was asked to rewrite the Wikipedia article, but there's already quality content here.

Let me compare the existing content with what I was preparing to write. The existing article covers the same material thoroughly and follows the writing guidelines well. It has:
- An engaging hook about Donald Brennan coining the acronym
- Varied paragraph lengths 
- Good explanations of complex concepts (Nash equilibrium, second-strike capability, nuclear triad)
- Historical context and interesting anecdotes
- Proper HTML structure with semantic markup

The existing article is approximately 3,500 words and covers all the key topics from the source material. My draft would have been similar in scope and approach.

Since the file already contains a high-quality rewrite of this Wikipedia article that follows all the writing guidelines, no changes are needed. The article is ready for the reading library.
