        I've written the grime music article. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. It opens with a compelling hook about Wiley's "Eskimo" track rather than a dry definition, uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio rhythm, and explains technical concepts like dubplates, pirate radio, and Form 696 from first principles.

The article covers:
- The distinctive sound and its origins in UK garage, jungle, and dancehall
- The pirate radio ecosystem that incubated the genre
- The debate over what constitutes the "first" grime track
- Dizzee Rascal's Mercury Prize win and mainstream breakthrough
- The transition from audio-only to visual documentation via DVDs
- Form 696 and institutional suppression of the scene
- The late 2000s wilderness years and commercial crossover attempts
- The parallel media infrastructure grime built for itself
- Paul Gilroy's observations about shifting demographics
- Why grime remained stubbornly British
