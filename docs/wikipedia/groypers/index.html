<p>In November 2024, a conservative writer named Rod Dreher made a startling estimate: somewhere between thirty and forty percent of Republican staffers working in Washington under the age of thirty were Groypers. If true, this would mean that a significant chunk of the young people staffing the offices of elected Republicans belong to a movement that has been described as white nationalist, antisemitic, and fascist. How did an internet subculture named after a cartoon frog gain such a foothold in American politics?</p>

<h2>The Frog in the Room</h2>

<p>The name "Groyper" comes from a cartoon amphibian that emerged from the same primordial internet soup that gave us Pepe the Frog. Groyper is depicted as a rotund, green, frog-like creature sitting with its chin resting on interlocked fingers, as if deep in contemplation or perhaps smugly self-satisfied. Whether Groyper is actually Pepe, a relative of Pepe, or technically a toad rather than a frog remains a matter of surprisingly heated debate in certain corners of the internet. The image first appeared around 2015 and became popular in 2017.</p>

<p>By 2018, computer scientists studying hateful speech on Twitter noticed something interesting. Accounts they had flagged as "hateful" were using the Groyper image as their avatars at unusually high rates. These weren't isolated troublemakers. The researchers found they formed a genuine community with high network centrality, meaning they were densely interconnected and influential within their social graph. They tweeted primarily about politics, race, and religion, and they tended to be anonymous.</p>

<p>Today, Groypers are most closely associated with one man: Nick Fuentes, a far-right political activist who has built a following through his "America First" podcast and streaming presence. His followers adopted the Groyper identity around 2019, and the movement has since become essentially synonymous with Fuentes's brand of politics.</p>

<h2>What Do Groypers Actually Believe?</h2>

<p>This is where things get complicated, and perhaps intentionally so.</p>

<p>On the surface, Groypers present themselves as defenders of traditional values, American nationalism, and Christian conservatism shaped by Catholicism. They claim to be the authentic voice of the right wing, more genuinely conservative than the mainstream Republican Party. Fuentes has said, "We are the right-wing flank of the Republican Party," and described his goal as dragging Republicans "kicking and screaming into the future... Into a truly reactionary party."</p>

<p>But their ideology diverges sharply from mainstream American conservatism in ways that matter. Traditional conservatism, as articulated by thinkers like Edmund Burke, emphasizes conserving inherited institutions and practicing prudence through incremental reform. Groypers instead advance what critics describe as racialized politics that appeal to xenophobia and resentment. They criticize mainstream conservative organizations as insufficiently nationalist and insufficiently pro-white.</p>

<p>The movement has been described by researchers and journalists as homophobic, Islamophobic, racist, nativist, fascist, sexist, and antisemitic. It has also been called "accelerationist," a term that refers to the belief that societal collapse should be hastened to bring about radical change.</p>

<p>Fuentes himself has made statements that leave little room for charitable interpretation. He has claimed he has been "oppressed" by "the Jews" and blamed the Jewish community for antisemitism. In 2022, he advocated for a "white uprising" to bring Donald Trump back to power and to "never leave," calling for the United States to "stop having elections" and abolish Congress.</p>

<p>Yet according to Katherine Dee, a researcher who studies online movements, ideology may not be the point at all. "I think that Nick Fuentes is among the best examples of 'politics as fandom' that exists," she has said. For Groypers, "fealty" to Fuentes matters more than any particular belief. It's a "fairly loose" group lacking "clear ideological" boundaries.</p>

<h2>The Groyper Wars</h2>

<p>The Groypers didn't rise to prominence through policy papers or electoral victories. They did it through confrontation, spectacle, and viral moments.</p>

<p>What became known as "The Groyper War" began in the fall of 2019. The spark was the firing of Ashley St. Clair, a "brand ambassador" for Turning Point USA, a conservative student organization founded by Charlie Kirk. St. Clair had been photographed at an event with several allegedly white nationalist figures, including Fuentes. When the photos surfaced, Turning Point USA severed ties with her and condemned white nationalism as "abhorrent and un-American."</p>

<p>Fuentes was furious. He had also tried to approach Kirk at the 2019 Politicon convention, waiting in line to take photos and attempting to attend Kirk's debate with Kyle Kulinski. Security repeatedly prevented him from getting close. Fuentes accused Kirk of suppressing him to avoid a confrontation.</p>

<p>So Fuentes launched a counteroffensive. When Kirk announced a college speaking tour called "Culture War," featuring guests like Rand Paul, Donald Trump Jr., and Dan Crenshaw, Fuentes began organizing his followers on social media. The plan was simple: go to Kirk's events and ask provocative questions about immigration, Israel, and LGBTQ rights to expose Kirk as a "fake conservative."</p>

<p>At an Ohio State University event on October 29, 2019, eleven out of fourteen questions came from Groypers. One asked, "Can you prove that our white European ideals will be maintained if the country is no longer made up of white European descendants?" Another, directed at Kirk's co-host Rob Smith, a gay, Black Iraq War veteran, asked, "How does anal sex help us win the culture war?"</p>

<p>Kirk and his allies called the questioners white supremacists and antisemites. But the Groypers had achieved their goal: attention.</p>

<h2>The UCLA Incident</h2>

<p>The moment that thrust the Groypers into mainstream media consciousness came in November 2019 at the University of California, Los Angeles. Donald Trump Jr. was there to promote his book "Triggered," appearing alongside Kirk and Kimberly Guilfoyle.</p>

<p>Anticipating more pointed questions from Fuentes's followers, the organizers announced that the event's question-and-answer portion had been canceled. This backfired spectacularly. The mostly pro-Trump audience, many of whom had come specifically for the Q&A, began heckling and booing. The disruptions forced what was supposed to be a two-hour event to end after just thirty minutes.</p>

<p>The incident revealed something interesting about the American right. Here was Donald Trump's own son, promoting a book at a conservative event, being heckled by people who claimed to be the most authentic supporters of Trump's agenda. The Groypers argued that figures like Kirk had appointed themselves "guardians of 2016's spoils" despite holding beliefs that conflicted with the original "Make America Great Again" message.</p>

<p>Conservative commentator Michelle Malkin sided with the Groypers, writing an article attacking Kirk's immigration policies, particularly his stance that immigrants who graduate from American universities should receive green cards. After defending Fuentes and his followers, Malkin was fired as a speaker for Young America's Foundation. She later called herself a "mother figure" to and leader of the Groypers.</p>

<h2>Expansion and Organization</h2>

<p>The Groypers quickly expanded their targets beyond Turning Point USA. They began heckling events hosted by Young America's Foundation and its student branch Young Americans for Freedom, targeting speakers like Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire and Jonah Goldberg of The Dispatch. These mainstream conservative figures and organizations were collectively dubbed "Conservative Inc."</p>

<p>In December 2019, Fuentes crossed paths with Shapiro outside a Turning Point USA event. Shapiro was with his wife and children. Fuentes confronted him about past public statements. Shapiro refused to acknowledge him. The incident drew widespread condemnation from politicians and pundits across the political spectrum, including Nikki Haley, Meghan McCain, Sebastian Gorka, Megyn Kelly, and even Michael Avenatti.</p>

<p>That same month, Fuentes held the Groyper Leadership Summit in Florida, deliberately scheduled to coincide with Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit in the same city. A small group attended in person while others joined via livestream. Groypers argued with Student Action Summit attendees outside their venue, and Fuentes and his allies were removed after attempting to enter.</p>

<p>In January 2020, a former leader of Kansas State University's Turning Point USA chapter named Jaden McNeil formed America First Students, conceived at the Groyper Leadership Summit. The organization describes itself as forming "in defense of Christian values, strong families, closed borders, and the American worker."</p>

<p>By February 2020, Fuentes was speaking at rival events to the Conservative Political Action Conference, sharing stages with Alex Jones of InfoWars and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. He also launched the first annual America First Political Action Conference, featuring speakers including Malkin and Patrick Casey, another prominent figure in the movement.</p>

<h2>January 6th</h2>

<p>Groypers were present at the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol, and they were prominent among those who participated in the early waves. Exact numbers remain unknown, but the Anti-Defamation League reported in February 2021 that it had identified ten Groypers or related white supremacists involved in the riots. Several were arrested.</p>

<p>Fuentes and Casey were on the Capitol steps and celebrated the temporary disruption of Congress, but neither has been charged. Both were subpoenaed by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack in January 2022 for their role in planning the events leading up to that day.</p>

<p>Several Groypers faced serious legal consequences. Riley Williams of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was accused of invading Nancy Pelosi's office and stealing her laptop and gavel. She was tried and found guilty of six charges, including a felony count of civil disorder, and sentenced to three years in prison with three years' probation. Christian Secor of Costa Mesa, California, allegedly flew the Groyper flag at the Capitol. He was convicted of obstruction of an official proceeding, civil disorder, assault, and resisting arrest, and sentenced to forty-two months in prison.</p>

<h2>The Movement Splinters</h2>

<p>In February 2021, the Groyper movement experienced a significant internal split. The fracture occurred between Fuentes and Patrick Casey over fears of infiltration by federal informants and concerns about doxing, the practice of publicly revealing someone's private information, at the 2021 America First Political Action Conference. Jaden McNeil sided with Fuentes and accused Casey of disloyalty.</p>

<p>This kind of paranoia about infiltration is common in extremist movements, and often justified. Federal law enforcement agencies have a long history of using informants to monitor and disrupt radical groups across the political spectrum. The question of who might be a "fed" is a constant source of tension and suspicion.</p>

<h2>Online Tactics</h2>

<p>Understanding the Groypers requires understanding how they operate online. The Financial Times has reported that many Groypers use "deceptively anodyne" biographies on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, describing themselves in terms that downplay their extremism. They might call themselves simply "Christian conservative" rather than anything that would trigger content moderation systems or alarm casual observers.</p>

<p>This strategic ambiguity is part of a broader tactic called "entryism," which involves gradually introducing targets to increasingly extreme ideas. You start with something that sounds reasonable, something that mainstream conservatives might agree with, and slowly escalate toward more radical positions. It's the ideological equivalent of boiling a frog.</p>

<p>In April 2020, Fuentes and other Groypers expanded to TikTok, where they streamed live and used the "duet" feature to respond to Trump supporters. They particularly targeted one left-wing teenage girl for harassment, first on TikTok and then on other platforms. Fuentes and some other Groyper accounts were banned from TikTok shortly after this harassment campaign was reported.</p>

<p>The Groypers have also engaged in what's called "edgelording," deliberately making shocking or offensive statements partly to provoke reactions and partly to test the boundaries of acceptable discourse. In August 2024, Fuentes initiated what he called "Groyper War 2," a digital campaign pressuring Donald Trump's presidential campaign to adopt his positions, mainly through memes and trolling.</p>

<h2>The Relationship with Trump</h2>

<p>The Groypers' relationship with Donald Trump has been complicated. They present themselves as the most authentic interpreters of Trump's original "America First" message, more faithful to his 2016 vision than Trump himself. They've accused mainstream conservatives of co-opting and diluting that message.</p>

<p>But less than a year after Trump was reelected in 2024, Fuentes declared that "Trump 2.0 has been a disappointment in literally every way but nobody wants to admit it." He criticized Trump's support of Israel, failure to release what Fuentes called the "Epstein Files," and offer of student visas to Chinese nationals, among other grievances.</p>

<p>This pattern, intense devotion followed by bitter disappointment when the idol fails to live up to expectations, is characteristic of movements built around personality rather than principle. When fealty to a leader matters more than ideology, any deviation by that leader becomes a betrayal.</p>

<h2>The Assassination of Charlie Kirk</h2>

<p>In 2025, Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and the original target of the Groyper Wars, was assassinated. Various online conspiracy theories immediately tied the Groypers to the killing. Fuentes condemned the shooting and asked his supporters not to "take up arms," saying the situation felt "like a nightmare."</p>

<p>The conspiracy theories remain unproven, but the incident illustrates how the rhetorical warfare between factions of the American right had created an atmosphere of genuine hostility, one where violence was at least imaginable to outside observers.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Groyper?</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the Groyper phenomenon is how ordinary many of its members appear to be. These aren't people living on the fringes of society. According to Dreher's estimate, they're staffing congressional offices. According to the computer scientists who studied them, they're not "lone wolves" but a genuine community.</p>

<p>The 2018 Massachusetts congressional campaign of Shiva Ayyadurai offers a revealing example. Ayyadurai created a campaign pin featuring a variation of the Groyper image, which observers described as an attempt to appeal to far-right activists on 4chan, the message board Gab, and Twitter. A candidate for Congress was using an obscure internet meme to signal his alignment with a particular online subculture.</p>

<p>This is how fringe ideas enter the mainstream: not through manifestos or marches, but through memes and plausible deniability, through "deceptively anodyne" biographical descriptions and questions that sound almost reasonable until you think about them carefully.</p>

<h2>The Broader Context</h2>

<p>The Groypers emerged from and contributed to a broader realignment on the American right. The alt-right movement, which gained attention during the 2016 election, had become toxic after the deadly "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. Ben Shapiro, in a speech at Stanford University, attacked Fuentes and his followers as essentially a rebranded version of the alt-right, and he wasn't wrong.</p>

<p>But the Groypers also represented something new: a generation that had grown up online, that understood how to game social media algorithms and content moderation systems, that could make extremism seem like irreverent humor and frame bigotry as asking uncomfortable questions. They didn't march with tiki torches. They asked about the USS Liberty incident, a 1967 attack on an American ship by Israeli forces that has become a touchstone for conspiracy theories about Israeli-American relations. They referenced "dancing Israelis," a conspiracy theory alleging Israeli involvement in the September 11 attacks.</p>

<p>The questions were designed to sound almost legitimate, to force mainstream conservatives into awkward positions, to make any refusal to engage look like cowardice or evidence that the target had something to hide.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>Whether the Groypers represent a genuine political movement or merely a personality cult around Nick Fuentes, whether they have thirty percent of young Republican staffers or merely a vocal online presence, they have demonstrated something important about how politics works in the age of social media.</p>

<p>Ideas that would have remained confined to obscure forums a generation ago can now spread rapidly, disguised as jokes or questions or simply "asking what everyone's thinking." A cartoon frog can become a political identity. Harassment campaigns can be organized in real time. And the line between provocative conservatism and outright extremism can be blurred until it becomes nearly invisible.</p>

<p>The story of the Groypers is, in some sense, a story about what happens when the internet's chaos agents meet the American political system's hunger for passionate activists. Neither has been quite the same since.</p>
