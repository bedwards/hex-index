        I've written a comprehensive essay about LIGA, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a vivid hook about building microscopic skyscrapers
- Explains the German acronym and the technique's nuclear origins
- Walks through why X-rays specifically are needed (parallel beams, deep penetration)
- Details how synchrotrons work in accessible terms
- Covers each step of the LIGA process: substrate preparation, photoresist application, masking, exposure, development, electroplating, and stripping
- Contrasts X-ray LIGA with the more accessible UV LIGA alternative
- Discusses the commercial applications from uranium enrichment nozzles to Swiss watch components
- Closes with reflections on why LIGA matters for advanced fabrication

The content is approximately 3,000 words, providing substantial reading material while remaining accessible for audio consumption through Speechify.
