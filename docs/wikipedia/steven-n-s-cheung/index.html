<h2>The Economist Who Impressed Milton Friedman in a Debate</h2>

<p>In the late 1960s, a young economist from Hong Kong walked into a room at the University of Chicago and did something remarkable: he argued with Milton Friedman and won. Or at least, he impressed Friedman so thoroughly that he was offered a job on the spot. That economist was Steven Cheung, and his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom—whether held by Nobel laureates or communist governments—would define his entire career.</p>

<p>Cheung represents something increasingly rare in modern economics: a thinker who refuses to hide behind mathematical complexity. While his peers filled journals with equations, Cheung insisted that economics should explain the real world using only two fundamental principles—that people try to do the best they can given their constraints, and that when something becomes more expensive, people buy less of it. Everything else, he argued, was either window dressing or obfuscation.</p>

<h2>From War-Torn Hong Kong to UCLA</h2>

<p>Steven Ng-Sheong Cheung was born in Hong Kong in 1935 to a family with roots in Huiyang, Guangdong—part of the Hakka people, a distinct cultural group within the broader Chinese population. The Hakka, whose name means "guest families," had a centuries-long history of migration and adaptation. This heritage of navigating between worlds would prove prescient.</p>

<p>When Cheung was six years old, the Japanese invaded Hong Kong. His family fled to mainland China, joining millions of refugees trying to survive the chaos of World War II in Asia. This early experience of upheaval, of seeing how quickly established order could collapse and how people adapted to survive, may have planted the seeds of his later interest in institutions and how they shape human behavior.</p>

<p>After the war, Cheung eventually made his way to the United States, enrolling at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1959. He spent eight years there, studying under two economists who would profoundly shape his thinking: Armen Alchian and Jack Hirshleifer. Both were associated with what's sometimes called the "UCLA tradition" in economics—an approach that emphasized property rights, transaction costs, and close attention to real-world institutions rather than abstract mathematical models.</p>

<h2>The Sharecropping Revolution</h2>

<p>Cheung's doctoral dissertation tackled a puzzle that had vexed economists for over a century: why does sharecropping exist?</p>

<p>To understand why this was a puzzle, you need to know what sharecropping is and why economists thought it was stupid. In a sharecropping arrangement, a farmer works someone else's land and splits the harvest with the landowner—typically giving up half of everything they produce. Economists going back to Adam Smith had argued this was an inefficient arrangement. Here's why: if you're keeping only half of what you grow, your incentive to work hard is cut in half. Why put in extra effort to grow more wheat if your landlord takes half of every additional bushel?</p>

<p>The "obvious" solution, from an economic standpoint, was either fixed rent (where the farmer pays a set amount and keeps everything above that, giving full incentive to produce) or wage labor (where workers are paid for their time and supervised directly). Yet sharecropping persisted across cultures and centuries. Were millions of farmers and landowners simply irrational?</p>

<p>Cheung said no. He argued that when you account for transaction costs—the costs of negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing agreements—sharecropping often made perfect sense.</p>

<p>Consider the alternatives. With wage labor, someone has to watch the workers to make sure they're actually working. That's expensive. With fixed rent, the farmer bears all the risk of a bad harvest—if drought destroys the crops, they still owe the same rent. Sharecropping splits the risk. If the harvest fails, both parties suffer proportionally. And because both have skin in the game, both have reasons to make sure the land is farmed well.</p>

<p>This insight—that seemingly "inefficient" arrangements might actually be clever solutions to problems we hadn't thought about—became a recurring theme in Cheung's work.</p>

<h2>The Fable of the Bees</h2>

<p>In 1973, Cheung published what might be his most delightful paper: "The Fable of the Bees: An Economic Investigation." The title is a play on a famous 1714 satirical work by Bernard Mandeville, but Cheung's investigation was into something quite literal: the business relationship between beekeepers and orchard owners.</p>

<p>Here's the background. Economists love to talk about "externalities"—effects that spill over from one person's activities onto others. The classic positive externality is bees pollinating apple trees. The beekeeper gets honey; the orchard owner gets pollinated apples. Everyone benefits! But since the beekeeper can't charge for pollination and the orchard owner can't charge for nectar, economists argued this was a market failure. The solution, they said, required government intervention—taxes and subsidies to align private incentives with social benefits.</p>

<p>Cheung did something revolutionary: he actually went and talked to beekeepers and orchard owners.</p>

<p>What he found demolished the standard economic story. There was no market failure at all. Beekeepers and orchard owners had been signing detailed contracts for years, sometimes centuries. These contracts specified exactly how many hives would be placed in which orchards, for how long, and at what price. Sometimes beekeepers paid orchard owners (when the nectar was particularly good for honey production). Sometimes orchard owners paid beekeepers (when they desperately needed pollination but the nectar wasn't valuable). The market had solved the "problem" that economists thought required government intervention.</p>

<p>The broader lesson was profound: what looks like market failure from an armchair might look very different when you actually observe how people solve their problems. As long as property rights are clear and people can negotiate, they often find ways to capture value that economists assume will be lost to externalities.</p>

<h2>What Is a Firm, Anyway?</h2>

<p>In 1983, Cheung published "The Contractual Nature of the Firm," a paper he later said he knew would be read a hundred years hence. According to legend, when he finished writing it, he "beheld the sky and laughed."</p>

<p>The question he tackled was deceptively simple: what is a company? Where does it begin and end?</p>

<p>This might seem like a silly question. A company is... a company. It has employees, offices, a name. But think harder. When you buy a coffee at Starbucks, you're interacting with the market—you pay money, you get coffee. When a Starbucks barista makes that coffee, they're operating within a firm—they don't negotiate the price of each espresso shot with their manager. But why are some activities coordinated through markets (you buying coffee) and others through hierarchies (the barista following corporate procedures)?</p>

<p>Ronald Coase, who would later win the Nobel Prize, had asked this question in 1937. His answer was that firms exist because markets are costly—finding prices, negotiating contracts, and enforcing agreements all take time and money. Sometimes it's cheaper to just hire people and tell them what to do.</p>

<p>Cheung pushed this further. He argued that a firm isn't really a distinct thing—it's just a particular kind of contractual arrangement that replaces the price mechanism with something else. The boundaries of a firm are blurry because they're just lines drawn wherever one type of contract gives way to another. A company isn't an entity so much as a bundle of contracts.</p>

<p>This might sound abstract, but it has practical implications. It suggests that governments, in some ways, are also firms—large contractual arrangements that replace market mechanisms in certain domains. And just as companies can be more or less efficient depending on their structure, so can governments. The question isn't "market versus government" but "which contractual arrangement minimizes the costs of getting things done?"</p>

<h2>The Red Guards and Personal Tragedy</h2>

<p>In 1969, Cheung published a peculiar article in the Journal of Political Economy titled "Irving Fisher and the Red Guards." Irving Fisher was a great American economist who developed foundational theories about capital and interest. The Red Guards were the fanatical young revolutionaries of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution, which was then tearing China apart.</p>

<p>The article appeared to be a darkly humorous piece arguing, with ironic detachment, that the Red Guards' destruction of property demonstrated a "refined concept of capital"—if you believe that bourgeois property has no value, then destroying it costs nothing!</p>

<p>What readers didn't know was that Cheung had written the article in anguish. His close friend Rong Guotuan—the first Chinese athlete to win a world championship in any sport, having taken the table tennis title in 1959—had just committed suicide. Rong had been targeted, persecuted, and tortured by Red Guards who accused him of being a spy. He hanged himself in 1968, one of countless victims of the Cultural Revolution.</p>

<p>The academic joke was gallows humor in the most literal sense.</p>

<h2>Friedman's Photographer and Friend</h2>

<p>Cheung maintained lifelong friendships with several giants of twentieth-century economics. Milton Friedman, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1976, actually officiated at Cheung's wedding. The two shared more than intellectual interests—Cheung was an avid photographer, and he took the portrait of Friedman that appeared on the cover of "Capitalism and Freedom," one of the most influential economics books of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Cheung accompanied Friedman on several trips to China, including a famous 1988 meeting with Zhao Ziyang, who was then the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao was the most reform-minded leader China had seen, and he was eager to learn from market economists. The meeting was part of a broader effort to understand how China might transition away from central planning.</p>

<p>Less than a year later, Zhao would be purged from power for showing sympathy to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square. He spent the remaining fifteen years of his life under house arrest. The economic reforms continued, eventually, but along a more controlled path than reformers like Zhao had envisioned.</p>

<h2>Returning to Hong Kong</h2>

<p>In 1982, after teaching at the University of Washington for thirteen years, Cheung made a surprising decision: he returned to Hong Kong to take a professorship at the University of Hong Kong. Ronald Coase and other friends encouraged him to go, believing he could support and influence China's economic reforms from there.</p>

<p>The timing was significant. Deng Xiaoping had begun opening China's economy in 1978, and the 1980s would see dramatic changes—special economic zones, private enterprise, foreign investment. Cheung threw himself into analyzing and commenting on these transformations, writing extensively in Chinese for a popular audience.</p>

<p>He also reformed Hong Kong's economics curriculum. Before Cheung, Hong Kong's A-level economics exam—the test that determined university admission—was fairly standard Keynesian fare. Cheung introduced concepts from the Chicago School: constrained maximization, transaction costs, property rights, and rigorous attention to methodology. A generation of Hong Kong students learned economics with a distinctive Cheungian flavor.</p>

<p>In 2016, Cheung claimed to have written "1,500 articles and 20 books in Chinese" during his career. Whether or not the number is precise, his influence on Chinese-speaking audiences far exceeded his impact in the English-speaking academic world.</p>

<h2>The Prediction Business</h2>

<p>Economists are notoriously bad at predictions. Cheung was unusually willing to make them anyway.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, when China's reforms were still tentative and many Western observers were skeptical they would last, Cheung predicted that China would transform into something much closer to a market economy. He analyzed the problems with state-owned enterprises—their inefficiency, their misaligned incentives—and argued they would eventually give way to private ownership. Through the turbulent decade that followed, including severe inflation and the Tiananmen Square crisis, Cheung stuck to his view that marketization would continue.</p>

<p>He was largely right. By the 1990s and 2000s, most of China's state-owned enterprises had been privatized, restructured, or marginalized. The Chinese economy had become overwhelmingly driven by private enterprise, even if the Communist Party retained political control.</p>

<p>Later, Cheung made a bolder prediction: that Shanghai would overtake Hong Kong as a financial center. At the time, this seemed almost absurd. Hong Kong had rule of law, free capital flows, a fully convertible currency, and decades of experience as Asia's premier financial hub. Shanghai had a stock market that was essentially a casino, capital controls, and all the uncertainties of operating under Communist Party rule.</p>

<p>By 2015, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had indeed surpassed Hong Kong's in terms of market capitalization. Whether this truly made Shanghai a more important financial center remained debatable—Hong Kong retained advantages in legal infrastructure, international accessibility, and professional services. But Cheung's prediction was at least partially vindicated.</p>

<h2>Learning Economics by Doing</h2>

<p>One of Cheung's most distinctive traits was his insistence on direct experience. He criticized most economists for being isolated from real economic life—analyzing markets they had never participated in, theorizing about businesses they had never run.</p>

<p>Cheung took a different approach. He ran a fish farm. He sold citrus fruit. He inspected the petroleum industry. He haggled over antiques. Each experience, he believed, taught him things about how markets actually work that no amount of reading could provide.</p>

<p>Consider haggling. In the standard economic model, there's a supply curve and a demand curve, and the price is where they cross. But anyone who has bought a rug in a bazaar knows that the actual price depends on a complex negotiation influenced by time pressure, information asymmetry, social dynamics, and pure theater. Cheung believed that understanding these textures of real transactions was essential to understanding economics.</p>

<h2>Stiglitz's Unlikely Inspiration</h2>

<p>Joseph Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001, largely for his work on the economics of information—showing how markets behave differently when buyers and sellers don't have the same information.</p>

<p>Stiglitz credited Cheung with inspiring this work—in a backhanded way.</p>

<p>Remember Cheung's theory of sharecropping? Cheung argued that under certain conditions, sharecropping would be just as efficient as other arrangements. Stiglitz thought Cheung's assumptions about information were unrealistic. In the real world, landlords don't know exactly how hard their tenants are working, and this changes everything.</p>

<p>Stiglitz called Cheung's sharecropping paper a "brilliant, valiant attempt" but argued that its "unreasonable assumptions, especially concerning information" actually demonstrated the importance of information problems in economics. By trying to prove too much, Cheung had inadvertently highlighted exactly where the standard model broke down.</p>

<p>This is how science often advances—not through everyone agreeing, but through rigorous disagreement that clarifies what matters.</p>

<h2>A Methodological Purist</h2>

<p>Cheung held strong views about what economics should and shouldn't do.</p>

<p>First, he believed that economic explanation—making sense of real-world phenomena—was the only legitimate purpose of economics. Prediction, policy recommendation, mathematical elegance—these were at best secondary, at worst distractions.</p>

<p>Second, he insisted that economic theories must be potentially refutable. Following the philosopher Karl Popper, he argued that if a theory couldn't possibly be proven wrong by any observation, it wasn't really a scientific theory. He criticized many mainstream economic concepts—like "utility"—as fundamentally unobservable and therefore unscientific. You can never directly measure how much utility someone gets from a cup of coffee; you can only observe that they bought it. Building elaborate theories on unobservable foundations struck Cheung as an intellectual con game.</p>

<p>Third, he believed in starting from observation rather than assumption. Many economists begin with a mathematical model and then look for evidence. Cheung preferred to observe puzzling real-world phenomena—like sharecropping, or bee contracts, or the structure of firms—and then ask what constraints and incentives could explain what he saw.</p>

<h2>Legal Troubles</h2>

<p>In 2003, Cheung's academic career came to an abrupt and controversial end.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury in the United States indicted him on thirteen counts: six charges of filing false income tax returns, six charges of filing false foreign bank account reports, and one charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. The government alleged he had failed to report income from Hong Kong parking lots and other businesses.</p>

<p>The United States is unusual among nations in taxing its citizens on worldwide income, regardless of where they live. An American citizen living in Hong Kong for decades must still report all income to the Internal Revenue Service. Many expatriates don't realize this, or assume that since they're paying local taxes abroad, they're covered.</p>

<p>Cheung claimed that he had relied on his tax consultant's advice and didn't know he was required to report the income in question. Experts noted that ignorance of this particular tax requirement is common among American expatriates, and the government typically doesn't pursue criminal charges for it—usually just asking for back taxes.</p>

<p>Why Cheung was singled out for federal prosecution remains unclear. Journalists speculated about ulterior motives, though no evidence of a political vendetta has been established.</p>

<p>The practical consequence was that Cheung, who had been a professor at the University of Hong Kong, could not return there without risking extradition to the United States. Hong Kong had an extradition treaty with America; mainland China did not. Cheung decamped to the mainland, where he has remained ever since, writing books and columns and occasionally visiting Chinese universities.</p>

<h2>The Antiques Affair</h2>

<p>Around the same time as his tax troubles, Cheung faced another controversy.</p>

<p>From 1998 to 2003, a company called Thesaurus Fine Arts operated in Seattle, dealing in Asian antiques. It was a subsidiary of Steven N. S. Cheung Inc. A series of investigative reports in the Seattle Times alleged that many of the antiques sold by Thesaurus were fakes.</p>

<p>In 2004, the Washington State Attorney General filed consumer fraud charges. The following year, Thesaurus settled for up to $550,000 in fines, fees, and restitution. Cheung himself was dropped from the case; while his company owned Thesaurus, he was apparently not an officer, director, or shareholder of the subsidiary.</p>

<p>Cheung denied ownership of Thesaurus and any involvement in its operations. The episode remains murky, but it added to the cloud over his final years in public life.</p>

<h2>An Economist's Legacy</h2>

<p>How should we assess Steven Cheung?</p>

<p>His academic contributions are real and lasting. The theory of share tenancy changed how economists think about contracts. "The Fable of the Bees" became a classic demonstration of how markets can solve externality problems that economists assumed required government intervention. His work on the firm influenced a generation of institutional economists.</p>

<p>His influence on Chinese economic thinking is harder to measure but probably substantial. For decades, he was one of the primary voices introducing market economics to Chinese-speaking audiences. Whether this actually influenced policy, or simply reflected ideas whose time had come anyway, is impossible to say.</p>

<p>His methodological commitments—observation over abstraction, refutability over elegance, real-world understanding over mathematical sophistication—represent a road not taken by mainstream economics. Whether that road would have led somewhere better is one of those questions that can't be answered.</p>

<p>And his personal story—fleeing Japanese invasion as a child, befriending Nobel laureates, predicting China's rise, ending up in legal exile on the mainland—captures something of the turbulent century through which he lived.</p>

<p>Cheung is now in his late eighties, still writing occasionally, still holding forth on economics and China and whatever else catches his interest. He remains, as he always was, convinced that most economists have gotten it wrong and that he has gotten it right. Given his track record, this confidence is not entirely unjustified.</p>
