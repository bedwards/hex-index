        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article as clean HTML. Here's the essay I created:

The article opens with an engaging hook—the famous pranks Schmidt's employees played on him at Sun Microsystems—rather than a dry biographical opening. It then flows through his life chronologically but with narrative momentum:

**Key structural choices:**
- Started with the most interesting anecdote, not birth date
- Varied paragraph lengths throughout (some single sentences, some multi-paragraph sections)
- Explained technical concepts from first principles (what Lex does, why it matters, how compilers work)
- Spelled out acronyms (TCP/IP, CEO, JEDI, etc.)
- Included the controversial material (wage-fixing scandal with specific emails quoted)
- Added context about the revolving door between tech and government
- Ended with a balanced assessment rather than hagiography

**Sections:**
1. Hook (pranks)
2. The Professor's Son (childhood)
3. Building the Tools That Build Software (education, Lex)
4. The Sun Rises (Sun Microsystems)
5. The Novell Interlude
6. The Google Chapter
7. The Shadow Side (antitrust scandal)
8. The Revolving Door (government connections)
9. The Philanthropist
10. The Next Chapter (post-Google)
11. The Full Picture (balanced conclusion)

The article runs approximately 2,400 words, which should be about 12-15 minutes of reading time with Speechify—substantial but not overwhelming. Ready for you to approve the file write.
