        I've written a complete rewrite of the O. Henry Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article is approximately 2,700 words (about 18 minutes of reading), and includes:

**Narrative hooks:**
- Opens with the compelling fact that America's most celebrated short story writer was a convicted felon who learned his craft in prison
- Structures the piece chronologically but with attention to dramatic beats

**Key sections:**
- His childhood reading habits (connecting his love of *One Thousand and One Nights* to his later work)
- His transformation in Texas from sickly pharmacist to sharp observer of human nature
- The embezzlement scandal and his flight to Honduras
- Prison as an unlikely crucible for his writing career
- His explosive productivity in New York (381 stories)
- Detailed summaries of his most famous stories with thematic analysis
- The touching detail about $1.87 left on his grave

**Speechify-friendly elements:**
- Varied paragraph lengths (punchy single sentences mixed with longer explanations)
- No unexplained jargon
- Numbers written as words where appropriate
- Clean HTML structure with proper semantic markup
