        I've written the rewritten Gene Sharp article. Here it is as clean HTML:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Sharp">Wikipedia: Gene Sharp</a></p>

<p>In 1991, as the Baltic states prepared to break free from the Soviet Union, Lithuanian Defence Minister Audrius Butkevičius made a remarkable declaration: "I would rather have this book than the nuclear bomb." He was referring to the writings of a quiet, unassuming professor from Massachusetts named Gene Sharp, a man who had spent his career cataloging the weapons of the powerless.</p>

<p>Sharp was not a revolutionary in any conventional sense. He never led a protest march or organized a strike. He spent most of his life in academic obscurity, running a shoestring nonprofit from his modest home near Boston's Logan Airport. Yet his ideas have been credited with helping topple dictators across the globe, from Serbia to Egypt, from Ukraine to the Baltic republics. His handbook on nonviolent resistance has been translated into over thirty languages and downloaded by dissidents on every continent.</p>

<p>His central insight was deceptively simple: all political power, no matter how brutal or entrenched, ultimately rests on the consent of the governed.</p>

<h2>The Unlikely Revolutionary</h2>

<p>Gene Sharp was born in 1928 in North Baltimore, Ohio, the son of an itinerant Protestant minister. This nomadic childhood, moving from congregation to congregation, gave him an early education in how communities function and how authority operates. He studied social sciences at Ohio State University, but his real education came from a decision that would land him in prison.</p>

<p>During the Korean War, Sharp refused to be drafted. This was not a casual act of protest but a deliberate choice to accept the consequences of his beliefs. He served nine months of a two-year sentence for resisting conscription. During his legal battles, he corresponded with Albert Einstein, who was so impressed by the young man's commitment that he wrote the foreword to Sharp's first book, a study of Mahatma Gandhi's methods.</p>

<p>After his release, Sharp worked odd jobs. Factory laborer. Guide to a blind social worker. Secretary to A.J. Muste, then considered America's leading pacifist. Each experience brought him closer to the practitioners of nonviolent action, the people who were actually trying to change the world without weapons.</p>

<p>From 1955 to 1958, he worked as assistant editor of Peace News in London, a weekly pacifist newspaper. There he helped organize the 1958 Aldermaston March, a demonstration against nuclear weapons that drew thousands of protesters on a fifty-mile walk from London to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. Then he spent two years in Oslo, studying with the philosopher Arne Næss and the peace researcher Johan Galtung, both of whom were deeply influenced by Gandhi's concept of satyagraha, a Sanskrit term meaning "truth-force" or "soul-force."</p>

<p>In 1968, Sharp completed his doctorate at Oxford. His dissertation would become the foundation of his life's work.</p>

<h2>The 198 Methods</h2>

<p>Sharp's magnum opus, The Politics of Nonviolent Action, published in 1973, runs to over eight hundred pages. At its heart is a catalog of 198 distinct methods of nonviolent resistance, a taxonomy of defiance that ranges from the theatrical to the mundane.</p>

<p>Some are familiar: protest marches, strikes, boycotts. Others are more creative. Method 19 is "wearing of symbols," like the paper clips Norwegians wore during Nazi occupation as a silent sign of solidarity. Method 38 is "singing," which the Singing Revolution in Estonia would later demonstrate could literally help bring down an empire. Method 130 is "withdrawal of bank deposits," a tactic that can cripple a regime's finances without a single shot fired.</p>

<p>There are methods of persuasion: petitions, slogans, skywriting. Methods of noncooperation: refusing to pay taxes, walking out of meetings, staying home from work. Methods of intervention: sit-ins, blockades, alternative markets. Sharp documented them all with the meticulousness of a botanist cataloging species.</p>

<p>But the list was never the point. It was merely evidence for a more radical argument.</p>

<h2>The Monolith Is an Illusion</h2>

<p>Sharp's key insight, the one that made his work so dangerous to dictators, was this: power is not monolithic. It does not radiate from some intrinsic quality of those who rule. It flows upward from those who obey.</p>

<p>Consider a tyrant. He sits in a palace, commands armies, controls the courts. His power seems absolute, carved from stone. But look closer. The soldiers who enforce his orders have to choose to pull their triggers. The judges who sentence his enemies have to choose to sign the papers. The bureaucrats who run his government have to choose to show up for work. The merchants who keep the economy running have to choose to open their shops.</p>

<p>Every act of obedience is a choice. And choices can be unmade.</p>

<p>Sharp traced this idea to a sixteenth-century French writer named Étienne de La Boétie, who at the age of eighteen wrote a treatise with a provocative title: Discourse on Voluntary Servitude. La Boétie had noticed something strange about tyranny. Even the most brutal despots had only a handful of close supporters. The vast machinery of oppression depended on millions of ordinary people who could, if they chose, simply stop cooperating.</p>

<blockquote>Resolve to serve no more, and you are at once freed. I do not ask that you place hands upon the tyrant to topple him over, but simply that you support him no longer; then you will behold him, like a great Colossus whose pedestal has been pulled away, fall of his own weight and break into pieces.</blockquote>

<p>Sharp took this observation and turned it into a science.</p>

<h2>The Pillars of Support</h2>

<p>In Sharp's analysis, every regime rests on what he called "pillars of support": the institutions and social groups that keep it functioning. These might include the military, the police, the civil service, religious authorities, business leaders, or simply the acquiescence of ordinary citizens going about their daily lives.</p>

<p>A frontal assault on a dictatorship, Sharp argued, plays to the regime's strengths. Armies are designed to defeat other armies. Secret police are trained to infiltrate conspiracies. Violence gives the state an excuse to use its overwhelming capacity for violence in return.</p>

<p>But what if you attacked the pillars instead? What if soldiers started questioning their orders, bureaucrats began losing paperwork, merchants closed their shops, and citizens simply stopped pretending to believe the official lies?</p>

<p>This is the essence of nonviolent struggle as Sharp conceived it. Not a moral stance, though it might be that too, but a practical strategy. You don't fight the regime's strengths. You undermine its foundations.</p>

<h2>From Theory to Revolution</h2>

<p>For decades, Sharp labored in relative obscurity. He founded the Albert Einstein Institution in 1983, a nonprofit dedicated to studying and promoting nonviolent action. At its peak, the organization had significant funding and a real office. Then, in 2004, the money dried up. Income dropped from over a million dollars a year to as little as a hundred and sixty thousand. Sharp moved the operation to his home, running it with a single assistant.</p>

<p>But his ideas had already escaped into the world.</p>

<p>In 1993, Sharp published a slim handbook called From Dictatorship to Democracy. Originally written to help the Burmese opposition, it provided a practical blueprint for dismantling authoritarian regimes. The book was just ninety pages, accessible to anyone, easily translated and smuggled across borders.</p>

<p>It spread like a virus.</p>

<p>In Serbia, the student movement Otpor used Sharp's methods to bring down Slobodan Milošević in 2000. Otpor, whose name means "resistance," became famous for its clenched fist symbol and its irreverent mockery of the regime. They had studied Sharp's work carefully, absorbing his lessons about identifying regime weaknesses, maintaining nonviolent discipline, and building broad coalitions.</p>

<p>From Serbia, the methods spread. Georgia's Kmara movement, whose name means "enough," used similar tactics to overthrow Eduard Shevardnadze in the 2003 Rose Revolution. Ukraine's PORA, meaning "it's time," adapted the playbook for the 2004 Orange Revolution. In each case, activists explicitly credited Sharp's influence.</p>

<h2>The Arab Spring and Its Discontents</h2>

<p>When the Arab Spring erupted in 2011, Sharp's name suddenly appeared in newspapers around the world. The New York Times reported that his handbook had been posted on the Muslim Brotherhood's website during the Egyptian revolution. The Associated Press noted that activists close to opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei had been using Sharp's work months before President Hosni Mubarak fell.</p>

<p>Not everyone was pleased by this narrative.</p>

<p>Egyptian blogger and activist Hossam el-Hamalawy pushed back hard against what he saw as Western appropriation of an Egyptian revolution. "The latter have been the major source of inspiration, not Gene Sharp," he wrote, referring to Palestinians as the real model for Egyptian resistance. "Whom the clueless NYT moronically gives credit for our uprising."</p>

<p>Another Egyptian writer, Karim Alrawi, made a more subtle critique. Sharp's work, he argued, was about regime change, not revolution. There was a difference. Regime change could replace one set of rulers with another. Revolution implied something deeper, a transformation in the ethical foundations of society. Sharp deliberately avoided engaging with these larger questions.</p>

<p>This criticism cut to something real about Sharp's approach. He was a technician of resistance, not a philosopher of liberation. His methods were explicitly neutral about ends. The same tactics that could bring down a dictator could, in theory, be used for less noble purposes.</p>

<p>Yet the evidence that Sharp's ideas mattered in Egypt was substantial. Dalia Ziada, an Egyptian blogger, confirmed that activists had translated excerpts into Arabic. Ahmed Maher, a leader of the April 6 movement, stated directly that "Gene Sharp's books had a huge impact." The techniques were there, whether or not Sharp deserved sole credit.</p>

<h2>The Accusations</h2>

<p>Sharp's influence made him a target. If his ideas were helping topple regimes, some of those regimes wanted to discredit him.</p>

<p>In 2005, the French writer Thierry Meyssan accused Sharp of having connections to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, the National Endowment for Democracy, and various other instruments of American power. The Iranian government, after protesters challenged the disputed 2009 elections, charged demonstrators with following Sharp's tactics, claiming that "over 100 stages of the 198 steps of Gene Sharp were implemented in the foiled velvet revolution."</p>

<p>Venezuelan critics accused him of "marketing regime change" to willing consumers in countries Washington wanted destabilized.</p>

<p>These accusations placed Sharp in an uncomfortable position. His funding had, at various points in his career, come from sources connected to the American government. His doctoral research at Oxford was partly funded by a project from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, the Pentagon's research arm. This was the same agency that would later fund the development of the internet.</p>

<p>Sharp denied any collaboration with intelligence agencies. In 2008, a group of prominent left-wing intellectuals including Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn signed a letter defending him. They stated unequivocally that the Albert Einstein Institution had "never received any money from any government or government-funded entity" and had never collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency or taken sides in political conflicts.</p>

<p>The letter emphasized the reality of Sharp's circumstances: a minimal budget, a staff of two, an operation run from his home. He was hardly in a position to orchestrate international intrigues.</p>

<h2>The Paradox of Nonviolent Power</h2>

<p>Sharp's work occupies a strange place in political theory. He is sometimes called the "Machiavelli of nonviolence" or the "Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare," references to the great theorists of power politics and military strategy. These nicknames capture something essential about his approach.</p>

<p>Machiavelli and Clausewitz were pragmatists. They wrote about power as it actually operates, not as moralists wish it would. Sharp shared this unsentimental quality. He was not primarily interested in the ethics of nonviolence, though he may have had ethical commitments. He was interested in what works.</p>

<p>This pragmatism made his ideas useful to a wide range of movements with very different goals. Serbian nationalists and Egyptian Islamists could both find something valuable in his catalog of methods. This universality was precisely what critics like Marcie Smith objected to when she called Sharp's theories "ideologically incoherent" and warned they could be "easily co-opted" by forces the original protesters opposed.</p>

<p>There is something to this critique. A revolution that replaces one set of elites with another has not necessarily achieved anything. A movement that forces concessions from a regime but lacks a positive vision for society may find its victories hollow.</p>

<p>But Sharp never claimed to offer a complete theory of political transformation. He offered a toolkit. What people built with those tools was their own responsibility.</p>

<h2>The Quiet End</h2>

<p>Gene Sharp died on January 28, 2018, just a week after his ninetieth birthday, at his home in Boston. He left behind a body of work that had influenced struggles on every continent, a legacy that his critics and admirers alike struggled to fully measure.</p>

<p>He had lived long enough to see his ideas tested in revolutions that succeeded and revolutions that failed, in color-coded uprisings that brought new leaders to power and springs that turned to winter. He had been credited with too much and blamed for things he never did. He had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize at least four times without winning it.</p>

<p>What he had actually accomplished was something more modest and more significant than any prize could recognize. He had systematized something that rebels and dissidents had always known intuitively: that the powerful need the cooperation of the powerless more than the powerless need the permission of the powerful.</p>

<p>He had written it down. He had organized it. He had made it teachable.</p>

<p>And in doing so, he had given anyone with the courage to act a manual for understanding their own strength. Whether they used that strength wisely was, as it always had been, up to them.</p>
