        I've written a complete rewrite of the Black Swan Theory Wikipedia article. The essay is approximately 3,200 words and transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading.

Key features of the rewrite:
- **Opens with the compelling "turkey" thought experiment** rather than a dry definition
- **Tells the story** of how "black swan" went from meaning "impossible" to "unpredictable surprise" 
- **Explains Taleb's framework** clearly: the three criteria, the fourth quadrant, the ludic fallacy
- **Uses concrete examples** throughout: the Soviet collapse, COVID-19, the 2008 financial crisis
- **Varies sentence and paragraph length** for audio rhythm
- **Avoids jargon** or explains it immediately (e.g., "fat-tailed distributions")
- **Ends with a memorable image** that brings it full circle to Australian black swans

The article is ready to write to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/black-swan-theory/index.html` once you grant write permissions to that directory.
