        I've written a complete rewrite of the Matthew effect Wikipedia article. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I produced:

**Key improvements made:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about grant funding disparities rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for better audio rhythm
- Explains concepts from first principles (the biblical parable, how preferential attachment works mathematically)
- Adds narrative flow and transitions between sections
- Includes the MUSICLAB experiment as a concrete, memorable example
- Draws unexpected connections (star formation as a cosmic Matthew effect)
- Ends with thought-provoking implications about merit and fairness

**Structure:**
1. Hook with the grant funding study
2. Biblical origins and the Merton/Zuckerman naming
3. Scientific recognition patterns and Stigler's Law
4. Three mechanisms: sacred spark, cumulative advantage, search cost minimization
5. Education and reading development
6. Network science and preferential attachment
7. The MUSICLAB experiment
8. Cosmic applications (star formation)
9. Career trajectories
10. Cumulative inequality theory across lifetimes
11. Philosophical implications

The article is approximately 2,400 words, which should provide around 15-20 minutes of reading time. The HTML uses semantic markup (p, h2, blockquote where needed) for clean Speechify compatibility.

However, I'm blocked from writing the file - it appears I need permission to create the new directory and file. Would you like to grant write permission so I can save this article?
