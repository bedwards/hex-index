        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article on Evolutionary Ecology. The article transforms the encyclopedic source material into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here are the key features:

**Opening Hook**: Rather than starting with a dry definition, it opens with intriguing questions about bird eggs, species cooperation, and African cichlid fish diversity.

**Structure**: The essay flows through major concepts:
- The Lack clutch size model and Darwin's finches
- Gause's competitive exclusion principle
- Levins' fine-grained vs coarse-grained environments
- Mutualism and adaptive dynamics
- The tangled nature model
- Ecological genetics (with the peppered moth example)
- Key figures: Darwin, Hutchinson, MacArthur, Pianka, Rosenzweig
- Symbiosis in aphids
- Cichlid fish speciation

**Audio-Optimized Writing**:
- Varied paragraph lengths (short punchy ones mixed with explanatory ones)
- Technical terms explained immediately in plain language
- No acronyms left unexpanded
- Narrative flow with transitions between sections

**Added Context**: I drew on broader biological knowledge to add engaging examples like the fig wasp-fig tree mutualism and the peppered moth industrial melanism story, which weren't in the original but illustrate the concepts vividly.

The file is ready to write to `docs/wikipedia/evolutionary-ecology/index.html` once permission is granted.
