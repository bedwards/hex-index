        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the WeChat Wikipedia article, transforming it from an encyclopedic reference into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article is about 18 minutes of reading material and follows the same HTML template structure used by other Wikipedia articles in your library.

The rewrite:
- Opens with a compelling hook about the 2014 "Pearl Harbor moment" when WeChat's red envelope feature disrupted Alibaba's payments dominance
- Explains WeChat as a "super-app" using relatable Western comparisons
- Covers the origin story, voice messaging breakthrough, and the critical distinction between Weixin (Chinese) and WeChat (international) versions
- Explains features like Moments, WeChat Pay, Mini Programs, and Channels in accessible language
- Addresses the surveillance and censorship implications honestly
- Discusses the global backlash including bans in India and the attempted US ban
- Concludes with broader lessons about timing, friction elimination, and the privacy trade-offs
