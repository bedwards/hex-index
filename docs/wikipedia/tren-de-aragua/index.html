        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Wikipedia article about Tren de Aragua. The article is ready but I need permission to write to the file `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/tren-de-aragua/index.html`.

The essay:
- Opens with a compelling hook about a prison serving as gang headquarters
- Explains the organization's origins in Venezuelan prisons
- Provides context on the Venezuelan refugee crisis
- Distinguishes Tren de Aragua from MS-13 and compares it to Colombian cartels
- Details the DOJ's point system for identifying members
- Covers the terrorist designation and its legal implications
- Addresses the Aurora incident and misinformation around it
- Describes operations in Chile, Peru, and South America
- Explains the deportation flights and legal challenges
- Concludes with nuanced analysis of what's known vs. contested

The piece is approximately 3,500 words and optimized for text-to-speech reading with varied sentence and paragraph lengths.
