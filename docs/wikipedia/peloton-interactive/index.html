<p>In December 2021, a fictional character killed a real company's stock price.</p>

<p>Mr. Big, the charismatic love interest from <em>Sex and the City</em>, climbed onto a Peloton bike in the reboot series <em>And Just Like That...</em>, pedaled through an intense workout, stepped off, and promptly died of a heart attack. The next day, Peloton's shares dropped 11.3 percent. A scripted death in a television show had erased hundreds of millions of dollars in market value.</p>

<p>The company scrambled to respond. They enlisted a cardiologist from their health advisory board to issue a statement pointing out that the character had a history of heart problems, smoked cigars, and ate steaks with abandon. They rushed out a commercial featuring Ryan Reynolds, who quipped about the benefits of cycling and reassured viewers, "He's alive." Then that ad had to be pulled too, after the actor who played Mr. Big faced sexual assault allegations.</p>

<p>It was, in miniature, the story of Peloton itself: a company that seemed to embody the future of fitness, only to find itself pedaling furiously against forces beyond its control.</p>

<h2>The Birth of a $50 Billion Idea</h2>

<p>The name "Peloton" comes from cycling, where it refers to the main pack of riders in a race—dozens of cyclists drafting off each other, moving as a single organism. It's an apt metaphor for what John Foley envisioned in 2011.</p>

<p>Foley was an executive at Barnes & Noble, watching the book industry transform around him. He had a simple observation: people loved boutique fitness classes, the kind offered at studios like SoulCycle where charismatic instructors led high-energy cycling sessions. But these classes were expensive, hard to schedule, and only available in major cities. What if technology could beam that experience into anyone's home?</p>

<p>He pitched the idea to his colleague Tom Cortese, and in January 2012, they founded Peloton Interactive. The concept was straightforward—a stationary bicycle with an internet-connected touchscreen that would stream live and recorded classes from professional instructors. Riders could see their performance metrics in real time and compete on leaderboards with other users pedaling along at the same moment.</p>

<p>The early funding was modest: $400,000 in seed money in February 2012, then another $3.5 million by the end of the year. In 2013, they sold their first bike on Kickstarter for an early-bird price of $1,500. By 2014, the connected bicycle with its tablet screen was shipping to customers.</p>

<p>The business model had two revenue streams. First, the hardware: expensive exercise equipment that customers purchased outright. Second, the subscription: a monthly fee for access to the classes that made the equipment worthwhile. It was the razor-and-blade model, except the razor cost as much as a used car.</p>

<h2>What Made It Different</h2>

<p>To understand Peloton's appeal, you need to understand what it was competing against.</p>

<p>Traditional home exercise equipment—treadmills, stationary bikes, weight machines—shared a common fate. People bought them with the best intentions, used them enthusiastically for a few weeks, and then gradually abandoned them. The equipment became expensive clothes hangers, gathering dust in basements and spare bedrooms. The fitness industry had a term for this: the "January Effect," referring to the surge of gym memberships and equipment purchases in the new year, followed by the predictable dropoff by March.</p>

<p>Boutique fitness classes solved the motivation problem. When you paid $35 for a single SoulCycle session, you showed up. When an instructor called your name and an energetic community surrounded you, you pushed harder. But these classes required you to live near a studio, fit your schedule around class times, and pay premium prices for every session.</p>

<p>Peloton's innovation was combining the convenience of home equipment with the engagement of boutique fitness. The live classes created urgency—a specific time to show up. The leaderboards created competition—other riders to chase or stay ahead of. The instructors became celebrities, developing devoted followings. Users talked about their favorite instructors the way sports fans talked about their favorite players.</p>

<p>The equipment itself had sophisticated sensors tracking power output, cadence, and resistance, letting riders measure their performance with precision. This data fed the competitive element, allowing users to compare their efforts against their own past performances and against other riders.</p>

<h2>The Pandemic Windfall</h2>

<p>When COVID-19 forced gyms to close in early 2020, Peloton found itself perfectly positioned for a world that suddenly had to exercise at home.</p>

<p>Demand exploded. The company's stock price quadrupled. People who had been skeptical of paying $2,000 for a stationary bike suddenly found it was the only option. Waiting lists stretched for months as manufacturing and shipping struggled to keep pace.</p>

<p>The surge was so intense that it created problems. Customers who ordered bikes in the fall received them months late. Some canceled their orders in frustration. In December 2020, Peloton invested $100 million in shipping solutions, trying to accelerate delivery times. The company was simultaneously experiencing unprecedented success and failing to meet customer expectations.</p>

<p>At its peak in January 2021, Peloton reached a market valuation of $50 billion. For context, that's roughly what Ford Motor Company was worth at the time. A company selling exercise bikes had achieved the same market capitalization as one of America's largest automakers.</p>

<p>Success bred competition. More than a dozen rivals rushed to create their own connected fitness equipment. Equinox, the luxury gym chain, developed competing products. Icon Health & Fitness entered the market. Flywheel Sports, which had created its own internet-connected bike, was sued by Peloton for patent infringement. Internal documents revealed that Flywheel had created a deliberate initiative to obtain Peloton's trade secrets. They settled, shut down their home cycling service, and Peloton offered to swap Flywheel bikes for refurbished Pelotons at no cost to affected users.</p>

<h2>The Fall</h2>

<p>The pandemic that made Peloton also contained the seeds of its reversal.</p>

<p>As vaccines rolled out and gyms reopened, the extraordinary demand evaporated. People who had been trapped at home were eager to return to in-person fitness classes. The customers who wanted a Peloton had already bought one. New customer acquisition slowed dramatically.</p>

<p>By January 2022, internal documents leaked to CNBC revealed that Peloton had paused production of its bikes and treadmills. The company denied the report, but the underlying reality was clear: they had built capacity for pandemic-level demand that no longer existed.</p>

<p>The numbers told the story. After quadrupling in 2020, the stock dropped nearly 80 percent in 2021. By April 2022, the company that had been valued at $50 billion was worth about $8 billion—a decline of 84 percent from its peak. As of early 2025, the market capitalization has fallen further, to approximately $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>The decline triggered a cascade of changes. In February 2022, Peloton laid off 2,800 employees to save $800 million annually. John Foley stepped down as CEO, taking the ceremonial role of executive chairman. His replacement was Barry McCarthy, who had served as chief financial officer at both Spotify and Netflix—companies that understood subscription businesses and the challenge of maintaining growth after rapid expansion.</p>

<p>The leadership changes continued. By September 2022, Foley left entirely, along with the chief legal officer and chief commercial officer. In May 2024, McCarthy himself resigned, announcing another 15 percent workforce reduction and a pullback in retail operations. By June 2024, the company's market value had dropped to about $1.3 billion—less than the $8.1 billion valuation at its 2019 initial public offering.</p>

<h2>Safety Crises</h2>

<p>Compounding the business challenges were serious safety incidents.</p>

<p>In May 2021, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission—the federal agency responsible for protecting the public from dangerous products—issued an urgent warning about Peloton's Tread+ treadmill. One child had died after being pulled under the machine while a parent was running on it. Nearly forty others had suffered injuries, including fractured bones. The commission recommended that owners immediately stop using the product and store it in a locked room away from children and pets.</p>

<p>Peloton's initial response was defensive. They rejected the recall request and instead advised parents to keep children away from the treadmill. This position lasted only days before public pressure forced a reversal. On May 5, 2021, the company voluntarily recalled both the Tread+ and the standard Tread model. The latter recall was due to a separate issue—touchscreen displays occasionally fell off due to loose screws.</p>

<p>A Brooklyn couple later sued after their three-year-old son suffered third-degree burns from being trapped under a treadmill. The company implemented new safety features, including a digital passcode lock and a physical safety key that must be in place before the treadmill will operate.</p>

<p>The troubles weren't limited to treadmills. In May 2023, Peloton recalled 2.2 million of its original stationary bicycles after reports of seat posts breaking during use. Thirty-five incidents had been reported, including thirteen injuries—one fractured wrist, plus various lacerations and bruises. Owners were told to immediately stop using their bikes until repairs could be made.</p>

<h2>The Legal Battles</h2>

<p>The music that powers a spin class isn't incidental—it's essential. The pulsing beats, the motivational lyrics, the instructor timing their encouragement to the song's crescendo. Peloton's classes relied heavily on popular music to create their energetic atmosphere.</p>

<p>In March 2019, the National Music Publishers Association sued Peloton for using copyrighted songs without proper licenses. Synchronization licenses—the legal permissions needed to match music with video content—are distinct from the licenses that allow songs to be played on the radio or streamed on Spotify. Peloton, the suit alleged, had been using music without these required licenses.</p>

<p>The initial suit sought $150 million in damages. By September, it had been amended to $300 million. The company was forced to remove certain classes from its library and change the music in others. In February 2020, they settled for undisclosed terms.</p>

<p>The lawsuit highlighted a genuine complexity in Peloton's business model. They weren't just selling exercise equipment—they were producing thousands of hours of video content, each requiring music licenses. As a content company, they faced content company problems.</p>

<h2>The Product Lineup</h2>

<p>Understanding Peloton requires understanding what they actually sell.</p>

<p>The original Peloton Bike features a 21.5-inch touchscreen running a customized version of Android, the operating system that powers most non-Apple smartphones. Riders can stream classes live or on-demand, competing on leaderboards with other users. The bike includes clip-in pedals compatible with cycling shoes, though customers can purchase flat pedals if they prefer regular sneakers.</p>

<p>In September 2020, the company introduced the Bike+, featuring a larger 23.8-inch screen that can rotate to face different directions—useful for off-bike exercises that instructors incorporate into some workouts. The Bike+ also includes auto-resistance, meaning the bike can automatically adjust its difficulty based on instructor cues, rather than requiring the rider to manually turn a dial.</p>

<p>The treadmill line has had a more troubled history. The original Tread, unveiled in 2018, featured a 32-inch touchscreen and a slatted rubber running surface similar to professional Woodway treadmills. When Peloton introduced a lower-priced treadmill in 2020, they renamed the original as the Tread+ to indicate its premium status. Both models were recalled in 2021 and subsequently updated with enhanced safety features.</p>

<p>Peloton expanded into rowing in 2022, introducing the Peloton Row at a price of $3,195. The company also released the Peloton Guide in April 2022—a $295 camera device that connects to any television and uses computer vision to track users' movements during strength training workouts.</p>

<p>For users without Peloton equipment, the company offers a digital membership at $12.99 per month (with discounts for students, healthcare workers, first responders, and teachers). This provides access to all classes through apps on various platforms including Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Android TV. The equipment subscription—required to access full features on Peloton hardware—costs $44 per month as of 2022, up from the previous price of $39.</p>

<h2>The Business Model Evolution</h2>

<p>Peloton's pricing strategy has evolved dramatically under pressure.</p>

<p>Initially, the company followed the classic hardware-plus-subscription model: sell expensive equipment at healthy margins, then collect recurring subscription revenue. But as growth stalled, they began experimenting.</p>

<p>In March 2022, Peloton tested a rental program called "One Peloton Club." Instead of purchasing a bike outright, customers pay a monthly fee that includes both the equipment rental and the subscription to classes. This shifts the financial model from large upfront purchases to pure recurring revenue—potentially lowering the barrier to entry for price-sensitive customers.</p>

<p>That April, the company announced price cuts on equipment while simultaneously raising subscription prices. The base bike dropped from $1,745 to $1,445. The thinking was straightforward: make the hardware more accessible, then make money on the ongoing subscriptions. It's the same logic that leads video game console makers to sell hardware near cost while profiting on game sales.</p>

<p>In August 2022, Peloton took another significant step by beginning to sell its products through Amazon. This represented a departure from their previous direct-to-consumer approach, which had emphasized showrooms where customers could try equipment before purchasing. The Amazon partnership came after discussions about a potential acquisition of Peloton by Amazon or another major company.</p>

<p>The company also began outsourcing manufacturing in July 2022, ending its in-house production of bikes and treadmills. Combined with ongoing layoffs, these moves represented a fundamental shift from growth-at-all-costs to desperate cost-cutting.</p>

<h2>The Competitive Landscape</h2>

<p>Peloton's hardware remains a market leader in connected fitness equipment, but its digital subscription faces intense competition.</p>

<p>For cyclists who already own a stationary bike—or who prefer riding a traditional bicycle mounted on an indoor trainer—numerous alternatives exist at similar price points. Apps like Zwift, TrainerRoad, and Apple Fitness+ offer guided cycling workouts without requiring Peloton's proprietary hardware.</p>

<p>Beyond cycling, Peloton competes for attention with a vast ecosystem of fitness content. YouTube offers countless free workout videos. Subscription services from Nike, Apple, and traditional gym chains provide guided exercises. The barrier to entry for fitness content is low, making sustained competitive advantage difficult.</p>

<p>Peloton's moat—the competitive advantage that protects its business—relies heavily on the quality of its instructors and the engagement of its community. The instructors have become genuine celebrities within the fitness world, with devoted followers who choose classes based on who's teaching rather than what's being taught. When star instructors left the company in 2024, it contributed to investor concerns about the sustainability of the business.</p>

<h2>The Class Experience</h2>

<p>Peloton offers far more than cycling classes, though that remains its core product.</p>

<p>The content library includes running and walking classes (for treadmill owners or outdoor exercisers tracking through the app), strength training, yoga, Pilates, meditation, stretching, and various bootcamp formats that combine cardio and strength work. New content is added constantly, with live classes scheduled throughout the day and thousands of on-demand sessions available in the archive.</p>

<p>The live element matters more than you might expect. Knowing that thousands of other people are taking the same class at the same moment creates a sense of event, of shared experience. Instructors call out milestone achievements—someone completing their 100th ride, someone exercising from a distant location. The leaderboard shows your position among current riders, creating real-time competition.</p>

<p>Until June 2022, users could even video chat with friends during classes, seeing each other on screen while exercising. This feature was discontinued, but it illustrated Peloton's broader ambition: not just fitness equipment, but a social platform built around exercise.</p>

<h2>The Cultural Moment</h2>

<p>Peloton became something more than a fitness company—it became a cultural symbol.</p>

<p>The 2019 holiday commercial that drew widespread mockery perfectly captured this symbolic status. In the ad, a woman receives a Peloton bike from her husband and documents her year of transformation through video diaries. Critics saw it as a husband gifting his already-thin wife exercise equipment with the implication that she needed to lose weight. The woman's slightly nervous expression as she thanked her husband spawned countless parodies and think pieces.</p>

<p>Peloton defended the ad as celebrating a "fitness and wellness journey," but the cultural conversation had already moved on. The actress, Monica Ruiz, was quickly hired for a parody commercial by Aviation American Gin (owned by Ryan Reynolds) titled "The Gift That Doesn't Give Back," showing her character drowning her sorrows at a bar.</p>

<p>The Mr. Big death scene two years later showed that Peloton had become a shorthand, a cultural reference that writers could use to communicate something about characters and their lifestyles. When a subsequent episode of <em>Billions</em> also featured a heart attack following Peloton use, it felt almost inevitable—the bike had become an icon of a certain type of striving, anxious affluence.</p>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>In January 2025, Peter Stern took over as CEO. Stern had previously served as Vice President of Services at Apple, overseeing subscription businesses including Apple TV+ and Apple Fitness+. His appointment signaled a continued focus on the subscription revenue that provides Peloton's most reliable income.</p>

<p>The challenges facing the company are substantial. The pandemic boom is long over, and the customers who wanted connected fitness equipment during lockdowns have already bought it. Competition for fitness content is intense and growing. The premium pricing that once positioned Peloton as an aspirational brand now makes customer acquisition difficult in a price-sensitive market.</p>

<p>In August 2024, the company introduced a $95 "used equipment fee" for second-hand buyers—an attempt to capture revenue from the thriving resale market where Peloton bikes change hands without the company seeing a cent. It's a sign of how far the company has traveled from the growth-at-all-costs mentality of its peak: now they're trying to extract value from equipment they've already sold once.</p>

<p>The subscription business remains the company's strongest asset. Monthly recurring revenue from existing subscribers provides stability that hardware sales cannot. The question is whether Peloton can retain those subscribers as competition intensifies and the novelty of connected fitness fades.</p>

<p>Peloton's story is, in many ways, the story of pandemic-era business in microcosm. Extraordinary circumstances created extraordinary demand. Companies scaled rapidly to meet that demand. And when circumstances normalized, they found themselves overbuilt for a world that no longer existed. The peloton—that tight pack of riders moving as one—has scattered. Now Peloton the company rides alone, trying to find a sustainable pace for the long road ahead.</p>
