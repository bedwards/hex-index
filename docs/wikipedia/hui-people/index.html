<p>In the global imagination, when people think of Muslims in China, they usually picture the Uyghurs—the Turkic-speaking population of Xinjiang whose plight has drawn international attention. But there is another Muslim community in China that vastly outnumbers them, speaks Mandarin as a native language, looks indistinguishable from the Han Chinese majority, and has been living in the country for over a thousand years. They are the Hui people, and their story complicates almost everything we think we know about religion, ethnicity, and identity in China.</p>

<p>There are roughly eleven million Hui in China today. That makes them one of the largest Muslim populations in any East Asian country. Yet most people outside China have never heard of them.</p>

<h2>The Paradox of a Chinese Muslim Identity</h2>

<p>The Hui present a genuine puzzle for how we typically think about ethnic groups. They have no distinctive language of their own—they speak Chinese, the same Chinese spoken by a billion other people. They have no homeland territory that was historically "theirs" in the way Xinjiang is associated with the Uyghurs or Tibet with Tibetans. They are scattered across the entire country, from the northwestern provinces near the old Silk Road to the central plains where Chinese civilization first took root.</p>

<p>What makes them Hui, then? The answer, paradoxically, is Islam—yet the Chinese government officially defines them as an ethnic group regardless of religious practice. You can be an atheist Hui. You can be a Buddhist Hui, at least in theory. The category captures anyone who descends from the historically Muslim communities that weren't absorbed into other officially recognized ethnic groups.</p>

<p>This creates some fascinating contradictions. The Hui are the only one of China's fifty-five officially recognized ethnic minorities that has no associated non-Chinese language. A Han Chinese person and a Hui person might be genetically indistinguishable, might speak identically, might have grown up in the same neighborhood—but one is Han and one is Hui, based entirely on ancestry that traces back to Islamic lineages.</p>

<h2>A Thousand Years of Silk Road Migration</h2>

<p>The origins of the Hui stretch back to the great age of overland trade between China and the West. When camel caravans crossed the vast deserts and mountain passes connecting Tang dynasty China to Persia, Central Asia, and the Arab world, they carried more than silk and spices. They carried people.</p>

<p>Traders from across the Islamic world settled in Chinese cities during the Tang dynasty, which ruled from 618 to 907. The Tang court was famously cosmopolitan, welcoming foreigners and their religions with a tolerance that would not be matched again for centuries. Arab and Persian merchants established communities in major commercial centers. Some married local women and stayed permanently.</p>

<p>The Song dynasty, which followed, continued this openness to foreign trade. But it was the Mongol Yuan dynasty, established by Kublai Khan in 1271, that really accelerated Muslim settlement in China. The Mongols, who had conquered a vast swath of territory from Korea to Poland, actively recruited Central Asian administrators and soldiers. They trusted these outsiders more than they trusted the conquered Chinese population. Muslim officials, craftsmen, and soldiers flooded into China under Mongol patronage.</p>

<p>Over the following centuries, these immigrant communities gradually assimilated. They intermarried with Han Chinese, adopted Chinese language and much of Chinese culture, but retained their Islamic faith and distinctive dietary practices. By the Ming dynasty, which expelled the Mongols and ruled from 1368 to 1644, these communities had become fully Chinese-speaking while remaining recognizably Muslim.</p>

<h2>What's in a Name?</h2>

<p>The term "Hui" has a tangled history. It appears to derive from "Huihe" or "Huihu," which was the Chinese name for the Uyghur empire that flourished in the eighth and ninth centuries. But here's the confusing part: those ancient Uyghurs weren't Muslim. They practiced Manichaeism and later Buddhism. The name seems to have drifted from meaning "those Central Asian people" to meaning "foreigners in general" to, eventually, "Muslims and other non-Chinese religious minorities."</p>

<p>During the Ming and Qing dynasties, "Huihui" was a catch-all term that included Muslims, Persian Christians, and even Jews. Chinese officials distinguished between groups by hat color: Arab Muslims were "White Cap Huihui," Persians were "Black Cap Huihui," and Jews were "Blue Cap Huihui." Islamic mosques and Jewish synagogues were both called by the same Chinese term: "Qingzhensi," meaning "Temple of Purity and Truth."</p>

<p>A revealing incident from Mongol times shows how Chinese rulers understood the commonality between these groups. Kublai Khan, annoyed that both Muslims and Jews refused to eat meat slaughtered in the Mongol fashion, issued an edict forbidding halal and kosher slaughter practices:</p>

<blockquote>"Among all the alien peoples only the Hui-hui say 'we do not eat Mongol food.' By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?"</blockquote>

<p>He banned the communities from slaughtering their own animals and even attempted to prohibit circumcision. The decree, like many imperial attempts to force religious conformity, was probably more aspiration than reality—the practices survived.</p>

<h2>The Genetics Tell a Story</h2>

<p>Modern genetic studies have shed light on the Hui's origins in ways that historical records alone cannot. The results reveal a population that is overwhelmingly East Asian in ancestry, with small but detectable traces of West Eurasian heritage—exactly what you would expect from centuries of intermarriage between immigrant men and local women.</p>

<p>On average, about ninety-three percent of Hui maternal lineages trace back to East Asian populations. Only about seven percent show West Eurasian ancestry. This makes sense: the original Silk Road migrants were predominantly male traders and soldiers. They married local women, and their descendants continued to marry locally across generations.</p>

<p>The paternal lineages show more variety. Some Hui communities in Guizhou province, for instance, show significant Central or North Asian paternal heritage, suggesting their ancestors arrived via a northern migration route before extensively intermarrying with local populations.</p>

<p>But the most striking finding is how similar the Hui are to their Han Chinese neighbors. In studies comparing populations in Linxia—a heavily Hui area in Gansu province sometimes called "China's Little Mecca"—the genetic overlap between Hui and Han is extensive. They cluster together in analyses, clearly distinct from Middle Eastern or European populations. Whatever their distant origins, the Hui are genetically a Chinese population.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the Hui actually show less West Eurasian admixture than the Uyghurs, who have about thirty-six percent Western ancestry. This reflects different histories: the Uyghurs have lived continuously in Central Asia where populations mixed more evenly, while the Hui represent a population that migrated into the Chinese heartland and was progressively absorbed into the local gene pool.</p>

<h2>Not Quite One Community</h2>

<p>Officially, the Hui are a single ethnic group. In practice, the category lumps together some remarkably different communities.</p>

<p>Most Hui are indeed Chinese-speaking Muslims whose ancestors trace back to Silk Road migration. But Chinese census categories also include some groups that complicate this picture.</p>

<p>On the southern tip of Hainan Island, there are several thousand people called the Utsuls. They speak Tsat, an Austronesian language related to the languages of Vietnam and the Philippines—not Chinese at all. According to anthropologists, they descend from Cham people who migrated from what is now Vietnam. The medieval kingdom of Champa was Hindu-Buddhist for most of its history but converted largely to Islam, and some Cham Muslims apparently sailed across the South China Sea to settle in Hainan. Yet because they're Muslim and don't fit any other ethnic category, China counts them as Hui.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are Muslim minorities among the Bai people of Yunnan province who speak Bai (a Tibeto-Burman language unrelated to Chinese) but are classified as Hui because of their religion. Some Tibetan Muslims face the same categorical ambiguity.</p>

<p>Then there are the Dungan people of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan—about 170,000 people who speak a dialect of Chinese written in Cyrillic script. They descend from Hui who fled China during the brutal nineteenth-century conflicts between Muslim communities and the Qing dynasty. They've lived in Central Asia for over a century now, but their language and many of their customs remain recognizably Chinese.</p>

<h2>Living Islam the Chinese Way</h2>

<p>The most visible marker of Hui identity is food. China is a country where pork is the default meat. It appears in everything from dumplings to stir-fries to the ubiquitous red braised pork belly. For the Hui, who follow Islamic dietary laws prohibiting pork, this creates a daily negotiation with mainstream Chinese culture.</p>

<p>The result has been the development of a distinctive Hui cuisine that is simultaneously authentically Chinese and strictly halal. Hui restaurants across China serve noodles, dumplings, and stir-fried dishes that would be familiar to any Chinese diner—but made with beef, lamb, or chicken instead of pork. The lamb kebabs that are now a fixture of Chinese street food culture owe their popularity largely to Hui vendors.</p>

<p>Hui neighborhoods often have their own butchers, restaurants, and food markets where everything is certified halal. Some dishes have become so associated with the Hui that they've spread into mainstream Chinese cuisine. Lanzhou beef noodles, perhaps the most famous noodle dish in China, originated with Hui cooks in Gansu province.</p>

<p>Traditional dress among observant Hui men often includes the white skullcap known as a taqiyah, similar to what Muslims wear across the Islamic world. Some Hui women wear headscarves. But many Hui, especially in urban areas and among younger generations, dress indistinguishably from other Chinese people.</p>

<h2>The Question of Recognition</h2>

<p>Before 1949, the status of the Hui was ambiguous. The Republic of China government—which ruled the mainland before retreating to Taiwan—didn't recognize the Hui as a separate ethnic group at all. Instead, it classified them as a branch of the Han Chinese who happened to practice Islam. In official documents, they were referred to as "Nationals in China proper with special convention," a bureaucratic circumlocution that avoided granting them distinct ethnic status.</p>

<p>Bai Chongxi, a prominent Hui general who served as Minister of National Defense and helped found the Chinese Muslim Association, referred to his own community as "Muslim Han people." This framing emphasized religious practice rather than ethnic difference—you could be Han and Muslim at the same time, just as you could be Han and Buddhist or Han and Christian.</p>

<p>The People's Republic of China took a different approach. In 1954, as part of a broader project to classify China's population into defined ethnic categories, the government officially recognized the Hui as one of China's ethnic minorities. This was a consequential choice. It meant the Hui would have guaranteed representation in government bodies, access to affirmative action in education and employment, and exemptions from certain policies—notably the one-child policy that constrained Han families for decades.</p>

<p>But it also locked the Hui into a particular kind of identity. Once you're classified as a minority nationality in China, that designation passes to your children regardless of their beliefs or practices. You can be an atheist Hui, but you're still officially Hui.</p>

<h2>Missionaries and Muslims</h2>

<p>The relationship between Christianity and the Hui in China has been complicated from the beginning. When Jesuit missionaries reached Beijing in the late sixteenth century, they were surprised to find that the term "Huihui" was applied not just to Muslims but to anyone following a foreign religion—potentially including themselves.</p>

<p>Matteo Ricci, the brilliant Italian Jesuit who became the first European to enter the Forbidden City, noted that Muslims—whom he called "Saracens"—were "everywhere in evidence" with "thousands of families scattered about in nearly every province." He also observed that Chinese people used the term Hui broadly. When a group of Chinese Jews from Kaifeng sought out Ricci, having heard there were fellow monotheists in Beijing, they initially assumed the Jesuits were fellow Jews.</p>

<p>This terminological confusion points to something important about how Chinese society categorized religious difference. From a Confucian perspective, what mattered was whether you followed Chinese ritual propriety or foreign customs. The specific content of foreign belief—whether you believed in the God of Abraham or Allah or the Christian Trinity—was less important than the fact that you were, fundamentally, not following the Chinese way.</p>

<h2>An Enduring Presence</h2>

<p>The Hui have survived—indeed thrived—through some of the most turbulent centuries in Chinese history. They weathered the transition from Mongol to Ming to Qing rule. They endured devastating nineteenth-century rebellions and equally devastating suppressions. They navigated the collapse of the imperial system, Japanese invasion, civil war, and Communist revolution.</p>

<p>Today, they represent a living argument against the idea that Islam and Chinese civilization are somehow incompatible. For over a thousand years, communities of Chinese Muslims have maintained their faith while participating fully in Chinese society. They speak Chinese, practice Chinese arts, follow Chinese customs in countless ways—and pray facing Mecca.</p>

<p>In a world that often sees clashes of civilizations everywhere, the Hui offer a different story. They are not torn between two identities. They are simply both: Chinese and Muslim, with a millennium of history to prove that the combination works.</p>
