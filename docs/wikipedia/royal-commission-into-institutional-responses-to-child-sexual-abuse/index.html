<h2>A Note That Said "Too Much Pain"</h2>

<p>In July 2012, John Pirona took his own life. He left behind a note with just four words: "Too Much Pain." Pirona had been sexually abused as a child by a Catholic priest named John Denham. His death, and the funeral that followed, would set in motion something unprecedented in Australian history.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard happened to be visiting Newcastle on the day of Pirona's funeral. Mourners there were rallying behind a local newspaper campaign called "Shine the Light"—a push for the government to finally investigate what everyone suspected but few had been willing to confront head-on: that institutions across Australia had been systematically covering up the sexual abuse of children for decades.</p>

<p>Within months, Gillard would announce the creation of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. It would become one of the largest and most significant public inquiries in Australian history.</p>

<h2>What Is a Royal Commission?</h2>

<p>Before we go further, it's worth understanding what a royal commission actually is—because it's not just another government committee or inquiry panel.</p>

<p>A royal commission is the most powerful form of public inquiry available in Australia and other Commonwealth countries. The name comes from the fact that these commissions derive their authority from the Crown—the formal term for the government's sovereign power. Think of it as the nuclear option for investigating matters of grave public concern.</p>

<p>Royal commissions have extraordinary legal powers. They can compel anyone to appear and give testimony. They can demand documents. They can authorize police to execute search warrants. Refusing to comply isn't just frowned upon—it's a criminal offense that can land you in prison.</p>

<p>These powers exist because royal commissions are reserved for situations where normal investigative mechanisms have failed or are insufficient. They're used when something has gone so wrong, across so many institutions, that only the full weight of government authority can hope to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>The child abuse royal commission would need every one of those powers.</p>

<h2>Decades of Allegations, Decades of Silence</h2>

<p>The abuse didn't start in the 2000s. It didn't start in the 1990s. Some of the allegations the commission would eventually investigate dated back to the 1950s—crimes committed when the Beatles hadn't yet formed and Australia still had the White Australia policy.</p>

<p>Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, allegations of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and other institutions began surfacing with increasing frequency. Some led to convictions. Others led to trials that dragged on for years. Many led nowhere at all.</p>

<p>What made these cases different from ordinary criminal matters was the pattern that emerged: abusers weren't being reported to police. Instead, they were being quietly moved from one parish to another, one school to another, one youth program to another. The crimes continued. The silence was maintained.</p>

<p>And Australia was far from alone. Similar scandals had erupted in the United States, Ireland, Canada, and Belgium. In Ireland, the government had established its own Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in 2000, eventually documenting abuse stretching back to 1936. The problem was global, but every country would have to reckon with it in its own way.</p>

<h2>The States Begin to Act</h2>

<p>Before the federal government stepped in, individual Australian states had been grappling with pieces of this puzzle—though often finding the task overwhelming.</p>

<p>In 1996, Western Australia launched a parliamentary inquiry to review abuse of children in state care. The investigators quickly realized something troubling: the scope was simply too big. There were too many institutions, too many years, too many victims. They couldn't do it justice.</p>

<p>Queensland took a more comprehensive approach. In 1999, former Governor Leneen Forde led a Commission of Inquiry into Abuse of Children in Queensland Institutions. Her team investigated 159 licensed government and non-government institutions spanning nearly a century—from 1911 to 1999. The findings were damning. Abuse had occurred, systematically and extensively. The commission made 42 recommendations.</p>

<p>But it was Victoria that would light the fuse for national action.</p>

<h2>Forty Suicides</h2>

<p>In January 2011, Victoria launched the Protecting Victoria's Vulnerable Children Inquiry, chaired by former Supreme Court Justice Philip Cummins. When the inquiry reported a year later, it made a striking recommendation: there needed to be a formal investigation into how religious organizations responded to criminal abuse of children by their own personnel.</p>

<p>Victoria's parliament established a bipartisan inquiry in May 2012. The questions it sought to answer were pointed: Were victims discouraged from reporting abuse? When they did report, how were they treated? What happened to the perpetrators? Did institutions have adequate policies to prevent abuse—and if not, what reforms were needed?</p>

<p>Then came testimony that shocked even hardened observers.</p>

<p>A police report presented to the inquiry detailed forty suicides directly connected to abuse by Roman Catholic clergy. Forty lives, ended by their own hands, because the pain of what had been done to them—often decades earlier, often by people they had been taught to trust absolutely—had become unbearable.</p>

<p>In October 2012, Victoria's Police Commissioner Ken Lay went further. In his submission to the inquiry, he recommended that certain actions by the Catholic Church should be made criminal offenses. These weren't minor procedural failings. Lay alleged the Church had actively dissuaded victims from reporting to police, failed to cooperate with investigations, and even tipped off suspects about allegations against them.</p>

<p>The pressure for a national royal commission was becoming impossible to ignore.</p>

<h2>A Detective Goes Public</h2>

<p>Peter Fox was a senior detective in the New South Wales Police. He had spent years investigating child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy. And in November 2012, he went public with explosive allegations.</p>

<p>Fox claimed he had been stood down from his investigations while compiling critical evidence. He alleged a systematic cover-up: "The church covers up, silences victims, hinders police investigations, alerts offenders, destroys evidence and moves priests to protect the good name of the church."</p>

<p>He spoke of "the evil of paedophilia within the Catholic Church."</p>

<p>Fox's allegations prompted the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, to announce a Special Commission of Inquiry just days later. This inquiry, led by Margaret Cunneen, focused specifically on police handling of abuse allegations in the Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle.</p>

<p>The inquiry would later find that Fox himself was "not a credible witness" and that his evidence should be "approached with caution." But it also confirmed something else: senior Catholic Church officials, including former Bishop Leo Clarke, had indeed withheld information from police.</p>

<p>The truth, as often happens, was complicated. Fox may have overstated some claims. But the underlying problem he was pointing to was real.</p>

<h2>The Prime Minister Acts</h2>

<p>On November 12, 2012—just three days after the New South Wales inquiry was announced—Prime Minister Julia Gillard made her own announcement. She would recommend to the Governor-General the creation of a national royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>The key word there is "institutional." This wasn't going to be an investigation solely targeting the Catholic Church, though the Church would inevitably be a major focus. The commission's scope would encompass every kind of institution where children might be vulnerable: schools, sporting clubs, government agencies, religious organizations of all denominations, youth groups, orphanages, and more.</p>

<p>The government moved quickly. Within a week, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon and Acting Families Minister Brendan O'Connor released a consultation paper seeking public input on the commission's scope, structure, and timeline.</p>

<p>On January 11, 2013, Governor-General Quentin Bryce issued the formal letters patent establishing the commission. Six commissioners were appointed, led by Peter McClellan, a New South Wales Supreme Court judge with experience chairing major inquiries.</p>

<h2>The Commissioners</h2>

<p>The choice of commissioners reflected the enormity and complexity of the task ahead.</p>

<p>Peter McClellan, the chair, brought experience from the Independent Commission Against Corruption and had led the Sydney Water Inquiry. He understood how to investigate institutional failure.</p>

<p>Bob Atkinson had been Police Commissioner of Queensland during the aftermath of the Fitzgerald Inquiry—a previous royal commission that had exposed widespread police corruption. He knew how institutions could become rotten from within.</p>

<p>Jennifer Coate was a Family Court judge and former president of Victoria's Children's Court. She had spent her career working at the intersection of law and child welfare.</p>

<p>Robert Fitzgerald served on the Productivity Commission and had worked extensively on disability services and Indigenous disadvantage. He understood how government systems could fail vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>Helen Milroy was a consultant psychiatrist specializing in child and adolescent mental health, with particular expertise in Aboriginal health. She could speak to the lasting psychological damage that abuse inflicts.</p>

<p>Andrew Murray was a former Senator from Western Australia who had long advocated on issues affecting institutionalized children. He brought political experience and a deep knowledge of child protection policy.</p>

<p>Together, they represented law enforcement, the judiciary, psychiatry, public policy, and lived experience of reform. They would need all of it.</p>

<h2>An Unprecedented Scope</h2>

<p>The commission was directed to examine how institutions had responded to "allegations and incidents of child sexual abuse and related matters." That phrase—"related matters"—gave the commissioners broad latitude to investigate not just individual crimes, but the systemic failures that allowed those crimes to continue.</p>

<p>Because this was a national inquiry but Australia is a federation, each state had to issue its own letters patent authorizing the commissioners to operate under their laws. This happened state by state through January, February, and March 2013. Western Australia came first on January 22; South Australia came last on March 7.</p>

<p>The commission would ultimately conduct hearings in every capital city and numerous regional centers across the country. It invited members of the public to make submissions in whatever form they felt comfortable: by phone, in writing, or in person.</p>

<p>For many survivors, this was the first time anyone in authority had genuinely wanted to hear their story.</p>

<h2>The Church Responds</h2>

<p>The Catholic Church's response to the announcement revealed the tensions within the institution itself.</p>

<p>Archbishop Denis Hart, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said the Church welcomed the royal commission and promised cooperation. But he also made a claim that would age poorly: that "talk of a systemic problem of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church is ill-founded and inconsistent with the facts."</p>

<p>Cardinal George Pell—then the most senior Catholic clergyman in Australia—expressed hope that the commission would end what he called a "smear campaign" against the Church. In a press conference the day after the announcement, he voiced support for the inquiry and said it offered an opportunity to "help victims and clear the air."</p>

<p>Not everyone in the Church hierarchy appreciated this framing. Bishop Geoffrey Robinson publicly called Pell "a great embarrassment to me and to a lot of good Catholic people."</p>

<p>The Church did take one concrete step toward engagement: it established the Truth, Justice and Healing Council to coordinate its response to the commission. The council was initially chaired by Barry O'Keefe, a former judge. When O'Keefe died in 2014, he was succeeded by Neville Owen, another former judge.</p>

<p>The name—Truth, Justice and Healing—suggested the Church understood that something profound had gone wrong. Whether the institution could genuinely reckon with that wrong remained to be seen.</p>

<h2>What the Commission Found</h2>

<p>The commission's work would span nearly five years, with the final report released on December 15, 2017. What it documented was staggering in scale.</p>

<p>Consider just one finding: the commission detailed abuse claims against ten religious orders covering the period from 1950 to 2010. In four of those orders, allegations had been made against more than twenty percent of their members.</p>

<p>Let that sink in. In some religious orders, more than one in five members faced allegations of child sexual abuse.</p>

<p>The commission received thousands of submissions from individuals, organizations, and government agencies. Survivors groups from places like Ballarat—a regional Victorian city that would become synonymous with clergy abuse—told their stories. Major institutions including the Anglican Church, the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church, Scouts Australia, and numerous Catholic organizations all engaged with the inquiry. Every state government submitted evidence. So did the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Human Rights Commission, and dozens of other agencies.</p>

<p>The legal support was unprecedented too. The Attorney-General arranged for free legal services through the National Association of Community Legal Centres, ensuring that survivors who wanted to give evidence could have independent legal advice—something that mattered enormously for people who had learned not to trust institutions.</p>

<h2>The Question of Justice</h2>

<p>A royal commission is not a court. It cannot convict anyone or send anyone to prison. Its power lies in uncovering truth and making recommendations.</p>

<p>But the evidence gathered by the commission could be—and was—used in subsequent criminal prosecutions. Perpetrators who had evaded justice for decades finally faced courts. Institutional leaders who had enabled cover-ups found their actions exposed to public scrutiny.</p>

<p>The commission also examined something that criminal courts rarely address: what should institutions do differently to prevent future abuse? Its recommendations covered everything from screening procedures for people who work with children, to mandatory reporting requirements, to the specific reforms that religious organizations should implement.</p>

<p>One particularly pointed recommendation addressed the Catholic seal of confession—the principle that priests cannot reveal anything disclosed during confession, no matter how serious. The commission recommended that this should not exempt clergy from mandatory reporting requirements for child abuse. The Church resisted this recommendation fiercely, arguing it would violate fundamental religious principles. The debate continues.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters Beyond Australia</h2>

<p>The Australian Royal Commission became a model for how democracies can confront institutional failures of this magnitude. Other countries watched its proceedings closely.</p>

<p>What made it effective wasn't just its legal powers, though those were essential. It was the combination of official authority with genuine accessibility to survivors. People could tell their stories in public hearings if they wanted that visibility, or in private sessions if they needed that protection. They could write letters or make phone calls or sit down with commissioners in person.</p>

<p>The commission also demonstrated something important about the nature of institutional abuse: it's rarely about a few "bad apples." The patterns revealed were systemic. Institutions across different sectors and different religious traditions had developed remarkably similar ways of protecting themselves at the expense of the children in their care. They shuffled abusers around. They discouraged reporting. They prioritized reputation over safety.</p>

<p>Understanding this systemic dimension was crucial. Individual prosecutions matter, but they don't prevent future abuse if the institutional dynamics that enabled it remain unchanged.</p>

<h2>The Journalist Who Started It All</h2>

<p>It's worth returning to where this began: not in parliament, but in journalism.</p>

<p>Joanne McCarthy was a reporter for the Newcastle Herald. Her coverage of John Pirona's death and the broader pattern of clergy abuse in the Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle powered the "Shine the Light" campaign that ultimately pushed the federal government to act.</p>

<p>The Special Commission of Inquiry in New South Wales had centered on internal church documents that McCarthy obtained—documents revealing how senior clergy had allegedly attempted to conceal the crimes of Father Denis McAlinden, described as "a prolific paedophile."</p>

<p>McCarthy's work exemplifies what investigative journalism can achieve: she made it impossible for powerful institutions to maintain their silence. Without her reporting, without the public pressure that followed, the royal commission might never have happened.</p>

<h2>Living with the Legacy</h2>

<p>The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse ended its work in 2017, but its effects continue to ripple through Australian society.</p>

<p>Survivors who never thought they would be believed finally had their experiences officially acknowledged. Institutions that had prioritized self-protection were forced to implement reforms. Laws were changed. Attitudes shifted—at least somewhat.</p>

<p>But healing is not a neat process. Many survivors still struggle with the lasting effects of what was done to them. Some never received adequate compensation. Some never saw their abusers face justice. The forty suicides documented in Victoria were just a fraction of the lives cut short or diminished by childhood abuse.</p>

<p>The commission's final report runs to thousands of pages. It represents the most comprehensive accounting ever undertaken of how Australian institutions failed children and what must change to prevent such failures in the future.</p>

<p>Whether those recommendations are fully implemented—whether institutions genuinely transform or merely make cosmetic changes—remains an ongoing question. Royal commissions can uncover truth and propose solutions. They cannot force societies to change.</p>

<p>That part is up to all of us.</p>
