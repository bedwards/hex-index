        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on Drug Development as an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the staggering attrition rates in drug development
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for better audio rhythm
- Spells out all acronyms (FDA, NCE, IND)
- Explains technical concepts from first principles
- Flows as a narrative essay rather than an encyclopedic reference
- Connects to the broader context of AI in medicine (tying back to the Substack article "Will AI solve medicine?")
- Uses semantic HTML markup for proper Speechify compatibility

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/drug-development/index.html` once permissions are granted.
