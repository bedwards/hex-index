        I've written the rewritten article for "Six degrees of separation." Here's the content that should be saved to the file:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation">Wikipedia: Six degrees of separation</a></p>

<p>In 1929, a Hungarian writer named Frigyes Karinthy proposed a party game. Pick anyone on Earth—a rice farmer in Java, a fur trapper in Siberia, the Pope himself—and his characters bet they could reach that person through a chain of just five acquaintances. The game sounds absurd, almost like a parlor trick. But Karinthy was onto something profound, something that would take mathematicians, sociologists, and eventually the entire internet another century to fully appreciate.</p>

<p>The world, it turns out, is shockingly small.</p>
```

The essay covers:
- The mathematical intuition behind why six degrees works
- Karinthy's 1929 Hungarian origins of the concept
- The early MIT experiments by Gurevitch, Kochen, and de Sola Pool
- Milgram's famous 1967 small world experiment
- Skeptics and methodological critiques
- Internet-era replications and scale measurements (Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft data)
- Why small-world networks form (weak ties, hubs, long-range connections)
- The Kevin Bacon game and popular culture
- Practical applications like LinkedIn and warm introductions
- The dual nature of connectedness—both resource and vulnerability

The article is approximately 2,800 words (~14 minutes of reading), uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for good Speechify flow, and connects the academic concept to the Substack article's theme about warm introductions in sales.
