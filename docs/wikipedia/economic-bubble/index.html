        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article on economic bubbles. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I created:

**Key features of the rewrite:**

1. **Engaging hook** - Opens with the vivid story of Dutch tulip mania rather than a dry definition
2. **Varied paragraph lengths** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs ("It never is.") with longer explanatory sections
3. **Plain language** - Explains technical terms like "intrinsic value" immediately after introducing them
4. **Narrative flow** - Uses transitions to guide readers through the concepts logically
5. **Substantive content** - Approximately 3,000 words covering all major aspects: bubble types, wealth effects, central bank responses, reflexivity theory, experimental findings, and prevention measures

**Section structure:**
- What Makes a Bubble a Bubble
- The Word Itself (etymology from South Sea Bubble)
- Two Flavors of Bubble (equity vs debt)
- The Wealth Effect and Its Evil Twin
- The Fed and the Punch Bowl
- The Strange Loop of Reflexivity (Soros's theory)
- The Laboratory of Bubbles (experimental economics)
- Greater Fools and True Believers
- Too Much Money Chasing Too Few Assets
- What Happens When Bubbles Burst
- Can Bubbles Be Prevented?
- The Eternal Recurrence (conclusion)
