        I've written the Wikipedia article rewrite about initial public offerings. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with the dramatic theglobe.com story as a hook
- Explains the IPO process from first principles
- Traces the history from Roman publicani to modern markets
- Covers the benefits, costs, and mechanics in accessible language
- Discusses the underwriting process and pricing challenges
- Includes the human drama behind these financial events
- Avoids jargon while still being substantive

The content is approximately 2,500 words, suitable for 10-15 minutes of reading/listening, with semantic HTML markup optimized for Speechify text-to-speech.
