        I've written the Tyco Toys Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with the fascinating Garfield phone beach mystery as a hook
- Traces the company from 1926 Mantua Metal Products through its 1997 Mattel acquisition
- Explains technical terms (HO scale, slot cars) from first principles
- Varies sentence and paragraph length for good audio rhythm
- Covers the corporate governance scandal, Tickle Me Elmo phenomenon, and various product lines
- Closes by circling back to those Garfield phones

The file is ready to be written to `docs/wikipedia/tyco-toys/index.html` once you grant write permissions.
