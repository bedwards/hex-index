<h2>The Man Who Broke the Pattern</h2>

<p>In January 2019, something happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo that had never happened before in the country's nearly six decades of independence. A sitting president peacefully handed power to an opposition leader.</p>

<p>That might not sound remarkable. In stable democracies, it happens every few years like clockwork. But the Congo is not a stable democracy. Since gaining independence from Belgium in 1960, the country had seen coups, assassinations, civil wars, and dictators who clung to power until they were forced out at gunpoint or died in office. The peaceful transfer of power—the cornerstone of any functioning democracy—had simply never occurred.</p>

<p>The man who received that historic handover was Félix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo. Understanding how he got there, and what he has done since, tells us a great deal about the Congo's turbulent politics, its strategic importance in the global scramble for critical minerals, and the complicated dance between democracy and pragmatism that defines so much of African governance.</p>

<h2>Born Into Opposition</h2>

<p>Félix Tshisekedi was born in Kinshasa on June 13, 1963, into a family that would become synonymous with opposition politics in the Congo. His father, Étienne Tshisekedi, was a towering figure in Congolese history—a man who served three times as Prime Minister of Zaire (as the country was then called) and spent decades as the leading voice against the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>

<p>Mobutu ruled the Congo with an iron fist from 1965 to 1997. He renamed the country Zaire, amassed a personal fortune while the nation crumbled, and tolerated no meaningful opposition. When Étienne Tshisekedi founded the Union for Democracy and Social Progress—known by its French acronym UDPS—in the early 1980s, he was directly challenging one of Africa's most ruthless dictators.</p>

<p>The price was steep. The elder Tshisekedi was placed under house arrest in his native village in the Kasaï region, deep in the country's interior. His family, including the young Félix, was forced to accompany him. Félix's education was interrupted. His comfortable childhood in the capital gave way to years of isolation and surveillance.</p>

<p>In 1985, Mobutu allowed Félix, his mother Marthe, and his brothers to leave Kasaï. But the experience had shaped him. He had seen firsthand what it meant to stand against power, and what it cost.</p>

<h2>The Long Apprenticeship</h2>

<p>Félix Tshisekedi spent decades in the shadow of his famous father. The UDPS remained the country's largest and oldest opposition party, a constant thorn in the side of whoever held power in Kinshasa. When Mobutu was finally overthrown in 1997 by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, and when Laurent's son Joseph Kabila took over after his father's assassination in 2001, the UDPS remained in opposition.</p>

<p>In 2008, Félix was named the party's National Secretary for external relations. In 2011, he won a seat in the National Assembly representing Mbuji Mayi, a major city in the Kasaï region. But he never actually took his seat. He claimed the election had been fraudulent, and his mandate was eventually invalidated because he simply never showed up.</p>

<p>This was a pattern in Congolese opposition politics—refusing to participate in institutions they viewed as illegitimate, even when they won. It was principled, but it also left them perpetually on the outside.</p>

<p>In 2016, Félix became vice secretary general of the UDPS. Then, on February 1, 2017, his father died. The man who had spent nearly four decades fighting for democracy in the Congo never saw his ultimate goal achieved. He was eighty-four years old.</p>

<p>On March 31, 2018, Félix was elected to lead the UDPS in his father's place. The same day, the party nominated him for president.</p>

<h2>A Contested Victory</h2>

<p>The December 2018 election was supposed to happen years earlier. Joseph Kabila's second term had ended in 2016, and under the constitution, he could not run again. But he delayed the election repeatedly, clinging to power as protests erupted across the country.</p>

<p>When the vote finally happened, three main candidates competed. There was Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, Kabila's chosen successor, backed by the full machinery of the ruling party. There was Martin Fayulu, a businessman and opposition figure who had secured endorsements from other major opposition leaders. And there was Félix Tshisekedi.</p>

<p>On January 10, 2019, the electoral commission announced that Tshisekedi had won.</p>

<p>Almost immediately, the result was disputed. Election monitoring organizations, including the respected Catholic Church, which had deployed 40,000 observers across the country, suggested that the numbers didn't add up. Their data indicated that Fayulu had actually won by a wide margin. The African Union and the European Union expressed serious doubts.</p>

<p>Fayulu challenged the result in the Constitutional Court. On January 19, the court dismissed his challenge, officially making Tshisekedi the president-elect. Five days later, he was sworn in.</p>

<p>Many observers suspected a deal had been struck. Kabila couldn't stay in power himself, and his chosen successor had clearly lost. But if he allowed a genuine opposition victory, he risked prosecution for the corruption and human rights abuses of his eighteen-year rule. By allegedly cutting a deal with Tshisekedi—allowing him to take the presidency in exchange for protection and continued influence—Kabila might have found a way to have it both ways.</p>

<p>Neither man has ever confirmed such an arrangement. But what happened next seemed to support the theory.</p>

<h2>President Without Power</h2>

<p>Félix Tshisekedi took office in January 2019. But taking office and holding power are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Kabila's coalition, called the Common Front for Congo (known by its French initials FCC), still controlled the National Assembly, the Senate, and most of the country's provincial governorships. Tshisekedi couldn't even appoint his own prime minister without their approval.</p>

<p>He had wanted to make Vital Kamerhe, a political heavyweight who had joined his coalition, the prime minister. But he didn't have the parliamentary votes to make it happen. Instead, Kamerhe became his chief of cabinet—an important position, but not the one either man had planned.</p>

<p>For months, Tshisekedi had to work with ministers appointed by his predecessor. He faced enormous challenges: ongoing conflict in the eastern provinces, where dozens of armed groups continued to fight, and a deadly Ebola outbreak that was killing hundreds. But his hands were tied.</p>

<p>In May 2019, he finally reached a deal with Kabila's coalition to appoint a prime minister. The choice was revealing: Sylvestre Ilunga, a career civil servant who had held cabinet positions under Mobutu before his overthrow and was an ally of Kabila. This was not an independent appointment. It was the price of governing.</p>

<p>When the new cabinet was formed in July 2019, it had sixty-five members—forty-eight ministers and seventeen vice-ministers. The majority went to Kabila's FCC coalition. They controlled the key ministries of Defense, Justice, and Finance. Tshisekedi's allies got Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Budget. It was a divided government, with the president as the junior partner.</p>

<h2>Breaking Free</h2>

<p>The arrangement was never going to be stable. A president with popular legitimacy but no real power, forced to share governance with the coalition of his predecessor—this was a recipe for constant tension.</p>

<p>Over the next two years, Tshisekedi worked to build his own power base. He courted legislators, making offers and building alliances. Slowly, members of parliament began to switch sides. The Kabila coalition started to fracture.</p>

<p>In February 2021, Tshisekedi made his move. He forced out Prime Minister Ilunga and appointed a successor: Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde, who had been heading Gécamines, the state mining company. In April 2021, Sama Lukonde formed a new government, and Tshisekedi formally ended his coalition with Kabila.</p>

<p>The president announced a series of new appointments, including Antoinette N'Samba Kalambayi as mines minister. One by one, the last officials loyal to Kabila were removed. After more than two years of constrained governance, Tshisekedi finally had something approaching full control.</p>

<h2>The Second Term</h2>

<p>In December 2023, Tshisekedi ran for re-election. This time, there was no ambiguity about the margin. He won with 73 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>Nine opposition candidates signed a declaration rejecting the result and calling for a new election. But there was no Constitutional Court challenge, no sustained protests. Tshisekedi's hold on power was now secure in a way it had never been before.</p>

<p>The journey from contested first-term winner to landslide second-term victor was remarkable. Whether it represented genuine popularity, effective use of incumbency advantages, or continued flaws in the electoral system depends on who you ask.</p>

<h2>The Minerals Question</h2>

<p>To understand why the world pays attention to Congolese politics, you have to understand what lies beneath Congolese soil.</p>

<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the most mineral-rich countries on Earth. It produces about 70 percent of the world's cobalt, a metal essential for the lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles and smartphones. It has vast reserves of copper, uranium, coltan (used in electronics), diamonds, gold, and more.</p>

<p>During Joseph Kabila's long presidency, Chinese companies established a dominant position in the Congolese mining sector. The most significant deal was known as Sicomines—a "minerals-for-infrastructure" arrangement in which Chinese state-owned companies agreed to build roads, hospitals, and other infrastructure in exchange for mining rights worth billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Tshisekedi has taken a different approach. He has called for a review of the mining contracts signed with China, arguing that the country did not get a fair deal. He has sought to diversify the Congo's partnerships, courting Western governments and companies.</p>

<p>In a sign of how central minerals have become to great power competition, Tshisekedi visited China in May 2023 to meet with President Xi Jinping and renegotiate mining terms. But he has also engaged with the United States and European countries, trying to leverage the Congo's resources for better terms from everyone.</p>

<p>This is the context for the recent U.S.-DRC mining deal that has drawn so much attention. The Congo has something everyone wants. The question is who will get access to it, on what terms, and what the Congolese people will get in return.</p>

<h2>The War That Won't End</h2>

<p>While Tshisekedi negotiates mining deals and consolidates political power, the eastern provinces of his country are on fire.</p>

<p>The conflict in eastern Congo is one of the world's deadliest and most complicated. It involves dozens of armed groups, some domestic and some backed by neighboring countries, fighting for control of territory, resources, and ethnic dominance. Millions of people have been displaced. The death toll, when you include deaths from disease and malnutrition caused by the conflict, runs into the millions.</p>

<p>The most significant rebel group is called M23. It is widely believed to be backed by Rwanda, the small but militarily capable country to the Congo's east. Rwanda denies this, but the evidence from United Nations investigators and others is extensive.</p>

<p>In January 2025, the conflict escalated dramatically. M23 fighters, with Rwandan support, launched an offensive that captured the city of Goma, a major population center in eastern Congo. The fall of Goma was a humiliation for the Congolese government and a humanitarian catastrophe for its residents.</p>

<p>Tshisekedi's response was fierce. He severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda. He called for national mobilization, urging citizens to rally behind the Congolese armed forces against what he called "Rwanda's barbaric aggression." He refused to negotiate with M23, saying that legitimizing "these criminals would be an insult to the victims and to international law."</p>

<p>The conflict has also shaped Tshisekedi's relationships with other countries. In October 2024, he walked out of a summit of French-speaking countries in Paris when French President Emmanuel Macron failed to mention the eastern Congo conflict in his speech. He boycotted a luncheon hosted by the head of the international Francophone organization—notably, a former Rwandan foreign minister.</p>

<h2>Building an Army</h2>

<p>One of Tshisekedi's most significant domestic initiatives has been military reform. The Congolese armed forces have historically been weak, fragmented, and sometimes predatory toward the very civilians they are supposed to protect.</p>

<p>The problem dates back decades. After the wars of the late 1990s and early 2000s, various rebel groups were integrated into the national army as part of peace agreements. But integration on paper didn't mean integration in reality. Different units maintained loyalty to their former commanders. Discipline was poor. Pay was irregular. Soldiers sometimes looted and abused civilians.</p>

<p>In October 2022, Tshisekedi announced reforms aimed at creating a more cohesive national force. This included new military spending, appointment of new military commanders, and an explicit rejection of one option that had been floated: hiring Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group to help fight in the east.</p>

<p>Wagner, now rebranded after its founder's death, has established a significant presence in several African countries, offering military support to governments in exchange for mining concessions and other benefits. Tshisekedi said no. Instead, he brought in Romanian private military contractors and additional peacekeepers from regional organizations.</p>

<p>Whether these reforms will be enough to turn the tide in eastern Congo remains to be seen. The challenge is immense. But the effort represents a recognition that the Congo cannot simply rely on international peacekeepers forever. At some point, the country must be able to defend itself.</p>

<h2>Climate and Forests</h2>

<p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo contains the world's second-largest rainforest, after the Amazon. The Congo Basin forest is one of the planet's great carbon sinks, absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and helping to regulate the global climate.</p>

<p>At the 2021 United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, known as COP26, Tshisekedi made a significant commitment. The Congo pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030. This was part of the summit's first major agreement, with more than 100 countries making similar pledges.</p>

<p>The promise is both environmentally crucial and politically complex. The Congo's forests are under pressure from logging, mining, agriculture, and simple poverty—people who clear trees because they need land to farm or wood to burn. Protecting the forest while meeting the needs of one of the world's poorest populations is an enormous challenge.</p>

<p>It also raises questions of global equity. Wealthy countries industrialized by burning fossil fuels and clearing their own forests. Now they are asking countries like the Congo to preserve their forests for the benefit of the global climate. What compensation should the Congo receive? What right do wealthy nations have to tell poorer ones how to use their resources?</p>

<p>These are questions without easy answers. But they ensure that Congolese environmental policy is a matter of global interest, not just local concern.</p>

<h2>The Coup That Failed</h2>

<p>On May 19, 2024, a group of armed men attempted to seize power in Kinshasa. They called themselves representatives of "New Zaire"—a reference to the name Mobutu had given the country, which was abandoned after his overthrow.</p>

<p>The group was led by Christian Malanga, an opposition politician who had been living in the United States. Their targets were President Tshisekedi and his ally Vital Kamerhe.</p>

<p>The coup failed quickly. Congolese security forces responded within hours. Six people were killed in the fighting, including Malanga himself. Within a day, the situation was under control.</p>

<p>The episode was a reminder that Congolese politics, for all its recent stability, remains volatile. The peaceful transfer of power in 2019 was historic. But it did not mean that violence had been banished from political competition. The country's history of coups, rebellions, and civil wars casts a long shadow.</p>

<h2>The Weight of Legacy</h2>

<p>Félix Tshisekedi carries the weight of his father's legacy and the burden of his country's history. Étienne Tshisekedi spent nearly forty years fighting for democracy in the Congo. He never achieved it in his lifetime. Now his son sits in the presidency, the first opposition leader to gain power through an election.</p>

<p>But what kind of democracy has the Congo become? The 2018 election that brought Tshisekedi to power was deeply flawed, possibly stolen. The 2023 election that gave him a second term was more decisive but still questioned by opponents. The eastern provinces are ungovernable, wracked by violence. Corruption remains endemic. Poverty is crushing.</p>

<p>And yet, there has also been progress. Power has been transferred peacefully—twice now, if you count Tshisekedi's re-election. The Kabila era appears to be genuinely over. The president has consolidated power and is governing, for better or worse, rather than merely sharing space with his predecessor's appointees.</p>

<p>The mining wealth that makes the Congo so strategically important also offers a path to prosperity, if the proceeds can be captured for the benefit of Congolese citizens rather than foreign companies and corrupt elites. The forests that cover so much of the country are a global resource, and the world's willingness to pay for their preservation could become a significant source of income.</p>

<p>Félix Tshisekedi is sixty-two years old. If he serves out his second term, he will leave office in 2029—or perhaps he will find a way to stay longer, as so many African leaders have. His story is not finished. Neither is the Congo's.</p>

<p>But for now, he stands as something his country has rarely seen: a president who came to power through an election, who was not installed by foreign powers or victorious in civil war, and who has managed to survive and even thrive in one of the world's most difficult political environments. Whether that makes him a democrat, a pragmatist, or something else entirely depends on how the story ends.</p>
