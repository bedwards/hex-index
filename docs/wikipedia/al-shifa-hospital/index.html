        The article has been written. Here's a summary:

**Al-Shifa Hospital Essay (~2,400 words)**

The rewrite transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into a narrative essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. Key choices:

1. **Opening hook**: Leads with the irony of Israel building bunkers that it later bombed, immediately capturing the reader's attention

2. **Chronological narrative**: Traces the hospital through British Mandate → Egyptian administration → Israeli occupation → Hamas control → 2023 destruction

3. **Varied pacing**: Short punchy paragraphs ("Then came 1967.") mixed with longer explanatory sections

4. **Plain language**: Explains terms like "dunam" (twelve and a half acres), avoids unexplained jargon

5. **Balanced presentation**: Presents both Israeli claims and counter-evidence from medical workers and human rights organizations

6. **Thematic conclusion**: Uses the "palimpsest" metaphor to tie together the hospital's layered history, ending on the meaning of its name

The HTML uses semantic markup (h2 headings, proper paragraphs, no empty elements) for clean Speechify rendering.
