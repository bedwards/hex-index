        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Homebrew Computer Club Wikipedia article. The essay is ready to be saved once permissions are granted. Here's a summary of what I created:

**Title:** Homebrew Computer Club

**Word count:** Approximately 3,500 words (~15-20 minutes read time)

**Structure:**
- Opens with a vivid hook about the March 1975 meeting and its significance
- Sections covering: the garage origins, the meeting format and culture, the Oasis bar gatherings, a detailed roll call of notable members, the influential newsletter, Paul Terrell's crucial role, why Silicon Valley was uniquely positioned for this revolution, the club's end and legacy, and a nuanced conclusion about the mythology

**Key improvements over the Wikipedia source:**
- Narrative flow rather than encyclopedic style
- All acronyms spelled out (MITS, SLAC, BASIC)
- Technical concepts explained from first principles (what mainframes were, how the Altair worked)
- Rich context about why this happened when and where it did
- Interesting connections (the Osborne effect, phone phreaking, the irony of The Oasis becoming a VC firm)
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good audio listening
- Critical perspective on the Silicon Valley mythology while acknowledging genuine inspiration

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/homebrew-computer-club/index.html` once you grant the necessary permissions.
