<p>The trains have no drivers. This is the first thing you notice about the Docklands Light Railway, and it remains slightly unnerving even after you've ridden it a hundred times. You can sit right at the front, where the driver's seat would be on any normal train, and watch the tracks stretch out ahead of you while the computer does all the work. Children love it. Adults pretend not to.</p>

<p>But here's what makes this driverless railway genuinely remarkable: it opened in 1987, years before most people had heard of the internet, when the idea of trusting a computer to carry you through London at speed seemed like science fiction. The Docklands Light Railway wasn't just an experiment in automation. It was a gamble on an entire philosophy of urban development—and against all odds, it worked.</p>

<h2>From Empire to Emptiness</h2>

<p>To understand why London needed a driverless railway cutting through its eastern reaches, you need to understand what the Docklands used to be.</p>

<p>For two centuries, the docks east of the City of London were the beating heart of British trade. Ships from every corner of the empire unloaded their cargo here—tea from India, wool from Australia, timber from Canada, sugar from the Caribbean. The Royal Docks, the last and largest of them, opened in 1921 and could handle the biggest vessels afloat.</p>

<p>Then containerisation happened.</p>

<p>Starting in the early 1960s, shipping transformed almost overnight. The old system—where dockers manually loaded and unloaded loose cargo—couldn't compete with standardised metal boxes that could be lifted directly from ship to truck. The older docks were too cramped to handle container cranes. Their channels were too shallow for the new generation of massive container ships. By the mid-1970s, new deep-water facilities at Tilbury, further down the Thames in Essex, had taken over.</p>

<p>The Royal Docks closed for good in 1981. What remained was eight square miles of dereliction in the middle of one of the world's great cities—abandoned warehouses, stagnant water, and thousands of unemployed dockers with no obvious future.</p>

<h2>A Railway That Nobody Wanted to Build</h2>

<p>Everyone agreed something had to be done. Figuring out what, exactly, proved considerably harder.</p>

<p>The obvious solution was a proper underground railway. London Transport already had plans to extend the Jubilee line through the Docklands, connecting the area to central London and continuing all the way to Woolwich Arsenal. The route would have served the Isle of Dogs, the peninsula jutting into a loop of the Thames that would later become home to Canary Wharf. The estimated cost in the mid-1970s: around 325 million pounds.</p>

<p>Margaret Thatcher's government, which came to power in 1979, had other ideas. A full underground railway seemed extravagantly expensive for an area with no current passengers and uncertain future development. The government wanted something cheaper. Much cheaper.</p>

<p>In 1981, the newly created London Docklands Development Corporation commissioned a study of light rail options—something more like a tram than a tube train. The budget would be 77 million pounds, less than a quarter of what the Jubilee line extension would cost. There would be no ongoing government subsidy. Whatever got built would have to pay for itself.</p>

<h2>Building on the Bones</h2>

<p>The engineers faced an obvious question: how do you build a railway on a shoestring budget?</p>

<p>The answer lay in what the docks had left behind. An old railway line called the London and Blackwall Railway had once served the area, connecting the docks to the mainline network. It closed in 1966, but its viaducts still stood. Similarly, stretches of track running out from Liverpool Street station to the northeast passed through the area on elevated structures that were being underused.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the new railway could simply reuse existing infrastructure—Victorian viaducts repurposed for a computer-controlled train system that the Victorians could never have imagined.</p>

<p>This is a peculiarly British approach to innovation. Rather than starting from scratch, the Docklands Light Railway was threaded through the archaeological remains of an earlier industrial age. The contrast is striking: space-age automation running on tracks supported by brickwork laid down when Queen Victoria sat on the throne.</p>

<h2>The Automation Gamble</h2>

<p>The original plan called for manual operation with some sections of street running, where trains would share roads with cars and pedestrians like a conventional tram. But the London Docklands Development Corporation pushed for something more ambitious. They wanted fully automated operation—trains controlled entirely by computer, with no human driver making decisions.</p>

<p>This was genuinely radical in 1984, when the construction contract was awarded. Automated people-movers existed at airports, carrying passengers short distances between terminals. But a fully automated railway covering miles of track through an urban environment, crossing junctions, adjusting for delays, responding to emergencies—this was largely untested territory.</p>

<p>The contract went to a joint venture between General Electric Company and John Mowlem. They proposed using light rail vehicles from the German manufacturer Linke-Hofmann-Busch, adapted for driverless operation. Each train would carry a Passenger Service Agent—originally called a "Train Captain"—who would patrol the carriages, check tickets, make announcements, and control the doors. Crucially, the agent could take manual control if something went wrong. But under normal circumstances, every aspect of driving would be handled by the computer system.</p>

<p>Eleven of these original trains were built. They were small by London standards—just a single articulated unit, shorter than a tube train carriage. The stations were designed to match, with platforms barely long enough to accommodate one vehicle.</p>

<h2>Opening Day</h2>

<p>Queen Elizabeth II formally opened the Docklands Light Railway on 30 July 1987. Passenger service began a month later, on 31 August.</p>

<p>The initial network was modest: two routes totalling about twelve kilometres, connecting fifteen stations. One line ran from Tower Gateway—a new terminus built near the Tower of London—down through the Isle of Dogs to Island Gardens at the southern tip of the peninsula, where a Victorian foot tunnel allowed pedestrians to walk under the Thames to Greenwich. The other ran from Stratford, an existing mainline station to the northeast, joining the first route before continuing to Island Gardens.</p>

<p>The whole thing formed a triangle, with a junction near Poplar where the two branches met. For the first few years, this was all there was.</p>

<p>And for the first few years, it was more than enough. The Docklands remained largely empty. A London Transport report from 1981 had warned that without major development around Canary Wharf, the area would be "very isolated with poor traffic prospects." That assessment proved accurate. The new railway ran through a landscape of derelict warehouses and vacant lots, serving passengers who hadn't yet arrived.</p>

<h2>Canary Wharf Changes Everything</h2>

<p>Then the developers came.</p>

<p>Canary Wharf had been a wharf for—as the name suggests—goods arriving from the Canary Islands, mainly tomatoes and bananas. By the late 1980s, it was a derelict site surrounded by other derelict sites. A Canadian development company called Olympia & York saw opportunity where others saw only decay. They would build a new financial district, a gleaming forest of skyscrapers to rival the City of London itself.</p>

<p>The first phase of Canary Wharf opened in 1991. One Canada Square, the tower at its heart, was briefly the tallest building in Britain. Suddenly the Docklands Light Railway was carrying not occasional explorers of post-industrial wasteland but thousands of bankers, traders, and office workers commuting to jobs in glass towers that hadn't existed five years earlier.</p>

<p>The railway struggled to cope. Stations and trains designed for single-vehicle operation were overwhelmed by rush-hour crowds. The original Canary Wharf station—a modest wayside halt—was completely inadequate for the traffic now descending on it. Tower Gateway, the City of London terminus, attracted fierce criticism for its poor connections; it stood isolated from both Tower Hill tube station and Fenchurch Street mainline station, requiring passengers to walk between them.</p>

<p>The Docklands Light Railway had been built too small. It needed to grow.</p>

<h2>Going Underground</h2>

<p>The solution to Tower Gateway's inadequacy was to abandon it—or at least, to relegate it to secondary status. A new terminus would be built at Bank, in the absolute heart of the City of London, where passengers could connect to multiple tube lines and the mainline railways at nearby stations.</p>

<p>This meant building a tunnel. The Docklands Light Railway, designed as a cheap elevated railway, would burrow underground into some of the most expensive real estate on Earth.</p>

<p>The Bank extension opened in 1991, four years after the original system. It cost 295 million pounds—nearly four times the entire budget for the initial railway. The original trains, it turned out, didn't meet the fire safety regulations required for underground operation; they couldn't be used in the new tunnel. They continued running on the above-ground sections for a while, then were sold off.</p>

<p>At Canary Wharf, the modest original station was demolished and replaced by something far grander: a six-platform, three-track station with an enormous roof, integrated into the shopping malls beneath the office towers. The transformation from lightweight railway to major urban transit system was underway.</p>

<h2>Reaching for the Edges</h2>

<p>With the Bank extension proving that growth was possible, the railway began extending in multiple directions.</p>

<p>In 1994, a new branch opened to Beckton, running east from Poplar through Canning Town and along the northern edge of the Royal Docks complex. This was speculative infrastructure—building railway capacity in advance of development, hoping that the trains would attract passengers rather than the other way around. Two planned stations were initially omitted because planners doubted anyone would use them. A new depot at Beckton replaced the original, smaller facility at Poplar.</p>

<p>The junction arrangements grew more complex. The original flat triangle at Poplar was replaced with grade-separated junctions—where lines cross at different levels rather than at the same height—to handle the increased traffic without trains getting in each other's way.</p>

<p>Then the railway did something it had never been designed to do: it crossed the river.</p>

<h2>Under the Thames</h2>

<p>Lewisham, a major town centre south of the river with its own mainline station, had long wanted a connection to the growing Docklands network. A feasibility study in the early 1990s suggested extending the railway from the Isle of Dogs, under the Thames, through Greenwich and Deptford to Lewisham station.</p>

<p>This would be expensive—about 200 million pounds—but a new funding mechanism made it possible. The Private Finance Initiative, beloved by governments of the 1990s, allowed private companies to design, build, finance, and maintain public infrastructure. The government contributed around 50 million pounds; private investors covered the rest, expecting to recoup their money through operating revenues over subsequent decades.</p>

<p>Construction began in 1996. The extension opened in November 1999, ahead of schedule—a rare achievement for major railway projects.</p>

<p>The engineering was ingenious. South of Crossharbour, the line dropped gradually to Mudchute, where a street-level station replaced the original high-level platforms. Then it entered a tunnel, following the alignment of the old London and Blackwall Railway viaduct. A shallow underground station at Island Gardens replaced the original elevated one. The line passed beneath the Thames to emerge at Cutty Sark, in the heart of Greenwich, within sight of the famous tea clipper ship that gives the station its name.</p>

<p>At Greenwich station, the line surfaced to allow cross-platform interchange with mainline trains. It then wound on a concrete viaduct to Deptford Bridge before descending to street level at Elverson Road and finally diving beneath the mainline tracks to reach new platforms at Lewisham station.</p>

<p>The extension was an immediate success. For residents of southeast London, it offered a fast, frequent connection to the City and Canary Wharf that didn't require navigating the congested roads or relying on infrequent overground trains.</p>

<h2>Serving the Airport</h2>

<p>London City Airport had opened in 1987, the same year as the Docklands Light Railway, on a strip of land between the Royal Albert and King George V Docks. It catered primarily to business travellers, offering short flights to European financial centres. Its runway was short enough that only specially adapted aircraft could use it, approaching at unusually steep angles to clear the surrounding buildings.</p>

<p>The airport desperately needed rail access. Various schemes were proposed through the 1990s, including an elevated walkway from Royal Albert station and a lift bridge over the dock water. Eventually, a more conventional solution prevailed: a new branch from Canning Town running along the southern edge of the Royal Docks to stations at West Silvertown, Pontoon Dock, and London City Airport itself, before continuing to King George V.</p>

<p>This branch opened in December 2005. Three years later, in January 2009, it extended further still, tunnelling under the Thames to reach Woolwich Arsenal station on the south bank. Woolwich Arsenal was already a major transport hub, served by mainline trains and buses. The Docklands Light Railway connection finally linked it to Canary Wharf and the City without requiring passengers to travel into central London and back out again.</p>

<h2>How It Works Today</h2>

<p>Nearly four decades after its opening, the Docklands Light Railway has grown to 38 kilometres of track—more than three times its original length—serving areas its designers never imagined.</p>

<p>The system operates 149 trains, all driverless. Normal operations are fully automated: computers control acceleration, braking, routing, and station stops. Passenger Service Agents still ride the trains, checking tickets and managing doors, and can take manual control when necessary. But the fundamental principle of 1987—that a computer can safely drive a train through a major city—has been vindicated by decades of reliable operation.</p>

<p>Four stations are underground: Bank, Island Gardens, Cutty Sark, and Woolwich Arsenal. These are staffed continuously, as required by safety regulations for underground stations. The above-ground stations remain largely unstaffed, monitored by cameras and managed remotely.</p>

<p>Every station has step-free access. This was revolutionary in 1987, when disabled access was rarely considered in railway design. The Docklands Light Railway was among the first major British railway projects to make accessibility a core design principle rather than an afterthought. Level boarding from platform to train, lifts at every station, and consistent design throughout the network made it genuinely usable for wheelchair users, people with pushchairs, and anyone who struggled with stairs.</p>

<p>Passenger numbers have grown steadily as the network has expanded and the Docklands have filled with residents and workers. In the 2024/25 financial year, the railway carried nearly 98 million passenger journeys—approaching the kind of ridership figures that would have justified that full Jubilee line extension the Thatcher government rejected forty-five years earlier.</p>

<h2>The Franchise Model</h2>

<p>The railway is owned by Transport for London, the authority responsible for most public transport in the capital. But it's operated and maintained by a private company: KeolisAmey Docklands, a joint venture between the French transport company Keolis and the British infrastructure firm Amey.</p>

<p>This franchise model has been used for British railways since privatisation in the 1990s, with mixed results elsewhere on the network. For the Docklands Light Railway, it has worked reasonably well. The automated operation reduces the complexity of running the service—there are no drivers to train or manage—and the relatively self-contained network makes oversight simpler than on the sprawling mainline system.</p>

<h2>What Comes Next</h2>

<p>The railway continues to evolve. An extension to Thamesmead, a large housing development east of Woolwich, is currently being proposed. The area has long been isolated, poorly served by public transport, and the Docklands Light Railway could transform its prospects just as it transformed Canary Wharf's.</p>

<p>There's something fitting about this ongoing expansion. The Docklands Light Railway was born from dereliction, built to serve an area that had been abandoned by the industries that created it. Now it serves as a model for how urban railways can adapt and grow—automated, accessible, and always reaching for new destinations.</p>

<h2>Lessons from a Driverless Train</h2>

<p>The Docklands Light Railway's success offers several insights that apply beyond London.</p>

<p>First, infrastructure can precede development. The 1981 London Transport report worried about building a railway through derelict warehouses with "poor traffic prospects." But the railway helped create the traffic. Canary Wharf might never have attracted major tenants without reliable transport links; the transport links might never have been justified by passenger numbers if the development hadn't proceeded. Someone had to move first. The railway did.</p>

<p>Second, constraints can drive innovation. The minimal budget forced engineers to reuse Victorian infrastructure and adopt automation before it was proven at scale. A more generous budget might have produced a conventional railway with conventional limitations. The cheap option turned out to be the pioneering option.</p>

<p>Third, accessibility should be designed in from the start. Retrofitting level boarding and lifts to existing stations is expensive and often compromised. Building them into every station from day one costs relatively little and creates a system that truly serves everyone.</p>

<p>And finally, sitting at the front of a driverless train never quite stops being strange. The tracks stretch out ahead, the computer makes its decisions, and you hurtle through a landscape that was derelict wasteland within living memory. The Docklands Light Railway is a monument to what happens when technology, investment, and a certain amount of optimism converge. It's also, still, a genuinely good way to get to work.</p>
