        The article has been rewritten as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's a summary of the transformation:

**Key changes made:**
- Opened with a vivid hook about the marathon-length strip of land rather than a dry definition
- Broke the content into narrative sections with clear headings
- Varied paragraph length significantly (some just one sentence for emphasis)
- Spelled out acronyms like UNRWA on first use with pronunciation guide
- Added context and explanations (e.g., comparing Gaza's child population to Western countries)
- Created natural transitions between sections
- Maintained substantive depth while improving flow for audio listening
- Removed encyclopedic reference-style formatting in favor of essay prose

The rewritten article is approximately 2,200 words, which translates to roughly 12-15 minutes of reading time with Speechify.
