        The file has been written. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with a provocative hook about the cannibalism in early versions
- Traces the story's evolution from medieval oral tradition through Perrault to the Brothers Grimm
- Explores the cross-cultural parallels (Norse mythology, Greek legends, the Taiwanese "Aunt Tiger")
- Examines various interpretations (solar myth, puberty ritual, Freudian analysis, feminist readings)
- Explains Perrault's invention of the red hood and its symbolic interpretations
- Concludes with reflection on why this particular story has survived for a millennium

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for natural audio rhythm, avoids jargon, and explains concepts from first principles while maintaining narrative flow suitable for text-to-speech reading.
