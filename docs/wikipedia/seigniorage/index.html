        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on seigniorage. The article transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's the HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seigniorage">Wikipedia: Seigniorage</a></p>

<p>In 2008, the government of Zimbabwe funded over half its operations by simply printing money. The result was predictable: hyperinflation that saw prices double every forty-six days. By July of that year, the annual inflation rate had hit twenty-four thousand percent. It was a catastrophic example of a practice that every government engages in, though usually with far more restraint: earning profit from the very act of creating money.</p>

<p>This profit has a name. It's called seigniorage.</p>

<p>The word comes from Old French, meaning "the right of the lord to mint money." Medieval lords didn't just have the authority to stamp coins—they had the exclusive privilege to profit from doing so. When a merchant brought silver to the royal mint, the lord would keep a portion for himself. The coins that came out contained slightly less precious metal than the raw material that went in. The difference was seigniorage.</p>

<p>Today, the concept has evolved far beyond medieval coin-clipping, but the basic principle remains the same: governments make money by making money.</p>

<h2>The Simple Math of Profit</h2>

<p>At its most basic, seigniorage is the gap between what money costs to produce and what it's worth when spent. Consider a quarter. The United States Mint spends about five cents to manufacture each one. But that quarter buys twenty-five cents worth of goods and services. The difference—roughly twenty cents—flows to the government as pure profit.</p>

<p>This math gets particularly interesting when people collect coins instead of spending them.</p>

<p>When the United States launched its 50 State Quarters program in 1999, the government was betting on American nostalgia. They released a new quarter design for each state, one every few months, creating a nationwide collecting craze. Millions of Americans filled cardboard maps with quarters, tucking them away in drawers and closets.</p>

<p>From the government's perspective, this was spectacular. Every quarter that went into a collection instead of a cash register was profit the government never had to give back. A complete set—covering all fifty states, the five inhabited U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia—holds fourteen dollars in quarters. The mint spent about two dollars and eighty cents to produce them. When a collector removes that set from circulation permanently, the Treasury pockets eleven dollars and twenty cents.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department estimates it earned approximately six point three billion dollars in seigniorage from the State Quarters program alone.</p>

<h2>Paper Money and the Interest Game</h2>

<p>Coins are straightforward. Paper money is more subtle.</p>

<p>When central banks issue banknotes, the seigniorage doesn't come from the manufacturing cost—though printing money is indeed cheap, perhaps a few cents per bill regardless of denomination. Instead, the profit comes from interest.</p>

<p>Here's how it works. When a central bank like the Federal Reserve creates new money, it typically does so by purchasing government bonds. The bank essentially trades freshly printed dollars for Treasury securities that pay interest. The public gets new currency; the central bank gets interest-bearing assets. That interest income, minus the cost of printing and distributing the cash, constitutes seigniorage.</p>

<p>Think of it as an interest-free loan from the public to the government. When you hold a twenty-dollar bill in your wallet, you're extending credit to the Federal Reserve without receiving any interest. The Fed, meanwhile, holds bonds that pay interest every year. That interest is profit.</p>

<p>When currency eventually wears out—bills get tattered, coins get corroded—the issuer buys it back at face value. The books balance. But all those years of interest payments in between? That's the seigniorage.</p>

<h2>Gold, Paper, and the Loss of Value</h2>

<p>To understand how seigniorage works in modern fiat currency systems—where money isn't backed by gold or silver—consider a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Imagine you hold one ounce of gold. You take it to a government that still uses a gold standard and exchange it for a gold certificate, a piece of paper promising to return one ounce of gold on demand. You keep that certificate for a year, then redeem it. You walk out with exactly one ounce of gold. No seigniorage occurred because nothing changed—the government was merely holding your gold for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Now imagine a different scenario. You exchange your gold ounce for paper currency at the market rate—say, two thousand dollars. You hold those dollars for a year. When you try to buy gold again, you discover that gold now costs twenty-two hundred dollars per ounce. Your two thousand dollars buys you only about ninety percent of an ounce.</p>

<p>Where did the other ten percent go? Seigniorage. The government effectively captured value from you by issuing currency that lost purchasing power while you held it.</p>

<p>The opposite can happen too. If your currency gains purchasing power—if deflation occurs—you'd end up with more gold than you started with. Economists call this demurrage, the cost to the issuer when currency appreciates. But in the modern world, inflation is far more common than deflation, which means seigniorage typically flows toward governments, not away from them.</p>

<h2>The International Dollar Game</h2>

<p>Seigniorage becomes truly lucrative when your currency circulates outside your borders.</p>

<p>American dollars are everywhere. Taxi drivers in Moscow, street vendors in Lagos, and merchants in Buenos Aires all accept them. At the end of 2008, eight hundred twenty-four billion dollars in U.S. currency was circulating among the public, and roughly seventy-six percent of it was in hundred-dollar bills. That works out to about twenty hundred-dollar bills for every American citizen.</p>

<p>Obviously, not every American is walking around with two thousand dollars in cash. Much of this money is overseas.</p>

<p>Estimates vary dramatically. Some economists believe forty percent of U.S. currency is held abroad. Others put the figure as high as sixty-seven percent. A New York Federal Reserve publication suggested about five hundred eighty billion dollars—sixty-five percent of all banknotes—circulate outside the country. The Federal Reserve's own Flow of Funds statistics painted a different picture, indicating only about three hundred thirteen billion dollars, or thirty-seven percent, was held abroad as of early 2009.</p>

<p>Regardless of the exact figure, the economic implications are profound. When a foreigner acquires a hundred-dollar bill, they've given the United States something valuable—goods, services, labor—in exchange for a piece of paper that cost a few cents to print. If that bill never returns to America, which many never do, the United States has received something for essentially nothing.</p>

<p>One economist calculated that since 1964, cumulative seigniorage earnings from currency held by foreigners have totaled between one hundred sixty-seven and one hundred eighty-five billion dollars. Recent decades have seen annual seigniorage revenues from foreign holdings averaging six to seven billion dollars per year.</p>

<p>This is sometimes called "exorbitant privilege"—a term coined by a French finance minister in the 1960s who resented that America could pay for imports simply by printing money that the rest of the world was eager to hold.</p>

<h2>The Competition: Big Bills for Big Business</h2>

<p>The hundred-dollar bill has competition. The five-hundred-euro note, introduced when the European Union launched its common currency, offers certain practical advantages for those who need to move large amounts of cash.</p>

<p>One million dollars in hundred-dollar bills weighs about twenty-two pounds and requires a briefcase to transport. The same value in five-hundred-euro notes weighs less than three pounds and can be dispersed through clothing and luggage without triggering metal detectors or attracting suspicion.</p>

<p>This convenience has attracted a particular clientele. Law enforcement officials have noted that in illegal operations—drug trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion—the physical logistics of moving cash can be more challenging than moving the contraband itself. Cocaine is lighter per dollar of value than currency. The ease of transporting five-hundred-euro notes has made them popular among Latin American drug cartels, who need to move profits back from consumer markets in North America and Europe.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank discontinued the five-hundred-euro note in 2019, citing concerns about its use in criminal activity. Existing notes remain legal tender, but new ones are no longer printed.</p>

<p>Switzerland still issues its one-thousand-franc note, worth slightly over a thousand dollars. Remarkably, the number of these notes in circulation exceeds three times Switzerland's entire population. Compare this to Britain, where the number of fifty-pound notes—their highest denomination—is slightly less than three times the population, despite the fifty-pound note being worth only about one-twelfth as much as the Swiss thousand-franc.</p>

<p>The British have historical reasons for their caution about large-denomination notes. During World War Two, Nazi Germany launched Operation Bernhard, a counterfeiting scheme that flooded Britain with fake five, ten, twenty, and fifty-pound notes. The forgeries were so sophisticated that the Bank of England withdrew all notes larger than five pounds from circulation. They didn't reintroduce the ten-pound note until the early 1960s, the twenty in 1970, and the fifty not until 1981—thirty-six years after the war ended.</p>

<h2>The Dark Side: When Governments Get Greedy</h2>

<p>Seigniorage is seductive. For a government facing budget pressures, the temptation to print money rather than raise taxes or cut spending can be overwhelming.</p>

<p>The problem is that seigniorage is a hidden tax. When a government creates too much money, it dilutes the purchasing power of all existing money. Everyone who holds cash or has savings in that currency sees their wealth erode. Economists call this the "inflation tax," and it falls hardest on the poor and elderly—people who tend to keep their savings in cash rather than assets that rise with inflation.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe's collapse in 2008 stands as a warning. When a government funds half its operations through seigniorage, it's not really funding anything—it's destroying its own currency. The government prints money, prices rise, the government needs to print more money to pay for the same things, prices rise further. The spiral accelerates until money becomes worthless.</p>

<p>At the height of Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, the government issued a one-hundred-trillion-dollar note. It wasn't worth enough to buy a loaf of bread.</p>

<h2>The Allure of Collecting</h2>

<p>Occasionally, governments exploit seigniorage through collectible currency. Central banks issue limited quantities of unusual denominations—say, a fifty-dollar bill commemorating a national anniversary—knowing that collectors will remove them from circulation permanently.</p>

<p>The potential profits from such schemes are limited. Unusual denominations are hard to spend, which makes them less useful as money and therefore less attractive to most people. And while millions collect coins, far fewer collect high-value banknotes. A collector's penny collection costs the government almost nothing to produce. A collector's hundred-dollar bills tie up significant face value that the government must eventually be prepared to redeem.</p>

<p>Still, commemorative coins remain popular. The United States Mint has issued dozens of commemorative series, from presidential dollars to national parks quarters, each designed to encourage collecting—and each generating seigniorage when coins enter collections rather than cash registers.</p>

<h2>The Honest Tax</h2>

<p>Is seigniorage legitimate? The question has occupied economists and philosophers for centuries.</p>

<p>In one sense, it's unavoidable. Someone has to produce money, and production has costs. Even in a world of pure gold coins, those coins must be minted, weighed, verified, and protected from counterfeiting. The government provides these services, and seigniorage covers the cost—plus, usually, a profit.</p>

<p>In another sense, seigniorage is taxation without explicit legislation. When the Federal Reserve expands the money supply, it doesn't ask Congress for permission to levy the resulting inflation tax on dollar holders. The transfer of wealth happens automatically, invisibly, and disproportionately affects those least equipped to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Modern central banks try to thread this needle by maintaining price stability—keeping inflation low enough that seigniorage remains a modest revenue source rather than a wealth-destroying mechanism. The Federal Reserve targets about two percent annual inflation, which generates seigniorage while preserving confidence in the dollar.</p>

<p>Other countries have tried different approaches. Ecuador and El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as their official currency, surrendering seigniorage entirely to the United States in exchange for monetary stability. Panama has used the dollar since 1904 and has never experienced the hyperinflation that has plagued its neighbors.</p>

<p>The European Union pools seigniorage among member states according to a complex formula, recognizing that the benefits of a shared currency should be shared as well.</p>

<h2>A Lord's Privilege in Modern Form</h2>

<p>Seigniorage remains what it was in medieval times: the profit from controlling money. The mechanisms have changed—from clipping silver coins to earning interest on bond portfolios—but the principle endures. Whoever controls the money supply controls a stream of revenue that requires no tax collectors, no enforcement, no legislation.</p>

<p>For the Royal Canadian Mint, this meant ninety-three million dollars in 2006. For the U.S. government, it meant about twenty-five billion dollars in 2000. For Zimbabwe, it meant national catastrophe.</p>

<p>The next time you pocket your change or fold a bill into your wallet, consider: you're participating in one of the oldest financial relationships in human civilization. You've accepted the lord's coin. And somewhere, in ways you'll never see directly, the lord is collecting his due.</p>

The rewrite opens with the dramatic Zimbabwe hyperinflation example rather than a dry definition, varies sentence and paragraph lengths for better audio listening, spells out numbers for Speechify compatibility, and builds understanding from first principles. It also adds interesting connections like the "exorbitant privilege" concept and Operation Bernhard, which weren't fully explained in the original.
