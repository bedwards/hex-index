<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert">Wikipedia: Dilbert</a></p>

<p>In the mid-1990s, something strange happened in American offices. Employees started taping comic strips to their cubicle walls, filing cabinets, and break room bulletin boards. The strips showed a bespectacled engineer with an inexplicably upward-curving tie, surrounded by incompetent managers, cynical coworkers, and absurd corporate policies. Workers recognized their own lives in these panels. They laughed because it hurt.</p>

<p>The comic was Dilbert, and it became the most successful newspaper comic strip about white-collar work ever created.</p>

<h2>The Accidental Satirist</h2>

<p>Scott Adams launched Dilbert on April 16, 1989, through United Feature Syndicate. The early strips bore little resemblance to what the comic would become. They focused on Dilbert at home with his megalomaniacal pet dog Dogbert, featuring bizarre inventions and domestic misadventures. It was clever enough, but nothing revolutionary.</p>

<p>Then Adams made a crucial pivot. He moved the action from Dilbert's living room to his office.</p>

<p>"That's when the strip really started to take off," Adams later explained. The new setting was Silicon Valley, and suddenly millions of office workers saw their daily frustrations rendered in four panels. The incompetent boss who speaks only in buzzwords. The colleague who has elevated doing nothing into an art form. The talented employee whose contributions go unrecognized because she's a woman. The eager intern whose idealism gets crushed by corporate reality.</p>

<p>These weren't just characters. They were archetypes that workers encountered every single day.</p>

<h2>A Kafkaesque Corporate World</h2>

<p>Franz Kafka, the early twentieth-century writer, created nightmarish visions of bureaucracy as an incomprehensible, dehumanizing force. His protagonists struggle against systems that seem designed specifically to frustrate and diminish them. Dilbert operates in the same territory, but plays it for laughs rather than existential dread.</p>

<p>The world of Dilbert is one where bureaucracy exists for its own sake. Office politics make actual productivity impossible. Hard work goes unrewarded while busy work receives praise. Employees make absurd decisions not because they're stupid, but because mismanagement has created an environment where absurdity is the only rational response.</p>

<p>This resonated because it felt true. Surveys consistently show that most employees believe their organizations are poorly managed. Dilbert gave them permission to laugh at what might otherwise drive them to despair.</p>

<h2>The Cast of Characters</h2>

<p>At the center stands Dilbert himself, a skilled engineer who is terrible at everything else in life. His social skills are minimal. His romantic life is nonexistent. For twenty-five years, he wore a white dress shirt, black trousers, and a red-and-black striped tie that curved upward in defiance of gravity. Adams never explained the tie. In October 2014, Dilbert switched to a red polo shirt with a lanyard, reflecting the casual dress codes that had overtaken even conservative workplaces.</p>

<p>The Pointy-Haired Boss has no name. Adams deliberately left him unnamed so that every reader could imagine their own boss in his place. His defining physical feature, those two points of hair that recall devil horns, wasn't part of his original design. Early strips showed him as a stereotypical balding middle manager with jowls. The signature look evolved over time, along with his brother, a demon named Phil who serves as the Prince of Insufficient Light and Supreme Ruler of Heck. Phil's job is to punish minor sins, the ones not quite bad enough for Hell. He "darns people to Heck" for using cell phones in bathrooms or stealing office supplies.</p>

<p>The Boss embodies managerial incompetence in its purest form. He doesn't understand technical issues but masks this with buzzwords he also doesn't understand. He treats employees with alternating enthusiasm and neglect, using them for his own ends without considering consequences. Adams described him as "not sadistic, just uncaring." His intelligence varies wildly from strip to strip, ranging from near-vegetative to surprisingly perceptive, depending on what the joke requires. But his complete lack of business ethics remains perfectly consistent.</p>

<p>Wally represents something different: the employee who has given up entirely. Originally, he was a worker trying to get fired to collect a large severance package. Adams based him on a real coworker at Pacific Bell who had discovered that the company was offering generous buyouts to its worst employees. This man, whom Adams called "one of the more brilliant people I've met," responded by working hard at being incompetent. He wanted to qualify for the program.</p>

<p>This inspired Wally's fundamental character: brilliant but lazy, utterly without ethics, always carrying a cup of coffee that he sips calmly even during office-shaking crises. While Dilbert rages against corporate dysfunction, Wally has learned to use that dysfunction as cover for his laziness. He's achieved a kind of enlightenment, though not the sort that any religion would recognize.</p>

<p>Alice provides the female perspective. She's one of the most competent engineers in the company and among the highest paid, yet she never receives proper recognition. She believes this is because she's female, and the strip generally supports her interpretation. Unlike Dilbert's passive frustration or Wally's detached cynicism, Alice responds with fury. Her "Fist of Death" is deployed liberally, even against the Pointy-Haired Boss. Adams based her on a real coworker named Anita, who shared Alice's "pink suit, fluffy hair, technical proficiency, coffee obsession, and take-no-crap attitude."</p>

<p>Asok the intern represents hope, which means he exists primarily to have that hope crushed. He graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology, one of the most competitive engineering programs in the world. He scored a perfect 1600 on the SAT. His IQ is 240. He may be the smartest person in the entire company.</p>

<p>None of this matters.</p>

<p>The Boss sends him on odd jobs. His ideas get ignored in meetings. His cultural beliefs get trampled by coworkers who don't even notice they're doing it. Slowly, through jarring revelations at the lunch table with Wally and Dilbert, Asok learns the true nature of corporate life. Sometimes he even takes advice from Wally on the arts of laziness. In a 2014 strip, Adams revealed that Asok is gay, a detail that never affects any storylines. Adams added it to commemorate a decision by the Indian Supreme Court upholding an anti-gay law from the British colonial era, a decision that would eventually be overturned in 2018.</p>

<p>Dogbert, Dilbert's pet dog, is actually the smartest character in the entire strip. He's also the most evil. His goal is world conquest, and he once actually achieved it, only to quit because he found peace boring. He frequently takes high-ranking consultant jobs where he abuses his power and fools management, though as the strip notes, fooling management at Dilbert's company requires minimal effort. Despite his cynical exterior, Dogbert occasionally rescues his master from tight situations.</p>

<p>Catbert, the evil director of human resources, started as a one-time character but resonated so strongly with readers that Adams brought him back permanently. In the strip's internal logic, Dogbert hired Catbert specifically because he wanted an HR director who appeared cute while secretly downsizing employees. This is, of course, exactly how many workers perceive their own HR departments.</p>

<h2>Elbonia and the American Worldview</h2>

<p>When Dilbert needs a foreign country, Adams sends the characters to Elbonia. It's located somewhere in the former Eastern Bloc. A 1990 strip identified it as a "tiny East European country." It has "abandoned Communism" and remains extremely poor, what Adams calls a "fourth-world country." Its national bird is the Frisbee.</p>

<p>The entire country is covered in mud. Everyone wears the same clothing and hats. All men and women have full beards. Technology is minimal.</p>

<p>Adams has been explicit about what Elbonia represents. "People think I have some specific country in mind when I write about Elbonia, but I don't," he explained. "It represents the view that Americans have of any country that doesn't have cable television. We think they all wear fur hats and wallow around waist-deep in mud."</p>

<p>This is satire operating on two levels. It mocks underdeveloped countries, yes, but it also mocks American ignorance about the rest of the world. The joke is as much about Americans who can't distinguish between any foreign nations as it is about those nations themselves.</p>

<h2>Peak Dilbert</h2>

<p>By 2013, Dilbert appeared daily in two thousand newspapers across sixty-five countries, translated into twenty-five languages. Adams had won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award in 1997, the highest honor in American cartooning. The strip spawned dozens of books, with titles like The Dilbert Future and The Joy of Work becoming bestsellers. There was an animated television series, a video game, and hundreds of pieces of merchandise.</p>

<p>More importantly, Dilbert had entered the cultural vocabulary. "Pointy-haired boss" became shorthand for incompetent management. The strip provided a shared language for workers to discuss their frustrations. When someone said "that's very Dilbert," everyone knew exactly what they meant.</p>

<h2>The Unraveling</h2>

<p>The relationship between Dilbert and its audience began fraying in the 2020s. In September 2022, Lee Enterprises dropped the strip from seventy-seven newspapers when restructuring their comics pages. Adams said he'd received complaints about strips mocking Environmental, Social, and Governance investing, known as ESG, a framework that encourages companies to consider their environmental and social impact alongside financial returns. He wasn't sure if that was why Lee dropped him.</p>

<p>The San Francisco Chronicle, owned by Hearst Media, dropped Dilbert the following month. They cited strips that joked about slavery reparations being claimed by underperforming office workers.</p>

<p>In 2022, Adams introduced Dave, the strip's first Black character. Dave identifies as white despite being Black, which messes up the company's diversity scores. It's unclear whether Dave is serious or deliberately trolling. At least one newspaper chain refused to run strips featuring him.</p>

<p>Then came February 2023.</p>

<p>On February 22, Adams published a YouTube video responding to a Rasmussen Reports poll. The poll had asked respondents whether they agreed with the statement "It's okay to be White." This phrase has a complicated history. It originated on internet message boards specifically designed to provoke controversy. White supremacist groups adopted it. At the same time, many people who hear the phrase without knowing this context simply agree with it at face value, because of course it's okay to be any race.</p>

<p>The poll found that 53% of African Americans agreed with the statement, 26% disagreed, and 21% said they were not sure. Adams focused on those who disagreed or were uncertain. In the video, he characterized Black Americans who didn't agree with the statement as a "hate group" and advised white people to "get the hell away from black people."</p>

<p>The response was swift and devastating. Hundreds of newspapers dropped the strip within days. Gannett, which owns USA Today and dozens of regional papers including the Detroit Free Press, The Indianapolis Star, The Cincinnati Enquirer, and The Arizona Republic, cut ties immediately. The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and The Plain Dealer all ceased syndication and published editorials denouncing Adams. The Los Angeles Times noted that they had already removed four Dilbert cartoons in the previous nine months for not meeting their standards.</p>

<p>Most significantly, Andrews McMeel Syndication, which had distributed the strip since 2011, severed the relationship entirely. This meant Dilbert vanished from GoComics, the major digital platform for newspaper comics.</p>

<p>Major news organizations including The Economist and Reuters described the video as containing "racist comments" and being a "racist rant." Adams stated that he disavows racism.</p>

<h2>Dilbert Reborn and the End</h2>

<p>On March 16, 2023, Adams relaunched the strip as a webcomic on Locals, a subscription platform often used by creators who have been removed from mainstream channels. He called it Dilbert Reborn and promised it would be "spicier than the original."</p>

<p>The strip that had spent three decades in thousands of newspapers was now available only to paying subscribers on an alternative platform. The audience that had once numbered in the tens of millions shrank to a devoted core.</p>

<p>Scott Adams died in January 2026 from prostate cancer. He was sixty-eight years old.</p>

<h2>The Lasting Questions</h2>

<p>Dilbert's legacy is now permanently complicated. For more than three decades, it gave voice to the frustrations of office workers everywhere. It created characters that became cultural touchstones. It made people laugh at the absurdity of corporate life in a way that made that absurdity more bearable.</p>

<p>At the same time, its creator's final years cast a shadow over everything that came before. Can you separate the art from the artist? Should you? These questions have no easy answers, and they're ones that each former Dilbert reader must answer for themselves.</p>

<p>What's undeniable is that Dilbert captured something real about American work life. The pointy-haired bosses still exist. The meetings that accomplish nothing continue. The talented employees still go unrecognized while office politicians thrive. The strip may be gone from mainstream newspapers, but the world it depicted remains.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's the most Dilbert-like ending possible. The satirist is gone, but the things he satirized endure unchanged.</p>
