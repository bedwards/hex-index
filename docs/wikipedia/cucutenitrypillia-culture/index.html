<h2>The Forgotten Cities Before Cities</h2>

<p>Six thousand years ago, while Mesopotamia was still a scattering of villages, the largest settlements in the world sat on the rolling plains between the Carpathian Mountains and the Dnieper River. Some of these settlements housed as many as forty-six thousand people. They had multi-story buildings, sophisticated kilns, and what may have been the world's first wheeled vehicles.</p>

<p>Then, every sixty to eighty years, the inhabitants burned everything to the ground.</p>

<p>This is the story of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, a civilization that flourished for over two thousand years across what is now Moldova, western Ukraine, and northeastern Romania. At its peak, it may have reached a million people. It left behind some of the most beautiful pottery ever created, tantalizing evidence of wheeled transport predating anything in the ancient Near East, and a mystery that archaeologists still argue about: why did these people systematically destroy their own towns?</p>

<h2>A Discovery in Road Gravel</h2>

<p>The story of how we learned about this culture begins, as many archaeological discoveries do, with accident and curiosity.</p>

<p>In 1884, a Romanian scholar named Teodor Burada noticed something odd about the gravel being used to maintain a road near the city of Iași. Mixed in with the stones were fragments of decorated pottery and small clay figurines. Burada traced the gravel to a quarry near the village of Cucuteni, and the following spring, he and several colleagues began excavating. What they found would eventually be presented at two international conferences in Paris in 1889, introducing the scholarly world to a previously unknown civilization.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, almost simultaneously, a Czech-born archaeologist named Vincenc Chvojka was making similar discoveries in Kyiv, Ukraine. In a village called Trypillia, artifacts matching those from Romania emerged from the earth. This created a naming problem that persists to this day. Romanians call it the Cucuteni culture. Ukrainians call it Trypillia. In English, we've settled on the rather awkward compromise of "Cucuteni–Trypillia," acknowledging that these are the same people seen from different national perspectives.</p>

<p>Today, archaeologists have identified roughly three thousand sites belonging to this culture, scattered across an area of three hundred fifty thousand square kilometers, about the size of Germany.</p>

<h2>When Europe Was Warm</h2>

<p>To understand why this culture flourished where it did, you need to understand the climate of the time. The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture existed during what scientists call the Atlantic and Subboreal climatic periods, a window from roughly 5050 to 2950 before the common era when Europe was warmer and wetter than at any time since the last Ice Age.</p>

<p>This made the region between the Carpathians and the Dnieper exceptionally fertile. The culture's heartland lay along the middle and upper Dniester River, in an area called the Podolian Upland. From there, it spread northeast toward the Dnieper, southeast toward the Black Sea, and west into the Carpathian foothills. Settlements clustered along river valleys, spaced just three to four kilometers apart, close enough for mutual support but far enough for each community to have its own agricultural land.</p>

<p>The inhabitants grew wheat, rye, and peas. They kept cattle as their primary livestock, with pigs, sheep, and goats playing supporting roles. They fished the rivers and hunted game in the forests. And they developed agricultural techniques sophisticated enough to sustain large populations, practices that would shape the landscape for millennia. The cultural steppe of the region today, the particular mix of grassland and forest that characterizes modern Ukraine and Moldova, owes something to how these Neolithic farmers worked the land.</p>

<h2>The Mega-Sites</h2>

<p>Most Cucuteni–Trypillia settlements were modest affairs, small villages of a few dozen structures. But during the culture's middle period, roughly 4100 to 3500 before the common era, something remarkable happened. Some settlements grew to unprecedented size.</p>

<p>These are the mega-sites, and they have forced archaeologists to reconsider what was possible in Neolithic Europe.</p>

<p>The largest contained up to three thousand structures. Population estimates vary widely, from twenty thousand to forty-six thousand inhabitants, but even the lower figure would make these among the largest human settlements anywhere in the world at that time. They predate the rise of Sumerian cities by centuries. They were building what some scholars argue were genuine urban centers while the future sites of Ur and Uruk were still small farming villages.</p>

<p>Whether we should call these true "cities" is debated. They lacked some features we associate with urban life: writing, monumental public architecture, clear evidence of centralized government. But they had others: dense population, specialized craft production, and a scale of social organization that must have required sophisticated coordination.</p>

<p>One intriguing theory suggests that these communities were initially egalitarian, with decision-making shared broadly among inhabitants. Some scholars argue that the eventual rise of inequality, perhaps driven by control over copper resources or the best agricultural land, contributed to the culture's eventual decline. Hierarchy, in this view, was not a sign of social advancement but a cancer that weakened the cooperative bonds holding these large communities together.</p>

<h2>The Potters' Revolution</h2>

<p>If you could bring back one artifact from the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, you would probably choose their pottery. It is stunning.</p>

<p>The ceramic tradition evolved over the culture's two-thousand-year existence. Early pottery was relatively plain, fired in kilns to a smoky grey color, decorated with raised and sunken relief patterns. But around 4600 before the common era, something changed. Potters began painting their wares before firing, using a technique borrowed from the neighboring Gumelnița–Karanovo culture to the south. White paint on dark clay gave way to elaborate designs in black, white, and red on yellow or orange backgrounds.</p>

<p>The signature motif was the spiral. Cucuteni–Trypillia potters painted spirals that flowed around vessel surfaces in hypnotic patterns, interconnected and endless. Some scholars see cosmic symbolism in these designs, representations of cyclical time or eternal recurrence. Others point out that spirals are simply pleasing to the eye and flow naturally from a rotating work surface.</p>

<p>Which brings us to a genuinely revolutionary claim: the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture may have invented the potter's wheel.</p>

<p>The remains of what appear to be potter's wheels from the middle of the fifth millennium before the common era have been found at Cucuteni–Trypillia sites. If correctly dated and interpreted, these predate any evidence of similar wheels in Mesopotamia by several hundred years. The wheel, that quintessential symbol of civilization's march, may have first turned not in the ancient Near East but on the plains of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Even more provocatively, the culture has produced miniature wheeled models, tiny clay carts and wagons, that predate any evidence of actual wheeled vehicles in Mesopotamia. Some archaeologists have argued that wheeled transport itself was invented here and spread outward to the rest of the world. This remains controversial. Others suggest the models might represent sledges, or be purely symbolic objects with no real-world referent. But the possibility is tantalizing: that the wheel, in both its potter's and transport forms, rolled first in Neolithic Europe.</p>

<h2>The House Burners</h2>

<p>Now we come to the mystery.</p>

<p>Cucuteni–Trypillia settlements show a peculiar pattern. They were occupied for roughly sixty to eighty years, then deliberately burned. The inhabitants would then rebuild, sometimes directly on top of the ashes, preserving the shape and orientation of the older structures. At one site called Poduri in Romania, archaeologists have found thirteen separate habitation levels stacked on top of each other, each representing a cycle of building, burning, and rebuilding.</p>

<p>Why would people systematically destroy their own homes?</p>

<p>Several theories compete for acceptance. One practical suggestion is that the buildings, constructed of wattle and daub (woven branches covered in clay) with wooden structural elements, accumulated pests and rot over decades. Burning was the most effective way to sanitize the site before rebuilding. The fire would kill insects, rodents, and parasites, and the ash would enrich the soil.</p>

<p>A more symbolic interpretation sees the burnings as ritual acts, perhaps connected to beliefs about the life cycle of buildings. In many traditional cultures, houses are conceived as having their own life spans, their own births and deaths. The burning might have been a kind of funeral rite for the dwelling, releasing its spirit or preventing it from becoming dangerous in its old age. The fact that rebuilding often followed the same footprint, the same orientation, suggests continuity through transformation rather than abandonment.</p>

<p>Another theory connects the practice to social organization. If property was held communally, periodic destruction and rebuilding would prevent the accumulation of wealth disparities. You cannot inherit a larger or better-positioned house if all houses are regularly burned. Each generation starts fresh, quite literally, from the ashes.</p>

<p>We may never know for certain. The Cucuteni–Trypillia people left no writing to explain their intentions. We have only the archaeological evidence: layer upon layer of burned clay, rebuilt and burned again, for two thousand years.</p>

<h2>Gods and Goddesses</h2>

<p>Among the most evocative artifacts from Cucuteni–Trypillia sites are the clay figurines, particularly the female figures with exaggerated hips and breasts, often seated or standing with arms raised.</p>

<p>These figurines captured the imagination of the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas, who saw in them evidence of a goddess-worshipping, peaceful, egalitarian "Old Europe" that was later destroyed by patriarchal, warlike Indo-European invaders from the steppes. Her vision of a matriarchal golden age, later popularized by Joseph Campbell and embraced by some twentieth-century feminists, remains influential but controversial.</p>

<p>Gimbutas herself was careful to distinguish between "matriarchal" (ruled by women) and "matristic" (centered on feminine principles), though this nuance often gets lost in popular accounts. The archaeological evidence from Cucuteni–Trypillia sites is ambiguous. Women certainly played important roles in community life. The production of textiles and pottery, both central to the culture's economy and identity, appears to have been primarily women's work. But whether this translated into political power or social dominance is impossible to determine from figurines alone.</p>

<p>What we can say is that female imagery was important to these people. Male figurines exist but are far less common. Animals were also represented, as were miniature houses, perhaps used in rituals or as teaching tools for children. The abundance of these objects suggests a rich symbolic life, a world of meaning and belief that we can glimpse but not fully enter.</p>

<h2>Copper and Trade</h2>

<p>The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture straddled the transition from the Neolithic (New Stone Age) to the Chalcolithic (Copper-Stone Age). Its people used stone tools throughout their history, but they also worked copper with increasing sophistication.</p>

<p>A remarkable hoard discovered in the village of Cărbuna in Moldova contained hundreds of copper objects: bracelets, rings, hooks, beads. Dating to the early fifth millennium before the common era, this cache suggests that copper already held special value, probably as jewelry and markers of status rather than for practical tools. Later, copper axes and other utilitarian objects appear, made from ore mined in Volyn, Ukraine, and along the Dnieper River.</p>

<p>Some historians see this metallurgical activity as evidence that social stratification was already developing in early Cucuteni–Trypillia society. Copper required specialized knowledge to extract, smelt, and work. Those who controlled copper production and trade may have accumulated wealth and influence, undermining the egalitarian social structures that some scholars believe characterized the culture's early phases. Others dispute this interpretation, arguing that the evidence for pronounced hierarchy remains thin.</p>

<p>Trade connections certainly existed. The culture interacted with neighboring groups: the Linear Pottery culture to the north, the Boian culture to the south, the Gumelnița–Karanovo culture in the Balkans. Techniques, designs, and probably marriage partners moved between these communities. Along the Black Sea coast, Cucuteni–Trypillia people came into contact with entirely different cultural traditions, creating frontier zones where ideas and goods exchanged hands.</p>

<h2>The Horse Question</h2>

<p>One of the most contested questions about the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture involves horses. Horse bones have been found at some settlements, but archaeologists disagree about whether these were wild horses hunted for food or domesticated animals used for transport or herding.</p>

<p>The domestication of the horse transformed human history, enabling the rapid movement of people, goods, and ideas across the Eurasian steppes. If the Cucuteni–Trypillia people had domesticated horses, it would suggest a level of technological sophistication and social complexity even greater than usually attributed to them. But the evidence remains ambiguous. Horse bones alone cannot tell us whether the animal was tamed or wild.</p>

<p>What is clear is that horses became more important in the culture's later phases, around 3500 to 2950 before the common era. This period also saw increasing contact with steppe cultures to the east, cultures that definitely used horses and would eventually spread the Indo-European languages across much of Europe and Asia. The relationship between these steppe peoples and the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture is central to understanding how this civilization ended.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>How the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture ended is a matter of ongoing debate, and the arguments carry contemporary resonance given the current war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>One influential theory, associated with Marija Gimbutas and her Kurgan hypothesis, holds that the culture was destroyed by force. According to this view, warlike pastoralists from the Pontic steppe, the ancestors of the Indo-European peoples, swept westward in waves, conquering and absorbing the peaceful farming communities of Old Europe. The mega-sites were abandoned, the sophisticated pottery traditions died out, and a new, more violent social order took hold.</p>

<p>This narrative of invasion and destruction has its critics. Some archaeologists argue that the evidence for violent conquest is thin, that the culture's decline was gradual rather than sudden, driven by environmental change, agricultural exhaustion, or internal social collapse rather than external attack. The burning of settlements, for instance, was a traditional practice, not necessarily evidence of enemy action.</p>

<p>Others take a middle position, suggesting that the steppe cultures and the Cucuteni–Trypillia people interacted in complex ways over centuries. There was probably some violence, but also trade, intermarriage, and cultural exchange. The "end" of Cucuteni–Trypillia culture may have been less an extinction event than a transformation, its people and practices absorbed into new configurations as the Bronze Age dawned.</p>

<p>By around 2950 before the common era, the distinctive Cucuteni–Trypillia material culture, the painted pottery, the clay figurines, the mega-sites, had disappeared. Whatever replaced it looked different, organized differently, lived differently. A chapter in human history had closed.</p>

<h2>What They Left Behind</h2>

<p>The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture matters not just as a historical curiosity but as a challenge to our assumptions about human development.</p>

<p>For a long time, the story of civilization was told as a progression from the ancient Near East outward: Mesopotamia invented cities, writing, the wheel, and these innovations spread to a grateful world. The Cucuteni–Trypillia evidence complicates this narrative. Here was a culture that built large, complex settlements centuries before Sumer, that may have developed wheeled transport independently, that sustained a population perhaps exceeding a million people for two thousand years, all without writing, without kings, possibly without the hierarchies we assume complex societies require.</p>

<p>This raises uncomfortable questions. Was writing actually necessary for social coordination at this scale? Were kings? Could egalitarian communities really have managed mega-sites of forty thousand people? If so, what does this mean for our assumptions about how human societies must be organized?</p>

<p>The culture also offers a meditation on impermanence. These people built elaborate homes, filled them with beautiful objects, lived in them for generations, then burned them to the ground and started over. They did this not once but repeatedly, for two millennia. Perhaps they understood something about attachment and renewal that our own civilization, so invested in permanence and accumulation, has forgotten.</p>

<p>Today, the lands of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture are again in the news, again contested. The region that nurtured this remarkable civilization, the fertile plains between the Carpathians and the Dnieper, remains what it has been for six thousand years: a crossroads where different peoples and cultures meet, mix, and sometimes clash. The Cucuteni–Trypillia people are long gone, their language lost, their beliefs only dimly glimpsed through clay and ash. But the land remembers. The land endures.</p>
