        I've written the Wikipedia article rewrite about artistic gymnastics. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The "pixie" era crisis of 1992, which immediately draws readers in
2. **Tells a narrative arc** - From ancient origins through the troubling child athlete era and back to today's healthier sport
3. **Explains apparatus in detail** - Breaking down each piece of equipment for readers unfamiliar with the sport
4. **Varies sentence and paragraph length** - Creating rhythm suitable for text-to-speech reading
5. **Spells out acronyms** - FIG (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique), etc.
6. **Avoids jargon** - Explains terms like "kinesthetic awareness" and "Code of Points" when introduced

The article is approximately 3,500 words, providing about 15-20 minutes of reading time. It connects to the Substack article about The Great British Bake Off through the broader theme of passionate fandom and spectator entertainment.

However, it appears I don't have permission to write to the docs/wikipedia/artistic-gymnastics/index.html path. You'll need to grant write access or create the directory first so I can save the file.
