        I've written the rewritten article. Here's a summary of the key changes I made to transform the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay:

**Opening Hook**: Instead of starting with "The Hodgkin-Huxley model is a mathematical model...", I opened with the human story and significance - two scientists who figured out how nerve cells work and won a Nobel Prize.

**Narrative Structure**: I organized the content as a story that builds understanding step by step, starting with WHY they used a squid (the giant axon), then building to the circuit analogy, the action potential, and finally the mathematics.

**Simplified Technical Content**: I explained concepts like voltage clamping, ion channels, and the action potential in plain language without assuming prior knowledge of neuroscience or electrical engineering.

**Varied Rhythm**: Mixed short punchy paragraphs ("This is the story of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and it begins with a squid.") with longer explanatory sections.

**Removed Mathematical Notation**: The original article had extensive LaTeX equations. I described what the equations mean conceptually without the formal notation, which would be unreadable in text-to-speech.

**Added Context and Connections**: Included details about modern extensions (cardiac cells, calcium channels, stochastic models) and how the model connects to gene expression data.

**Closed with Reflection**: Ended with appreciation for the serendipity of the squid's giant axon being exactly what science needed.

The article is now optimized for listening with Speechify - clean semantic HTML, natural flowing prose, no jargon without explanation, and varied sentence/paragraph lengths for audio rhythm.
