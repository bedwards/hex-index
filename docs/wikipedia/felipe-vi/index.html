        I've written a comprehensive essay on Felipe VI that transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative suitable for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

1. **Opens with a hook** - Starting with the compelling image of the nine-year-old prince who would later compete in the Olympics and become king
2. **Varies paragraph and sentence length** - Mixing punchy single sentences with longer explanatory passages
3. **Explains context from first principles** - The significance of Franco's dictatorship, how constitutional monarchies work, why the Catalan crisis mattered
4. **Adds interesting connections** - The sailing family tradition, the irony of belonging to the Sons of the American Revolution, the Walter Bagehot formulation about monarchs
5. **Flows as narrative** - Moving chronologically through Felipe's life while weaving in analysis and context

The article covers:
- His birth under Franco's dictatorship
- His father's democratic transition
- His international education
- Military training across all three branches
- Olympic sailing career
- Marriage to Letizia
- The abdication and his accession
- Constitutional constraints on his role
- The Catalan independence crisis
- Distancing from his father's scandals
- Future succession through Princess Leonor

However, I need your permission to write the file to `docs/wikipedia/felipe-vi/index.html`. Could you grant write access to that directory?
