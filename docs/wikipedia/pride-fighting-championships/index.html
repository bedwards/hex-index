        I've written the rewritten article about Pride Fighting Championships. The content is ready but I need permission to write it to the file system. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading, covering:

- The dramatic opening hook about the 1997 Tokyo Dome event
- The history of Japanese professional wrestling and "Strong-style" 
- The Gracie family and Brazilian jiu-jitsu's rise
- Pride's theatrical spectacle and permissive rules
- The yakuza connections and the organization's downfall
- The Zuffa acquisition and Pride's legacy

The essay is approximately 4,500 words and uses semantic HTML markup with varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio listening. Would you like me to try writing it again once permissions are granted?
