        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on "Perversion." The article:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The etymological journey of the word from religious apostasy (1660s) to sexual meaning (1896)

2. **Explores the philosophical tension** - Between subjective and objective views of what constitutes perversion

3. **Covers the word's multiple meanings** - Legal ("perverting justice"), economic ("perverse incentives"), and colloquial uses

4. **Presents Freud's revolutionary insights** - His argument that all humans are "innately perverse" and that childhood is "polymorphously perverse"

5. **Explains key psychoanalytic concepts** - The "well-organized tyranny" of desire, the defensive function of perversions, Fenichel's insights

6. **Addresses the gender gap** - Nearly a century of psychoanalytic silence on female perversion until Richards's 2003 paper

7. **Traces the post-sexual revolution debate** - The Panglossian view vs. the post-permissive critique from Lacan and object relations theorists

8. **Ends with the word's ongoing evolution** - How "paraphilia" replaced it clinically, but the word's boundary-marking function persists

The essay is optimized for Speechify with varied sentence and paragraph lengths, no jargon without explanation, and smooth narrative flow. It runs approximately 15 minutes of reading time.
