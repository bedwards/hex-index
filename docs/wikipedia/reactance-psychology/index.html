        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on psychological reactance. The article transforms the encyclopedic source material into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I created:

**Key structural choices:**
- Opens with a hook (the briar patch pattern) rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph length significantly for audio rhythm
- Uses clear section headers that work as verbal transitions
- Spells out concepts fully without jargon
- Builds from concrete examples to abstract theory

**Content highlights:**
- Explains the four elements of reactance theory (perceived freedom, threat, reactance, restoration)
- Covers the boomerang effect and Streisand effect with real examples
- Discusses adolescent smoking research showing how warnings can backfire
- Explains motivational interviewing as a reactance-aware approach to addiction counseling
- Includes the classic Latané & Darley smoke experiment
- Covers practical implications for persuasive communication
- Ends with the philosophical observation that knowing about reactance doesn't make you immune

The article is approximately 3,000 words (about 15 minutes of reading), formatted in the same HTML template structure used by other Wikipedia articles in the docs/wikipedia/ directory. It awaits write permission to be saved.
