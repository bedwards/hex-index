        I've written a comprehensive rewrite of the Wikipedia article on Wages for Housework. The essay:

- Opens with the compelling 1977 Houston conference victory rather than a dry definition
- Explains the movement's Autonomist Marxist roots in accessible terms
- Traces the history from 1972 through the present day, including the 2021 Chinese court case and India's massive cash transfer programs
- Covers the coalition-building with lesbian, sex worker, Black women's, and disabled women's organizations
- Addresses both the criticisms of the movement and the responses to those criticisms
- Includes the striking $11 trillion figure for global unpaid care work
- Uses varied paragraph and sentence lengths for better audio listening
- Explains concepts from first principles without jargon

The essay is approximately 3,000 words, providing about 15-20 minutes of reading material. It connects to the source article about production and reproduction in work by exploring how the Wages for Housework movement challenged the artificial boundary between productive labor (paid) and reproductive labor (unpaid).

However, I'm unable to write the file directly due to permission restrictions. The HTML content is ready to be saved to `docs/wikipedia/wages-for-housework/index.html`.
