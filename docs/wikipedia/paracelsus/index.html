        I've written a rewrite of the Paracelsus Wikipedia article. The article:

- Opens with the dramatic hook of Paracelsus burning Avicenna's Canon in Basel's public square
- Traces his life from his education under his physician father through his wandering years as an army surgeon
- Explains his revolutionary medical ideas including the dose-response principle that makes him the "father of toxicology"
- Connects to the Substack article's theme by discussing the bizarre European practice of consuming Egyptian mummies as medicine, which was prevalent during Paracelsus's era
- Maintains narrative flow while covering his religious beliefs, occult interests, and combative personality
- Varies sentence and paragraph length for text-to-speech readability
- Runs approximately 2,800 words (around 14 minutes reading time)

The article is ready to be saved once permissions are granted.
