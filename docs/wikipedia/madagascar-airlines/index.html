        I've written a rewritten Wikipedia article about Madagascar Airlines. The content transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging narrative essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.

Key features of the rewrite:

**Structure:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about the 1967 crash that killed Madagascar's Foreign Minister
- Organizes chronologically through seven sections: founding, independence, international expansion, political challenges, privatization failures, EU ban, and current state
- Closes with reflection on what the airline's struggles reveal about African aviation

**Style for audio listening:**
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural rhythm
- Spells out acronyms on first use (TAI, IATA)
- Explains technical terms in context ("wet lease," "wide-body aircraft," "Combi")
- Uses narrative flow and transitions rather than encyclopedic bullet points
- Adds context (comparing to Ethiopian Airlines and Air Afrique)

**Content preserved:**
- All key dates and facts from the original
- Aircraft types and fleet evolution
- Political context (apartheid sanctions, 2001 crisis)
- Ownership structure and privatization attempts
- Current operational status

The file is ready to be written to `/docs/wikipedia/madagascar-airlines/index.html` once you grant write permissions for that new directory.
