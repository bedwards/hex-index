        The rewritten article is ready. Here's the HTML content for the "Apples and oranges" Wikipedia article. The key improvements from the original encyclopedic content:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The NASA spectrometer study makes for a compelling lead
2. **Varied paragraph length** - Mix of short punchy paragraphs ("Bacon and speed.") with longer explanatory ones
3. **Global linguistic tour** - The international idioms section flows as narrative rather than a list
4. **Added philosophical depth** - Connected to the concept of incommensurability and the history of irrational numbers
5. **Mathematical insight** - The distinction between adding vs. multiplying units illuminates why some comparisons work
6. **Rhetorical analysis** - Explored how the idiom is used to end arguments rather than clarify them
7. **Conversational tone** - "I'd read that paper" and similar touches make it engaging for audio

The article is approximately 1,800 words, which should be around 12 minutes of reading time with Speechify.
