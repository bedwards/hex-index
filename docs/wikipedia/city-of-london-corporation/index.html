<h2>The Medieval Government Hiding in Plain Sight</h2>

<p>Somewhere in the heart of modern London, surrounded by gleaming skyscrapers and some of the world's most sophisticated financial institutions, there exists a government that has operated continuously since before anyone wrote down when it began. The City of London Corporation is so old that when King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215, he didn't create its rights—he merely confirmed liberties the City already possessed.</p>

<p>This is not the government that runs London. That would be the Greater London Authority, created in the year 2000 and headed by the Mayor of London. No, the City of London Corporation governs just the "Square Mile," a tiny patch of land that happens to be where the Romans first built their settlement of Londinium nearly two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>And here's where it gets genuinely strange: in this ancient jurisdiction, businesses get to vote.</p>

<h2>One Square Mile, Two Electorates</h2>

<p>In every other part of the United Kingdom, the principle of "one person, one vote" holds sway. The idea that a corporation might cast ballots was abolished nationwide in 1969. But the City of London exists in a legal bubble of its own making, and within that bubble, the medieval past never quite ended.</p>

<p>About nine thousand people actually live within the City's boundaries. Most of them reside in the Barbican Estate, a brutalist housing complex that looks like something from a science fiction film. But the business vote dwarfs the residential vote by a factor of nearly three to one. In 2009, businesses controlled approximately twenty-four thousand votes compared to the residents' share.</p>

<p>How does a company vote? It appoints representatives based on how many workers it employs. A small firm with fewer than ten employees gets one voter. A medium-sized business with ten to fifty workers gets one voter for every five employees. Large corporations with more than fifty workers get ten voters plus an additional voter for every fifty workers beyond the first fifty.</p>

<p>Think about what this means. A major bank headquartered in the Square Mile might have hundreds of appointed voters, each one casting a ballot in local elections. These aren't the workers themselves voting—they're people chosen by the company to represent its interests.</p>

<h2>Older Than Parliament</h2>

<p>The City of London Corporation claims to be the oldest continuously functioning democratic institution in the world. This is a bold statement, but it has some merit.</p>

<p>There is no founding charter. No single document establishes when the Corporation came into being. The law simply presumes it has always existed because it has been treated as existing for so long that no one can remember otherwise. Legal scholars call this "incorporation by prescription"—if everyone has always acted as though something is true, the law eventually accepts that it must be.</p>

<p>The earliest recorded royal charter dates from around 1067, when William the Conqueror—fresh from his victory at the Battle of Hastings—granted the citizens of London a document confirming rights they had enjoyed since the reign of Edward the Confessor. William was a pragmatic ruler. He had just conquered a kingdom, but he understood that London's merchants and traders were too useful to antagonize.</p>

<p>That decision set a pattern that would repeat for nearly a thousand years. Kings and queens came and went. Dynasties rose and fell. But the City of London maintained its special status through a simple calculation: it controlled money that monarchs needed.</p>

<h2>The Structure of Medieval Democracy</h2>

<p>To understand how the Corporation works, you need to understand three separate bodies that share power in ways that would baffle a modern management consultant.</p>

<p>At the top sits the Lord Mayor of London. This is not the same person as the Mayor of London—a confusion that the Corporation itself finds useful. The Mayor of London, currently an elected position, runs the vast metropolis of Greater London with its nine million inhabitants. The Lord Mayor of London presides over the Square Mile and its nine thousand residents, but does so with considerably more pomp and historical pageantry.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor is chosen by an electorate called Common Hall, which consists of the senior members of London's livery companies. These are the descendants of medieval trade guilds—the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, the Merchant Taylors, the Fishmongers, and over a hundred others. Most have long since ceased to have any connection to their original trades, but they retain the power to choose the City's ceremonial head.</p>

<p>Below the Lord Mayor sits the Court of Aldermen. Each of the City's twenty-five wards elects one alderman for a six-year term. In the past, aldermen served for life—a practice that only changed relatively recently by the Corporation's ancient standards. Aldermen must be Freemen of the City, which sounds exclusive until you learn that becoming a Freeman is largely a matter of paperwork and tradition rather than wealth or birth.</p>

<p>The real governing power rests with the Court of Common Council, formally known as "the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London in Common Council assembled." This body has existed since at least 1376 and serves as the City's legislature. Common councilmen are elected by ward residents and business voters every four years. They can add the letters "CC" after their names, joining that peculiar British tradition of postnominal alphabet soup.</p>

<h2>When the King Tried to Break the City</h2>

<p>The Corporation has survived nearly a millennium, but it hasn't always been smooth sailing. In 1683, King Charles II decided he'd had enough of London's independent streak.</p>

<p>Charles used a legal procedure called a writ of "quo warranto"—Latin for "by what authority?" This was a way for the crown to challenge whether a corporation had the legal right to exist. If the City couldn't prove its charter, Charles reasoned, it couldn't claim any special privileges.</p>

<p>It worked. The City's liberties were stripped away.</p>

<p>But Charles died in 1685, and his brother James II lasted only three years before being deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The new monarchs, William III and Mary II, needed friends. In 1690, Parliament passed an act restoring and confirming all the City's ancient privileges.</p>

<p>The Corporation learned an important lesson: kings are temporary, but the City endures.</p>

<h2>The Peculiar Officials</h2>

<p>Because of its accumulated wealth and unique status, the Corporation maintains a collection of officers that would seem bizarre in any other local government.</p>

<p>The Town Clerk serves as chief executive, an ancient title for what is essentially a modern civil service role. The Chamberlain handles the City's finances—not to be confused with the Lord Chamberlain, who manages the royal household.</p>

<p>The City Remembrancer might have the most intriguing title. This official handles protocol, ceremony, and security, but also monitors Parliament for any legislation that might affect the Corporation's interests. The Remembrancer sits in the House of Commons during debates, watching for threats to the City's autonomy. It is the only non-parliamentary seat in the Commons chamber.</p>

<p>The Recorder of London serves as the senior judge at the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court. Technically, this makes the Recorder a member of the Court of Aldermen, though without the ability to vote. It's a reminder that the City once administered its own justice system, separate from the crown's courts.</p>

<p>The Common Serjeant ranks as the second senior judge at the Old Bailey. The title derives from "Serjeant at Law," an ancient rank of barrister that was abolished in the nineteenth century everywhere except in the City of London's ceremonial usage.</p>

<h2>The Great Fire and the Sewers</h2>

<p>In 1666, the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city within the walls. The reconstruction that followed transformed London's physical infrastructure, but it also created a curious administrative quirk that would last for over two centuries.</p>

<p>A separate Commission of Sewers was established to manage the City's drains, street cleaning, lighting, and—oddly—churchyards and burials. The commissioners were nominated by the Corporation but operated as an independent body.</p>

<p>This arrangement persisted until 1898, when the City of London Sewers Act finally transferred all these powers to the Corporation itself. For the first time, the Common Council gained the full right to collect local taxes for all municipal services.</p>

<p>It seems absurd that sewage administration should be a matter of constitutional significance. But in a city where precedent matters more than logic, the right to manage drains represented real power.</p>

<h2>The Liberties That Survived</h2>

<p>Clause IX of the Magna Carta reads, in translation: "The City of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties and free customs, both by land and by water."</p>

<p>This clause remains in statute today. It has survived the repeal of nearly every other provision of the great charter. It has outlasted absolute monarchy, civil war, world wars, and the creation of the welfare state.</p>

<p>What "ancient liberties" actually means has evolved over time. Today, it translates into the Corporation's unique ability to govern itself, to alter its own constitution through Acts of Common Council, and to maintain traditions that would be illegal anywhere else in Britain.</p>

<p>The business vote is the most controversial of these liberties. Critics argue that it gives corporations undue influence over a local government. Defenders counter that the City's resident population is so small that excluding businesses would leave the Square Mile effectively unrepresentable.</p>

<h2>The City Within the City</h2>

<p>Not everything within the Square Mile falls under the Corporation's authority. The Inner Temple and Middle Temple—two of the four Inns of Court where barristers train—occupy land on the western edge of the City but remain "extra-parochial," meaning they exist outside normal parish boundaries.</p>

<p>These peculiar territories govern themselves. They are remnants of the Knights Templar, the crusading order that was suppressed in 1312. The Templars' lands passed to the Knights Hospitaller, then to the crown, and eventually became the province of the legal profession. To this day, the Inns of Court maintain their own governance, though many of the Corporation's statutory functions extend into their territory.</p>

<h2>What the Corporation Actually Does</h2>

<p>For all its medieval trappings, the Corporation functions as a local authority. It maintains roads, collects rubbish, operates markets, runs schools, and provides social services.</p>

<p>But it does much more than a typical borough council. The Corporation owns and manages land across London and beyond. It maintains Hampstead Heath, Epping Forest, and several other open spaces far outside its tiny jurisdiction. It runs the Barbican Centre, one of Europe's largest performing arts venues. It operates Smithfield Market, where meat has been traded since the tenth century.</p>

<p>The Corporation also runs its own police force. The City of London Police is entirely separate from the Metropolitan Police, which covers the rest of London. This arrangement dates from the creation of the Met in 1829, when the City successfully argued that it should keep its own constables.</p>

<p>Perhaps most significantly, the Corporation represents the interests of Britain's financial services industry. This advocacy role is explicit and unapologetic. The Lord Mayor spends much of their one-year term traveling the world as an ambassador for British finance.</p>

<h2>The Electoral Peculiarities</h2>

<p>The rules for voting in City elections are remarkably specific, reflecting centuries of accumulated tweaks and adjustments.</p>

<p>To be appointed as a business voter, an individual must meet one of several criteria. They must have worked for the appointing body at City premises for the past year. Or they must have served on the board of directors for the past year. Or they must have worked in the City for the body for a cumulative total of five years. Or they must have worked mainly in the City for a total of ten years and still do so or have done within the last five years.</p>

<p>The qualifying date is the first of September in the year of the election. Workers count toward a company's workforce regardless of nationality, but only certain categories of people can actually be appointed to vote.</p>

<p>If someone is appointed as a business voter but also lives in another local authority district, they keep their residential vote in their home district. The business vote is additional, not a replacement.</p>

<h2>The Ward System</h2>

<p>The City of London is divided into twenty-five wards, each electing one alderman and a variable number of common councilmen based on the size of the electorate. These wards have names that echo across centuries: Bread Street, Cheap, Farringdon Within, Farringdon Without, Lime Street, Tower.</p>

<p>Some wards have only a handful of residents. Others are dominated by major corporate headquarters. The mix of residential and business voters varies enormously from ward to ward, creating very different electoral dynamics in different parts of the Square Mile.</p>

<p>Ward boundaries have been adjusted over time, but the basic structure—each ward sending representatives to both the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Common Council—has remained stable for centuries.</p>

<h2>The Livery Companies</h2>

<p>Over one hundred livery companies exist in London today. They originated as guilds, regulating trades and protecting their members' interests. The Worshipful Company of Weavers claims to be the oldest, with a royal charter dating from 1155.</p>

<p>Modern livery companies have evolved far beyond their original purposes. Some, like the Goldsmiths and the Fishmongers, still play regulatory roles in their industries. Others exist primarily as charitable and social organizations. Newer companies have been created to represent modern professions—there is now a Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.</p>

<p>The senior members of livery companies, called liverymen, form the electorate that chooses the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs. This is done at Common Hall, an assembly that meets at the Guildhall on specific dates fixed by tradition. Sheriffs are chosen on Midsummer Day. The Lord Mayor is chosen on Michaelmas, the feast of Saint Michael on the twenty-ninth of September.</p>

<p>To become Lord Mayor, one must first have served as Sheriff. This requirement creates a clear path of progression through the City's hierarchy: freeman, liveryman, common councilman, alderman, sheriff, and finally Lord Mayor.</p>

<h2>The Ceremonial Heart</h2>

<p>The Lord Mayor's role is largely ceremonial, but ceremony should not be confused with insignificance. The Lord Mayor chairs the Court of Aldermen and the Common Council. They head the Commission of Lieutenancy, an ancient military body. They serve as Admiral of the Port of London, Chancellor of City University, President of Gresham College, and Trustee of Saint Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>Each November, the new Lord Mayor processes through the streets of London in the Lord Mayor's Show, a parade that has occurred annually since 1535. The golden State Coach, built in 1757, carries the Lord Mayor through cheering crowds. It is one of the oldest and grandest civic ceremonies in the world.</p>

<p>But real political power in the Corporation resides elsewhere—in the chair of the Policy and Resources Committee, who provides day-to-day leadership on the Corporation's strategic direction.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>

<p>The City of London Corporation is an anomaly, a medieval survivor in a modern democracy. Its defenders argue that its unique structure has served London well for a thousand years, providing stable governance for a financial center that generates enormous tax revenue for the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Its critics see it as a relic that gives corporations undue influence over local government, a closed shop protected by ancient privilege rather than democratic legitimacy. They note that the business vote effectively allows companies to have representation without the taxation that would normally justify it.</p>

<p>What cannot be denied is that the Corporation endures. It has outlasted the feudal system that created it. It has survived every attempt at reform, every change of regime, every transformation of British society. When Charles II stripped its privileges, it got them back. When Parliament created the Greater London Authority, the Corporation remained separate.</p>

<p>In the shadow of modern skyscrapers, aldermen still process in scarlet robes. Liverymen still gather at Common Hall to choose their Lord Mayor. The City Remembrancer still watches Parliament for threats to ancient liberties.</p>

<p>The past is not dead. In the Square Mile, it isn't even past.</p>
