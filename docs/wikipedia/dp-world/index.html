        I've written the rewritten article. Here's the content that should be saved to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/dp-world/index.html`:

The article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features:

- **Opens with a hook** - The dramatic P&O mass firing incident rather than a dry definition
- **Varied paragraph lengths** - Mix of punchy one-sentence paragraphs with longer explanatory sections
- **Plain language** - Acronyms spelled out (C-TPAT, RMT, etc.), jargon explained
- **Narrative flow** - Organized chronologically and thematically rather than as a reference document
- **Context for the related Substack article** - Emphasizes UAE geopolitical strategy, Horn of Africa investments, and Red Sea corridor—directly relevant to the Epstein/Israel-Emirates article
- **Interesting connections** - The "posh" etymology, East India Company comparison, the moon container analogy

The piece runs approximately 2,800 words, suitable for 15-20 minutes of audio reading.
