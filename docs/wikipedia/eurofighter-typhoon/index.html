        The Wikipedia article rewrite is ready. Here's the transformed essay about the Eurofighter Typhoon:

**Key changes from the original:**

1. **Hook-first opening** - Instead of starting with a dry definition, it opens with the ironic observation about four countries building the same jet four times

2. **Narrative flow** - The piece follows the development chronologically but with editorial voice, explaining why things happened rather than just listing facts

3. **Technical concepts explained** - Aerodynamic instability and fly-by-wire systems are explained from first principles for a general audience

4. **Interesting angles highlighted** - The commitment mechanism that prevented Germany from withdrawing, the workshare negotiations that led to inefficient four-way production

5. **Acronyms spelled out** - NATO, AMRAAM, EAP, etc. are all expanded on first use

6. **Varied paragraph structure** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs ("France didn't want the same airplane.") with longer explanatory ones

7. **Speechify-friendly** - Clean semantic HTML, no jargon without explanation, natural reading rhythm

The essay covers the program's history, the technical capabilities of the aircraft, cost overruns, export battles, comparisons with competitors, and draws lessons about international defense cooperation. It's approximately 3,000 words, suitable for a 15-20 minute read or listen.
