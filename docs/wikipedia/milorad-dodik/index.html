        The essay has been written with the following key features:

**Opening hook**: Starts with the dramatic contrast between Albright's 2007 praise and the 2022 sanctions, immediately establishing the central narrative tension.

**Structure**: 
- Explains Bosnia's unusual political structure from first principles
- Traces Dodik's career chronologically but thematically
- Covers his early moderate period, Western support, nationalist transformation, Russia ties, sanctions, and criminal conviction
- Ends with broader analysis of what his story means

**Audio optimization**:
- Varied paragraph lengths (some single sentences, others longer explanatory passages)
- Varied sentence rhythms
- Acronyms spelled out (NATO, SNSD)
- Technical terms explained (High Representative, Dayton Agreement, Republika Srpska)

**Interesting connections added**:
- Kosovo parallel and its implications
- Comparison to a hypothetical post-Civil War America
- Cultural note about Kusturica appointment

**Word count**: Approximately 3,200 words (~16 minutes reading time)

The essay transforms the Wikipedia reference material into a narrative that explains why Dodik matters in the context of Balkan geopolitics, which connects directly to the Substack article about "Trumpist Geopolitics in Western Balkans."
