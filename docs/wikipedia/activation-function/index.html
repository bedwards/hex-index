        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on activation functions. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the 2012 deep learning revolution
- Explains linear vs. nonlinear transformations from first principles
- Traces the biological inspiration from neuroscience
- Walks through the history from sigmoid to ReLU to GELU
- Explains the vanishing gradient problem in accessible terms
- Covers the ReLU family of variations
- Discusses radial basis functions, softmax, and pooling
- Addresses mathematical properties like saturation and monotonicity
- Touches on quantum neural networks
- Connects back to the related Substack article about AI introspection

The essay is approximately 2,400 words (about 12-15 minutes of reading), varies paragraph and sentence length for good Speechify rhythm, and avoids jargon while explaining technical concepts from first principles.

However, I need permission to create the directory and write the file. Could you grant write permissions for the docs/wikipedia/activation-function/ directory?
