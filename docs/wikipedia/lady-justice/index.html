        I've written the essay on Lady Justice. Here's a summary of the rewritten content:

**The Rewritten Article** transforms the Wikipedia reference material into an engaging ~2,400 word essay (~15 minute read) optimized for Speechify text-to-speech. Key features:

1. **Hook-first structure**: Opens with the surprising fact that the blindfold started as satire, not celebration

2. **Narrative flow**: Traces Lady Justice from Egyptian goddess Maat through Roman Justitia to modern courthouse statues

3. **Varied rhythm**: Mixes punchy one-sentence paragraphs ("Somehow, over the centuries, the insult became an ideal.") with longer explanatory sections

4. **Contemporary relevance**: Integrates India's 2024 Supreme Court redesign that removed both blindfold and sword

5. **Conceptual differentiation**: Explains related figures (Prudentia, Adikia, Nemesis) and the tension between justice, retribution, and mercy

6. **Interesting connections**: Covers everything from Metallica's album art to Korean legal dramas to heraldry across cultures

7. **Clean HTML structure**: Uses semantic `<h2>` headings, `<p>` paragraphs, no widgets or distractions

The essay connects to the MAGA Supreme Court context by exploring how justice can be corrupted when the powerful control the institutions—without being preachy about it.
