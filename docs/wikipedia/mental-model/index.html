        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about mental models. Here's the HTML content:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model">Wikipedia: Mental model</a></p>

<p>You have never seen reality. Not once. What you experience as the world is actually a sophisticated simulation running inside your skull—a small-scale model your brain builds and continuously updates, using the sparse data trickling in through your senses. This isn't philosophy. It's cognitive science.</p>

<p>And it explains why two people can witness the same event and walk away with completely different accounts of what happened.</p>

<h2>The Mapmaker's Dilemma</h2>

<p>In 1943, a Scottish psychologist named Kenneth Craik made an observation that would reshape how we think about thinking itself. In his book <em>The Nature of Explanation</em>, Craik proposed that the mind doesn't passively record reality like a camera. Instead, it actively constructs "small-scale models" that it uses to anticipate what will happen next.</p>

<p>Think about catching a ball. You don't calculate the physics—the parabolic arc, the gravitational constant, the wind resistance. Your brain runs a quick simulation based on its internal model of how objects move through space. The ball lands in your hand before your conscious mind has any idea what just happened.</p>

<p>This is a mental model in action.</p>

<p>Jay Wright Forrester, the systems dynamics pioneer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put it memorably in 1971: "The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system."</p>

<p>That word "selected" is crucial. Your mental models aren't comprehensive—they can't be. They're radically simplified representations, like a subway map that shows you how stations connect but tells you nothing about the neighborhoods above ground. This simplification is both their power and their peril.</p>

<h2>How We Actually Reason</h2>

<p>For decades, cognitive scientists assumed that human reasoning worked like formal logic—that somewhere in your brain, a little philosopher was checking whether conclusions followed validly from premises. But the evidence kept pointing elsewhere.</p>

<p>Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth Byrne developed what became known as the mental model theory of reasoning, and it upended the traditional view. According to their research, when you reason through a problem, you don't manipulate abstract logical symbols. You construct mental models of the possibilities and then check whether your conclusion holds across all of them.</p>

<p>Here's how it works in practice. Consider this statement: "If it's raining, the streets are wet." Your mind doesn't encode this as a logical formula. Instead, it builds a mental model—a kind of mental picture of a rainy day with wet streets. When asked whether wet streets mean it's raining, you search your model for counterexamples. Can the streets be wet for other reasons? A sprinkler, perhaps, or a street-cleaning truck? If you find a counterexample, you reject the conclusion. If you can't, you accept it.</p>

<p>This explains why human reasoning is both powerful and systematically flawed. We're good at finding obvious counterexamples but terrible at generating all the possibilities we should consider. Our working memory can only hold so many models at once—typically just one or two. Complex problems with many possibilities overwhelm us.</p>

<h2>The Iconicity Principle</h2>

<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of mental models is their structure. Unlike formal logical systems, which use abstract symbols that bear no resemblance to what they represent, mental models are what researchers call "iconic." Each part of the model corresponds to each part of what it represents.</p>

<p>This is similar to how an architect's scale model of a building works. The tiny doors in the model represent real doors. The miniature windows represent real windows. The spatial relationships in the model mirror the spatial relationships in the actual structure. You can walk around the model and understand how the building will look from different angles—something you couldn't do with just a blueprint.</p>

<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher, had intuited something similar in 1922 with his "picture theory of language." He proposed that meaningful statements work by picturing possible states of affairs in the world. The mental model theorists took this idea and gave it empirical teeth.</p>

<p>But here's where it gets interesting: mental models are based on what researchers call a "principle of truth." They typically represent only what is true in a given possibility, not what is false. This is cognitively efficient—it's much easier to model what exists than to model the infinite space of what doesn't exist. But it also creates blind spots. We tend to overlook what's absent from our models.</p>

<h2>The Limitations We Live With</h2>

<p>Mental models come with an uncomfortable set of constraints that shape every decision you make.</p>

<p>First, they're built on imperfect foundations. The facts feeding into your mental models are often incomplete, ambiguous, or flat-out wrong. You construct your model of the economy from news headlines, personal experience, and half-remembered statistics. None of these are comprehensive or necessarily accurate.</p>

<p>Second, mental models act as information filters. Once you have a model of how something works, you tend to notice information that confirms it and overlook information that contradicts it. Psychologists call this confirmation bias, but it's really a feature of how models work—they determine what counts as relevant data in the first place.</p>

<p>Third, they're radically simplified compared to the systems they represent. The global economy involves billions of actors making trillions of decisions. Your mental model of the economy might have a few dozen concepts: interest rates, unemployment, inflation, consumer confidence, government spending. This compression is necessary for thinking to happen at all, but it means your model will always miss important dynamics.</p>

<p>Fourth, they're dependent on your sources of information. If your news diet consists entirely of one political perspective, your mental models will reflect that perspective. If you've never traveled outside your country, your mental models of other cultures will be based on secondhand accounts and stereotypes. The raw material constrains the model.</p>

<h2>Gravity in Your Head</h2>

<p>Some mental models appear to be hardwired. Researchers conducting experiments in weightlessness—both in space and in parabolic flight—have discovered that humans come equipped with an internal model of how gravity affects moving objects. This isn't something we learn; it's part of our cognitive architecture.</p>

<p>When astronauts first experience microgravity, they consistently misjudge how objects will move. They reach for a floating pen and miss because their brain's built-in physics engine is predicting a downward arc that doesn't happen. Over time, they adapt, building new models appropriate to their environment. But the original gravity model never entirely disappears—it reasserts itself immediately upon return to Earth.</p>

<p>This research reveals something profound about mental models: they're not purely learned constructs. Evolution has equipped us with certain baseline models because getting physics wrong, for our ancestors, meant falling out of trees or failing to catch prey. The models that helped us survive got baked into the hardware.</p>

<h2>Organizations That Learn (and Those That Don't)</h2>

<p>Mental models aren't just individual phenomena. They shape how entire organizations think and act.</p>

<p>When researchers study organizational learning, they often find that the biggest barrier to change isn't lack of information or resources—it's the mental models that employees and leaders carry around. These "deeply held images of thinking and acting" are so basic to how people understand their work that they're barely conscious of them.</p>

<p>Consider how a traditional taxi company might think about transportation. Their mental model includes concepts like dispatchers, medallions, geographic territories, and per-mile rates. When a company like Uber emerged, it wasn't just offering a new product—it was operating from an entirely different mental model, one built around smartphone apps, rating systems, surge pricing, and drivers who aren't employees. The taxi companies weren't just beaten on price or convenience; their entire mental model of transportation became obsolete.</p>

<p>Systems thinkers have developed tools for making mental models explicit so they can be examined and updated. Causal loop diagrams show how variables influence each other, revealing feedback loops that might not be obvious. Stock and flow diagrams quantify how things accumulate and deplete over time. These techniques force people to externalize their internal models, making hidden assumptions visible and debatable.</p>

<h2>Two Ways to Learn</h2>

<p>When something goes wrong, there are two fundamentally different ways to respond.</p>

<p>The first is single-loop learning. You notice the error, adjust your behavior, and try again. The mental model itself stays intact; you just get better at operating within it. If you burn your toast, you turn down the heat next time. The model—"toaster with this dial position equals properly browned bread"—remains unchanged; you just recalibrate the input.</p>

<p>Most learning is single-loop. It's efficient and low-cost. You don't need to rethink everything every time something goes slightly wrong.</p>

<p>But sometimes single-loop learning isn't enough. Sometimes the model itself is broken, and no amount of adjustment within the model will fix the problem. This requires double-loop learning—stepping back and questioning the assumptions underlying your mental model.</p>

<p>Double-loop learning is harder, slower, and more psychologically uncomfortable. It requires admitting that you've been thinking about something wrong, possibly for years. But it's also the only way to handle situations where the environment has fundamentally changed. The taxi company that kept optimizing its dispatch system was engaged in single-loop learning; the company that asked "what if transportation doesn't require owning cars or employing drivers?" was engaged in double-loop learning.</p>

<h2>The Ongoing Debate</h2>

<p>Not everyone accepts that mental models are the primary engine of human reasoning. The scientific debate continues.</p>

<p>Some researchers argue that we reason using formal rules of inference—not conscious logical rules, but unconscious mental operations that function like logic. Others propose that we have domain-specific reasoning modules, evolved mechanisms that handle particular types of problems (like detecting cheaters in social exchanges) with their own specialized rules. Still others argue that human reasoning is fundamentally probabilistic—that we're intuitive statisticians, constantly updating our beliefs based on the likelihood of different outcomes.</p>

<p>These aren't merely academic disputes. They have real implications for how we design education, build artificial intelligence systems, and structure decision-making processes. If reasoning is based on mental models, then improving reasoning means improving the models—giving people richer, more accurate representations to work with. If reasoning is probabilistic, then improving reasoning means helping people better calibrate their sense of likelihoods. If reasoning uses formal rules, then logic training might actually help.</p>

<p>The mental model theorists have a substantial body of evidence on their side, including detailed predictions about which reasoning problems will be easy and which will be hard, predictions that have been confirmed in experiment after experiment. But science progresses by argument, and this argument is far from settled.</p>

<h2>Living With Models</h2>

<p>Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, became famous for advocating what he called "multiple mental models." His argument was simple: if you only have one model for understanding the world, you'll force every problem into that model's framework, even when it doesn't fit. The old saying goes, "To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."</p>

<p>Munger's solution was to build a latticework of mental models drawn from multiple disciplines—psychology, economics, physics, biology, mathematics. When approaching a problem, you could then reach for whichever model best fit the situation. A problem that looks intractable through an economic lens might yield immediately to a psychological one.</p>

<p>This is practical wisdom dressed in cognitive science clothing. But it also points to a deeper truth about mental models: they're not just descriptions of reality, they're tools for navigating it. And like any tools, the right one depends on the job at hand.</p>

<p>The map is not the territory. But without maps, we'd be lost. The challenge is to remember that we're always working with models, to seek out better models when ours fail, and to hold our models loosely enough that we can update them when reality refuses to cooperate.</p>

<p>Your brain is constructing a model of these very words as you read them, fitting them into your existing understanding, checking them against what you already believe. Some of what you're reading will slide smoothly into place. Some of it might create friction, suggesting that your model—or mine—needs revision.</p>

<p>That friction is where learning happens.</p>

The article is approximately 2,400 words and should take about 12-15 minutes to read aloud. It opens with an attention-grabbing hook, varies paragraph and sentence lengths for good audio rhythm, explains technical concepts from first principles, and includes interesting connections (like the Charlie Munger latticework concept and the taxi/Uber disruption example) that weren't in the original Wikipedia article.
