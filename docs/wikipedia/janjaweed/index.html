<h2>Devils on Horseback</h2>

<p>The name itself tells you something is terribly wrong. Janjaweed. In Arabic, it likely combines the words for "demon" and "horsemen"—devils on horseback. Other etymologies point to Persian words for "warriors" or even a mashup incorporating the English word "gun." Whatever its precise origins, the name has become synonymous with some of the worst atrocities of the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>The Janjaweed are a Sudanese Arab militia, and their story is inseparable from the vast, sun-scorched region of Darfur in western Sudan. To understand who they are and what they have done, you need to understand the landscape they emerged from—and the ancient tensions that drought, politics, and foreign meddling transformed into genocide.</p>

<h2>A Land of Nomads and Farmers</h2>

<p>Darfur sits in the Sahel, that semi-arid belt stretching across Africa just below the Sahara Desert. It is a region defined by scarcity. Water is precious. Grazing land even more so.</p>

<p>For centuries, two ways of life coexisted here, sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. There were the sedentary farmers who worked the land, growing crops in the brief rainy season. And there were the nomadic herders, moving their animals across vast distances in search of pasture and water.</p>

<p>The Janjaweed drew primarily from the Abbala Arabs, people who traditionally herded camels across the Sahel's harsh terrain. The word Abbala itself comes from the Arabic for "camel herders." Their lifestyle required constant movement, and that movement inevitably brought them into conflict with settled communities. Whose land was whose? Who had the right to water sources? These questions simmered for generations.</p>

<p>Then the droughts came.</p>

<h2>When the Rains Failed</h2>

<p>Climate change—though it was not called that yet—began squeezing the Sahel in the 1970s and 1980s. Rainfall became erratic, then scarce. The desert crept southward. Pastures that had sustained nomadic herds for generations withered.</p>

<p>Competition for resources intensified dramatically. Nomads pushed farther into farming territories. Farmers resisted. What had been occasional disputes became chronic low-level warfare. Between 1985 and 1988, ethnic violence in Darfur killed approximately nine thousand people—a number that would later seem almost quaint compared to what followed.</p>

<p>But the Janjaweed were not yet a coherent force. They were just one part of a complex web of tribal militias, ethnic tensions, and local grievances. What transformed them into something far more dangerous was the intervention of outside powers with their own agendas.</p>

<h2>Gaddafi's Shadow</h2>

<p>Muammar Gaddafi, the mercurial Libyan dictator, saw opportunity in Darfur's chaos. Throughout the 1980s, he pursued a pan-Arab ideology that imagined unifying Arab peoples across North Africa under his leadership. Darfur, with its significant Arab population and porous borders, became a staging ground for his ambitions.</p>

<p>Gaddafi backed the creation of something called the Tajammu al-Arabi—the Arab Gathering. One historian, Gérard Prunier, described it bluntly as "a militantly racist and pan-Arabist organization which stressed the 'Arab' character of the province." This was ideology married to weapons, and Gaddafi supplied plenty of both.</p>

<p>He also created the Islamic Legion, a mercenary force that recruited across the Sahel and fought in conflicts from Chad to Lebanon. Members flowed between the Islamic Legion and the Arab Gathering. The lines blurred. What mattered was that Gaddafi was arming and organizing Arab militias in the region, and some of those weapons and fighters would eventually form the core of the Janjaweed.</p>

<h2>Birth of a Militia</h2>

<p>The year 1988 marks the Janjaweed's emergence as a distinct force, and the circumstances were almost absurd in their geopolitical complexity.</p>

<p>Chad, Darfur's western neighbor, had been wracked by civil war for decades. Gaddafi had backed various Chadian factions, but in 1988, Chadian president Hissène Habré—supported by France and the United States—decisively defeated the Libyan army. One of Gaddafi's Chadian allies, a man named Acheikh Ibn-Oumar, fled with his fighters into Darfur.</p>

<p>They found shelter with Sheikh Musa Hilal.</p>

<p>Hilal was the newly elevated chief of the Rizeigat, one of the major Arab tribes of northern Darfur. His tribesmen had already been smuggling Libyan weapons to Ibn-Oumar's forces. Now they became hosts to an entire armed faction.</p>

<p>A French-Chadian military incursion eventually destroyed Ibn-Oumar's camp. But here is the crucial detail: the weapons stayed behind. Sheikh Hilal's people inherited a small arsenal, and with it, the capacity for organized violence on a new scale.</p>

<p>The Janjaweed had arrived.</p>

<h2>A Useful Tool</h2>

<p>Throughout the 1990s, the Janjaweed remained a local phenomenon. They pursued land and resources, harassing non-Arab communities, but they operated without central coordination or state backing. The Sudanese government in Khartoum, far to the east, tolerated them but did not control them.</p>

<p>That changed around 1999.</p>

<p>Rebel movements were stirring in western Sudan. Groups like the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement began organizing, demanding greater autonomy and resources for Darfur's marginalized populations. The government in Khartoum faced a choice: send its regular army to fight an insurgency in difficult terrain, or use the tools already at hand.</p>

<p>They chose the Janjaweed.</p>

<p>Khartoum's security services began arming and coordinating the militias. What had been a loose collection of tribal fighters became something approaching a paramilitary force—one that could be pointed at the government's enemies while maintaining a thin veneer of deniability. They were not soldiers. They were just... nomads. Traditional rivals. Local conflicts. Nothing to do with the government at all.</p>

<h2>The Darfur Genocide</h2>

<p>In February 2003, the insurgency in Darfur escalated. The Sudan Liberation Movement attacked government installations. The Justice and Equality Movement launched coordinated operations. Khartoum's response was swift and brutal.</p>

<p>The Janjaweed became the primary instrument of counter-insurgency. But "counter-insurgency" is too clean a word for what happened. The militias did not simply fight rebels. They attacked entire villages. They burned crops. They poisoned wells. They murdered civilians—men, women, children—without discrimination. They raped systematically, using sexual violence as a weapon of terror and ethnic destruction.</p>

<p>The pattern was consistent enough to suggest coordination. Sudanese military aircraft would bomb a village from the air. Then the Janjaweed would arrive on horseback and camelback to complete the destruction on the ground. Survivors who fled found the militias waiting at water sources or along escape routes. Those who made it to refugee camps discovered that the Janjaweed patrolled the perimeters, attacking anyone who ventured out.</p>

<p>By 2007, estimates of the death toll ranged from two hundred thousand to four hundred thousand people. Millions more were displaced, living in sprawling refugee camps in Darfur and across the border in Chad.</p>

<p>The United States government officially declared it genocide. The United Nations Security Council called for the Janjaweed to be disarmed—a call that went unheeded. In 2008, the International Criminal Court charged Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir with genocide, accusing him of masterminding a campaign of murder, rape, and deportation against African tribes in Darfur.</p>

<p>He remained in power for another eleven years.</p>

<h2>From Militia to Institution</h2>

<p>Something curious happened to the Janjaweed as the years passed. Rather than being disbanded or held accountable, they were institutionalized.</p>

<p>By 2006, many Janjaweed fighters had been formally absorbed into Sudan's military structure—the regular army, the Popular Defense Forces, the Border Guards. The genocide suspects became government employees. Sheikh Musa Hilal, the man who had hosted Gaddafi's fleeing allies and armed the first Janjaweed, became a prominent political figure.</p>

<p>Then, in 2013, the Sudanese government created something new: the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. On paper, the RSF was a paramilitary unit tasked with fighting rebels in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile—Sudan's perpetually restive peripheries. In practice, the RSF was the Janjaweed with a new name and official sanction.</p>

<p>Its commander was Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known universally as Hemedti. He had risen through the Janjaweed ranks during the Darfur genocide and now commanded a force of tens of thousands—well-armed, well-funded, and answering directly to Sudan's leadership rather than the regular military chain of command.</p>

<h2>The Parallel Army</h2>

<p>The RSF became something unprecedented in Sudan: a second army. It had its own command structure, its own sources of income (including gold mining operations), and its own network of political alliances. While technically subordinate to the state, it operated with remarkable autonomy.</p>

<p>Hemedti cultivated international relationships. He sent RSF forces to fight in Yemen as part of the Saudi-led coalition there. He positioned himself as an ally against terrorism. He spoke the language of reform and democratic transition. Foreign governments that had once condemned the Janjaweed found themselves engaging with its successor organization as a legitimate partner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the regular Sudanese Army watched this parallel power structure with growing unease.</p>

<h2>The Reckoning of 2023</h2>

<p>In April 2019, mass protests finally toppled Omar al-Bashir after thirty years of authoritarian rule. What followed was supposed to be a transition to democracy. A civilian-military council would share power, eventually handing authority to elected leaders.</p>

<p>It did not work out that way.</p>

<p>The two key military figures in the transitional government were General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, commander of the regular army, and Hemedti, commander of the RSF. International diplomats, hoping to consolidate civilian control, pushed for the RSF to merge into the regular military structure. This would eliminate the parallel army problem—but it would also end Hemedti's independent power base.</p>

<p>The tensions proved irreconcilable.</p>

<p>On April 15, 2023, fighting erupted between RSF and army forces across Sudan. Within two days, seventy-eight people were reported dead, including three workers from the World Food Programme. The organization suspended its operations in a country already facing severe hunger. Battles raged in and around Khartoum, the capital—a city that had largely been spared the violence of Darfur.</p>

<p>The Janjaweed, in their newest incarnation, had come home.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Violence</h2>

<p>What makes the Janjaweed—and their successors—so troubling is not simply the scale of their atrocities, though that scale is staggering. It is the way their violence has been instrumentalized, legitimized, and ultimately institutionalized.</p>

<p>They began as one of many tribal militias in a region plagued by resource conflicts. They were armed and organized by a foreign dictator pursuing his own ambitions. They were deployed by a government seeking to crush dissent without dirtying its own hands. They were absorbed into official military structures rather than being disbanded. They were rebranded and granted international legitimacy. And finally, they grew powerful enough to threaten the state that had created them.</p>

<p>This trajectory—from militia to monster to institution to rival power center—offers a grim lesson in how violence, once unleashed, can take on a life of its own.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of a Name</h2>

<p>There is one more etymology for the word Janjaweed worth considering. Some scholars suggest it was first used as a political slur by François Tombalbaye, the Christian president of Chad, to marginalize his Muslim political opponents. If true, the name began as a tool of othering—a way of marking certain people as demons, as outside civilization, as less than human.</p>

<p>The irony is bitter. The men who took up that name would go on to treat their victims with exactly the dehumanizing brutality the label implied. Devils on horseback, living down to their name.</p>

<p>Today, as fighting continues across Sudan and millions flee their homes, the legacy of the Janjaweed remains unresolved. The International Criminal Court's warrants have never been executed. The victims of Darfur have never received justice. And the armed men who once patrolled the edges of refugee camps now contest control of an entire nation.</p>

<p>The devils dismounted from their horses long ago. They drive pickup trucks now, carry modern weapons, and command formations that function like armies. But they remain what they have always been: a force shaped by violence, sustained by impunity, and seemingly beyond accountability.</p>

<p>That is the story of the Janjaweed. It is not over.</p>
