        I've written a complete rewrite of the Price Fixing Wikipedia article. The article is approximately 2,800 words and transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading.

Key features of the rewrite:

- **Opens with the tuna price fixing scandal** - a concrete, surprising hook about executives going to prison for setting prices on canned fish
- **Explains the mechanics clearly** - what price fixing actually is, how conspiracies form, the different forms coordination can take
- **Covers the economic theory** - consumer surplus, deadweight loss, and why economists view price fixing as inefficient
- **Addresses the complexity** - how innocent parallel pricing differs from illegal coordination
- **Tours the legal landscape** - Sherman Act, triple damages, Qui Tam provisions, horizontal vs. vertical distinctions
- **Goes global** - Canada, Australia, New Zealand, EU, UK (including the fascinating Net Book Agreement)
- **Explains sovereign immunity** - why OPEC gets away with what would be illegal for private companies
- **Chronicles major prosecutions** - music industry, memory chips, LCD panels, capacitors, perfume, tuna
- **Deep dive on airlines** - the massive 21-airline cartel and $1.7 billion in fines
- **Connects to AI/algorithms** - the RealPage rental price investigation and questions about whether antitrust law can adapt
- **Includes the contrarian view** - libertarian objections to price fixing prohibitions
- **Varies sentence and paragraph length** throughout for audio rhythm
- **Spells out acronyms** - DRAM, IATA, OPEC explained on first use

The article connects well to the source Substack article about Google as an AI-powered central planner, as both touch on questions of algorithmic coordination and market power.

The file is ready to write to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/price-fixing/index.html` once you grant write permissions to that directory.
