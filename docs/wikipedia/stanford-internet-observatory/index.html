        I've written a comprehensive essay about the Stanford Internet Observatory that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the organization's collapse rather than a dry definition
- Explains the founding story through Alex Stamos's departure from Facebook
- Details the observatory's key achievements (Russian interference documentation, Clubhouse security concerns, Instagram child safety investigation)
- Provides context for the Election Integrity Partnership and why election misinformation monitoring matters
- Explains the political backlash in accessible terms, covering the "censorship-industrial complex" framing
- Chronicles the collapse through legal costs and staff departures
- Ends with reflection on the larger democratic implications

The essay varies sentence and paragraph length for audio listening, spells out concepts, and avoids jargon while maintaining substantive depth. It's ready to write once you grant permission to create the file at `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/stanford-internet-observatory/index.html`.
