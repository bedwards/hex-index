        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Galileo's "Two New Sciences." The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading, with:

- A compelling hook about a blind, elderly man under house arrest publishing a revolutionary book
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for natural audio rhythm
- Plain language explanations of concepts like the square-cube law and the brachistochrone problem
- Interesting connections (Apollo 15's feather drop, J.B.S. Haldane's later work, Newton's birth in 1642)
- Narrative flow tracing Galileo's intellectual journey through the book's four days
- A satisfying conclusion connecting Galileo's death to Newton's birth
