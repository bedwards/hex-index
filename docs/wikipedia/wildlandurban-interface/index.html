        I've completed rewriting the Wikipedia article about the wildland–urban interface. The content is ready to be written as an HTML file. Here's what I've created:

**Key features of the rewritten article:**

1. **Engaging hook** - Opens with a vivid image of embers riding the wind into new neighborhoods, rather than a dry definition
2. **Accessible explanations** - Spells out WUI pronunciation ("woo-ee") and explains technical concepts like Structure Separation Distance in plain language
3. **Varied rhythm** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs ("Here's the uncomfortable truth: we keep building homes in places that burn.") with longer explanatory sections
4. **Interesting connections** - Added the unexpected link between forest fragmentation and Lyme disease, and the physics connection to Huygens' principle
5. **Narrative flow** - Organized as an essay that builds understanding step by step rather than an encyclopedic reference
6. **Speechify-optimized** - Clean semantic HTML, no jargon without explanation, consistent paragraph length variation

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/wildland-urban-interface/index.html` but requires permission to create the directory. Would you like me to proceed once permissions are granted?
