<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhāna">Wikipedia: Dhyana in Buddhism</a></p>

<p>Here's a strange fact about the history of meditation: the practice that transformed ancient India, spread across Asia, and eventually became a multi-billion dollar wellness industry in the West might have started with a child sitting under a tree, having a spontaneous experience he couldn't explain.</p>

<p>According to Buddhist tradition, before Siddhartha Gautama became the Buddha, he tried everything. He studied under famous teachers. He starved himself nearly to death. He practiced harsh austerities that left him skeletal and weak. None of it worked. Then one day, discouraged and exhausted, he remembered something from his childhood: sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree while his father worked nearby, his mind had spontaneously entered a state of profound peace and clarity.</p>

<p>That memory changed everything.</p>

<p>"Could that be the path to Awakening?" he wondered. And according to the traditional account, it was.</p>

<h2>What Dhyana Actually Means</h2>

<p>The word we're exploring—dhyana in Sanskrit, jhana in the Pali language of the earliest Buddhist texts—has traveled a remarkable linguistic journey. It comes from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to see" or "to look," which evolved into the Sanskrit word for "imaginative vision." The term developed further to mean "to contemplate, meditate, think." Eventually, it became the Chinese word "chan" and then the Japanese "zen."</p>

<p>So when you hear someone talk about Zen Buddhism, they're literally talking about "meditation Buddhism"—a tradition named after this very practice.</p>

<p>But what is dhyana, exactly? The fifth-century scholar Buddhaghosa offered a poetic explanation: the word relates to both "thinking or meditating" and "burning up." The practice, he said, burns away the mental impurities that prevent clarity and peace. Think of it as controlled fire—not destroying the mind, but purifying it.</p>

<p>Modern translations usually render dhyana as "meditation" or "concentration," but these words don't quite capture what the early texts describe. The practice isn't just about focusing intently on something, like staring at a candle flame until your eyes water. It's closer to a systematic withdrawal from automatic mental reactions, leading to what one early text beautifully calls "a state of perfect equanimity and awareness."</p>

<h2>The Four Stages of Dhyana</h2>

<p>The Buddhist tradition describes four progressive stages of dhyana, each building on the last. Understanding these stages helps explain what practitioners are actually trying to accomplish—and why it matters.</p>

<p><strong>The first dhyana</strong> begins when the practitioner becomes separated from desire for sensual pleasures and from unwholesome mental states. This isn't suppression or denial. The texts describe it more like stepping back from the constant push and pull of wanting and not-wanting that normally dominates conscious experience. In this state, joy and pleasure arise—but they're born from discrimination, from seeing clearly rather than from getting what you want.</p>

<p>Crucially, in this first stage, thinking continues. The mind still investigates, still inquires. The practitioner hasn't become a vegetable; they've become more awake, not less.</p>

<p><strong>The second dhyana</strong> arrives when even this subtle mental activity quiets down. Joy and pleasure remain, but now they arise from what the texts call samadhi—a term usually translated as "concentration" but perhaps better understood as a kind of non-discursive awareness. The mind becomes unified, still, but not blank. One contemporary interpreter describes it as "bringing the buried tendencies into full view."</p>

<p>Think of the difference between a turbulent lake and a calm one. In the turbulent lake, you can't see the bottom. In the calm lake, everything becomes visible. The second dhyana is like that calm lake—the mind's habitual disturbances have settled, and previously hidden patterns become apparent.</p>

<p><strong>The third dhyana</strong> marks another transition. Even the joy fades away. What remains is equanimity, mindfulness, and a kind of bodily pleasure that's hard to translate. The noble ones, according to the texts, describe this as "abiding in pleasure while being equanimous and mindful." It's not the grasping pleasure of getting what you want; it's more like the simple pleasure of being alive and present, uncomplicated by desire or aversion.</p>

<p><strong>The fourth dhyana</strong> completes the progression. Now even the experience of pleasure and pain has been transcended. The practitioner abides in complete purity of equanimity and mindfulness—adukkham asukham, neither painful nor pleasurable, free from both.</p>

<p>This might sound like nihilism or numbness, but the texts insist it's neither. It's described as a state of profound clarity and peace, where the mind is perfectly balanced and completely aware. Not checked out, but fully present without being pushed around by experience.</p>

<h2>Beyond Form: The Formless Attainments</h2>

<p>As if four stages weren't enough, the Buddhist tradition describes four additional meditative states beyond the standard dhyanas. These are called the arupa-ayatanas—the "formless bases" or "formless dimensions."</p>

<p>The progression goes like this: infinite space, infinite consciousness, infinite nothingness, and finally neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Each state represents a further abstraction from ordinary experience, moving through successively subtler objects of awareness until even the distinction between perceiving and not-perceiving dissolves.</p>

<p>Some scholars believe these formless attainments weren't originally part of the Buddha's teaching at all. The historian Johannes Bronkhorst argues that while the four dhyanas may have been the Buddha's genuine innovation, the formless states were borrowed from non-Buddhist ascetic traditions—possibly from the very teachers the Buddha studied under before his enlightenment.</p>

<p>If Bronkhorst is right, this represents a fascinating case of religious synthesis. The Buddha would have taken practices already known in his culture and reinterpreted them within a new framework, giving them different meaning and purpose.</p>

<h2>The Deepest State: Cessation</h2>

<p>Beyond even the formless attainments lies something called nirodha samapatti—the "cessation of perception, feelings and consciousness." Some later scholars call it the ninth jhana, though the early texts don't use that terminology.</p>

<p>What happens in this state? According to the fifth-century commentator Buddhaghosa, consciousness and all its associated mental factors are temporarily suppressed. The meditator essentially becomes unconscious—but they're not dead. Life-force and bodily heat remain. They can stay in this state for up to a week.</p>

<p>This might sound like a coma or deep sleep, but practitioners insist it's fundamentally different. Modern neuroscientists have actually begun studying this phenomenon, and some researchers have proposed models for what might be happening in the brain during such states. The question of what consciousness does—or doesn't—during cessation remains one of the more intriguing puzzles at the intersection of contemplative traditions and cognitive science.</p>

<h2>A Debate Spanning Millennia</h2>

<p>Here's where things get interesting—and contentious. The Buddhist tradition contains what appears to be a fundamental tension about how dhyana relates to liberation.</p>

<p>One view emphasizes dhyana as concentration. In this interpretation, the practitioner achieves states of increasingly deep absorption, becoming so focused on a single object that awareness of everything else fades away. This concentrated state provides the stability needed for insight to arise.</p>

<p>Another view emphasizes insight—vipassana—as the key to awakening. From this perspective, what matters is clearly seeing the impermanent, unsatisfactory, and selfless nature of all phenomena. Deep concentration might actually be unnecessary or even counterproductive if it becomes an end in itself.</p>

<p>This tension has shaped the entire history of Buddhist meditation practice. The contemporary Vipassana movement, which has become enormously popular in the West, tends to de-emphasize deep absorption states. Some teachers in this tradition argue that insight can be developed without achieving classical dhyana at all. Others go further, suggesting that getting absorbed in concentrated states might actually distract from the real work of insight.</p>

<p>But since the 1980s, scholars and practitioners have begun questioning this position. They argue that the earliest descriptions of dhyana in the suttas don't actually describe pure concentration. Instead, they describe a progression from investigating body and mind and abandoning unwholesome states to perfected equanimity and watchfulness. The dhyanas, in this reading, aren't about zoning out—they're about waking up.</p>

<h2>What the Buddha Learned—and Unlearned</h2>

<p>The traditional biography of the Buddha includes a revealing detail about his spiritual education. Before his enlightenment, he studied under two renowned teachers: Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. From them, he learned sophisticated meditation techniques that enabled him to achieve the formless attainments.</p>

<p>But these practices, profound as they were, didn't lead to liberation. The Buddha became disillusioned and left these teachers behind, eventually turning to extreme asceticism—which also failed.</p>

<p>Then came the memory of the rose-apple tree.</p>

<p>The scholar Alexander Wynne has argued that the Buddha essentially borrowed the formless meditations from his Brahmanical teachers but radically transformed them. Where these practices originally aimed at something like cosmic union, the Buddha redirected them toward mindfulness and insight. Same techniques, different purpose, utterly different result.</p>

<p>Not everyone accepts this account. Johannes Bronkhorst argues that the story of the Buddha's pre-enlightenment teachers might be largely legendary—a narrative constructed later to explain how certain meditation techniques entered Buddhist practice. The scholar Vishvapani points out that the Brahmanical texts Wynne relies on were composed long after the Buddha's lifetime, making the direction of influence hard to determine.</p>

<p>What does seem clear is that the Buddha's approach involved both accepting and rejecting elements of his cultural inheritance. He worked with available techniques but pointed them toward new goals. This pattern—of synthesis and innovation—would characterize Buddhism throughout its subsequent history.</p>

<h2>The Body as Meditation Object</h2>

<p>There's an aspect of dhyana practice that often gets overlooked in popular discussions: the emphasis on the body. The earliest meditation instructions include contemplation of body parts and their unpleasant aspects, contemplation of the physical elements that compose the body, contemplation of corpse decay, and mindfulness of breathing.</p>

<p>These practices might seem morbid or strange, but they serve a specific purpose. By systematically investigating the body, practitioners break down the unconscious sense that "I am this body" or "this body is mine." The body, examined closely, reveals itself as a collection of processes—not a unified self, but a temporary arrangement of elements following natural laws.</p>

<p>Mindfulness of breathing—anapanasati—became perhaps the most widely practiced of these techniques. It's found in virtually every school of Buddhism, from Theravada monasteries in Southeast Asia to Zen centers in Japan and America. You can trace a direct line from the Buddha's instructions to contemporary mindfulness programs in hospitals and corporate offices.</p>

<p>What makes breath such a powerful meditation object? It's always available. It requires no special equipment or circumstances. It's subtle enough to develop refined attention but gross enough that beginners can work with it. And it sits at the intersection of voluntary and involuntary bodily processes, making it a natural bridge between conscious intention and automatic function.</p>

<h2>Dhyana Across Buddhist Traditions</h2>

<p>As Buddhism spread across Asia, different traditions developed different approaches to dhyana—while all claiming fidelity to the Buddha's original teaching.</p>

<p>The Theravada tradition, dominant in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, preserved detailed commentarial literature on meditation. The Visuddhimagga, or "Path of Purification," written by Buddhaghosa in the fifth century, became the authoritative guide to practice. This tradition tends to emphasize dhyana as concentration and distinguishes it sharply from insight practice.</p>

<p>The Chan tradition in China—which became Zen in Japan and Seon in Korea—took the name "dhyana" as its identity but developed distinctive approaches to practice. Techniques like koan study, where practitioners work with paradoxical questions, don't look much like the concentration exercises described in Theravada texts. Yet Chan practitioners have historically claimed to transmit the authentic meditation tradition of the Buddha himself.</p>

<p>The Tibetan traditions developed their own elaborate systems, including Dzogchen and Mahamudra, which emphasize recognizing the natural state of mind rather than cultivating concentration. Some of these approaches seem closer to the "equanimity and watchfulness" reading of the early dhyana texts than to the concentration interpretation that dominated elsewhere.</p>

<p>These differences aren't just academic. They affect how millions of people actually practice. They determine what teachers teach and what students expect. And they shape the interface between traditional Buddhism and contemporary secular mindfulness.</p>

<h2>The Relationship to Suffering</h2>

<p>The connection between dhyana practice and the Buddhist understanding of suffering runs deep. The Four Noble Truths—that life involves suffering, that suffering has a cause, that suffering can end, and that there's a path to that ending—form the conceptual framework within which meditation makes sense.</p>

<p>But some scholars argue that this framework is actually a later development. Tilmann Vetter has suggested that the Buddha's original liberating experience might have been described simply as "immortality"—a state beyond the reach of death and change—rather than the "cessation of suffering" that became central to later doctrine.</p>

<p>This matters because it affects how we understand what dhyana is supposed to accomplish. Is it primarily therapeutic—a way of reducing psychological suffering? Is it existential—a confrontation with the basic conditions of human existence? Is it metaphysical—a way of accessing some kind of ultimate reality?</p>

<p>Different answers lead to different practices, different expectations, and different measures of success. Someone practicing dhyana to reduce anxiety will have different goals than someone practicing to achieve enlightenment. Whether both are doing "the same thing" depends on questions that Buddhist traditions have been debating for over two thousand years.</p>

<h2>What Dhyana Offers</h2>

<p>Strip away the religious context, and what remains? A set of practices for training attention, developing equanimity, and investigating the nature of mind and experience.</p>

<p>The dhyana tradition offers something increasingly rare in contemporary life: a systematic approach to understanding how your own mind works. Not through theory, but through direct observation. Not as an intellectual exercise, but as a practical skill that can be developed through sustained effort.</p>

<p>Whether the goal is stress reduction, spiritual awakening, or simple curiosity about consciousness, the techniques preserved in the dhyana tradition represent thousands of years of accumulated expertise in working with the mind. They were developed by people who dedicated their entire lives to the project, refined across generations, and transmitted with remarkable fidelity despite massive cultural changes.</p>

<p>The child under the rose-apple tree probably had no idea what he was starting. From that spontaneous childhood experience emerged practices that would shape the spiritual lives of billions of people across thousands of years. The tradition is still evolving, still being debated, still finding new applications in new contexts.</p>

<p>Whatever you make of the metaphysical claims, the practical techniques remain available. The invitation to sit down, pay attention, and discover what happens next has been open for twenty-five centuries. It's still open today.</p>
