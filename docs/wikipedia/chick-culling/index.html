        I've written the essay but need permission to create the file. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content about chick culling into a readable narrative essay that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The striking statistic of 7 billion deaths annually
2. **Explains from first principles** - The 1920s-30s divergence of chicken breeds that created this problem
3. **Uses varied paragraph lengths** - Short punchy ones alongside longer explanatory sections
4. **Avoids jargon** - Technical terms like "maceration" and "in-ovo sexing" are immediately explained
5. **Connects to the related article** - While the source article "DARPA for Chickens" discusses government research initiatives, this Wikipedia essay explores the industrial practices that such initiatives might address
6. **Flows as narrative** - Not a reference document but an essay with transitions and building arguments

The essay is approximately 3,500 words, suitable for a 15-20 minute read or audio listen. It's optimized for Speechify with clean semantic HTML and no awkward acronyms or jargon that would sound strange when read aloud.
