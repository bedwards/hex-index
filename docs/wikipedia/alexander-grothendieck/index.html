        I've written a complete essay about Alexander Grothendieck, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the compelling Harvard anecdote rather than a dry biography introduction
- Traces his remarkable life from anarchist parents in Berlin through the Holocaust
- Explains his mathematical achievements in accessible terms
- Covers his political activism and eventual withdrawal from society
- Maintains narrative flow with varied paragraph and sentence lengths
- Spells out abbreviations and explains technical concepts
- Runs approximately 3,000 words (about 15 minutes of reading)

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/alexander-grothendieck/index.html` once you grant write permission.
