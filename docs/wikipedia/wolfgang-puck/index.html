<p>In 1982, a restaurant opened on the Sunset Strip that would fundamentally change how Americans think about chefs. Before Spago, cooks stayed in the kitchen. They were skilled laborers, essential but invisible, like the mechanics who keep airplanes flying. Wolfgang Puck walked out of that kitchen and became something new: a celebrity chef, a brand, a household name. As one food publication put it, he became "the first (and maybe only) chef you and your grandma know by name."</p>

<p>This was not an obvious path for a boy born Wolfgang Johannes Topfschnig in Sankt Veit an der Glan, a small Austrian town most people have never heard of.</p>

<h2>The Mother Who Cooked</h2>

<p>Puck learned to cook from his mother, who worked as a pastry chef. This detail might seem minor, but it explains a great deal. In the mid-twentieth century, professional cooking was overwhelmingly male, particularly in Europe's grand dining establishments. The brigade system, invented by Auguste Escoffier to organize French restaurant kitchens, was modeled on military hierarchy. It was demanding, sometimes brutal, and almost exclusively masculine.</p>

<p>But pastry work occupied a different world. It required precision rather than improvisation, patience rather than aggression. Learning from a mother who made her living this way meant Puck absorbed cooking not as combat but as craft.</p>

<p>When his mother remarried, young Wolfgang took his stepfather Josef Puck's surname. The marriage also gave him two younger sisters and a younger brother. By the time he was ready to pursue cooking seriously, he was no longer Topfschnig. He was Puck—a name that, coincidentally, sounds exactly like the mischievous sprite from Shakespeare's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>.</p>

<h2>The French Education</h2>

<p>If you wanted to become a serious chef in the 1960s, there was really only one path: French classical training. Puck pursued this education with remarkable thoroughness.</p>

<p>His first major apprenticeship was at L'Oustau de Baumanière in Les Baux-de-Provence, under Raymond Thuilier. This restaurant, set in a medieval village in the south of France, earned three Michelin stars and represented the pinnacle of Provençal cooking. Thuilier himself was an unusual figure—he had been an insurance executive and amateur painter before taking over the restaurant in his fifties and transforming it into a destination.</p>

<p>From there, Puck moved to the Hôtel de Paris in Monaco, the legendary establishment overlooking the Monte Carlo Casino where European royalty and American millionaires had dined for a century. Then Maxim's Paris, perhaps the most famous restaurant in the world, a Belle Époque palace of mirrors and mahogany where the Art Nouveau style had first flourished.</p>

<p>This was not a casual education. These restaurants represented the absolute summit of European fine dining. By the time Puck finished his training, he had absorbed techniques and standards that most American cooks in the early 1970s had only read about.</p>

<h2>Arriving in America</h2>

<p>In 1973, at age twenty-four, Puck moved to the United States. His first position was at La Tour in Indianapolis, Indiana—not exactly the gastronomic capital of America. But after two years, he made the move that would define his career: Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The city that would become synonymous with Wolfgang Puck was, in the mid-1970s, a culinary backwater. New York had its French temples. San Francisco had been developing its own food culture. But Los Angeles? It was a sprawling car city of drive-throughs and diners, a place where the movie industry generated wealth but not much interest in serious cooking.</p>

<p>Puck became chef and part owner of Ma Maison, a restaurant that would begin to change this. The name means "my house" in French, and the restaurant cultivated an informal elegance that appealed to the entertainment industry crowd. Hollywood executives and movie stars started showing up. Puck was building something.</p>

<h2>The Book That Changed Everything</h2>

<p>In 1981, Puck published <em>Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen</em>, based on his Ma Maison recipes. This might seem like a small step—plenty of chefs had written cookbooks before. But the title itself announced a philosophy: this was not simply French cooking transplanted to American soil. It was French technique adapted to American ingredients, American tastes, American possibilities.</p>

<p>The cookbook established Puck as more than a skilled cook. He was now an author, an authority, someone with ideas about food that extended beyond his own kitchen. The following year, he would put those ideas into practice in a way that would reshape American dining.</p>

<h2>Spago and the Birth of California Cuisine</h2>

<p>When Spago opened on the Sunset Strip in 1982, it broke nearly every rule of fine dining.</p>

<p>The food was rooted in French technique but wildly eclectic in its influences. The atmosphere was casual where traditional French restaurants were formal. The kitchen was open, visible to diners, when most restaurants still hid their cooks away like factory workers. And perhaps most iconically, Puck served pizza—not the pizza of Naples or New York, but something entirely new.</p>

<p>His signature dish became smoked salmon pizza: house-smoked salmon on a thin, crispy crust, topped with crème fraîche and caviar. It was simultaneously luxurious and casual, French and Italian and Californian and something else entirely. It became one of the most imitated dishes in American restaurant history.</p>

<p>Spago was serving what would come to be called California cuisine—a style that rejected the rigid categories of European cooking in favor of fresh, local ingredients prepared with whatever techniques seemed most appropriate. Asian influences mixed with French. Italian married Mexican. The only rule was quality and creativity.</p>

<p>The restaurant became the place to be seen in Los Angeles. Oscar night at Spago became an institution. When the Academy Awards ended, the industry's biggest stars headed to the Sunset Strip. Puck, in his chef's whites, would circulate through the dining room, chatting with guests, visible and approachable in a way no great chef had been before.</p>

<h2>The Move to Beverly Hills</h2>

<p>Fifteen years after opening on the Sunset Strip, Puck made a significant decision. In 1997, he and Barbara Lazaroff—his wife, business partner, and the creative force behind the restaurants' distinctive interiors—moved Spago to Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>The relocation was risky. The original Spago had accumulated years of history, of memories, of cultural significance. But Beverly Hills represented a different kind of prestige, a more established affluence. The new location allowed for a larger, more sophisticated space while maintaining the energy and openness that had defined the original.</p>

<p>The gamble paid off. The new Spago has been recognized as one of the top forty restaurants in the United States consistently since 2004. In 2008 and 2009, when the Michelin Guide published Los Angeles editions, Spago Beverly Hills earned two stars—the red guide's indication of cooking worth a detour.</p>

<h2>Building an Empire</h2>

<p>Most great chefs of Puck's generation stayed in one kitchen. They might write cookbooks or train disciples, but their restaurants remained singular, artisanal operations. Puck took a different path.</p>

<p>He expanded. First came Chinois on Main in Santa Monica in 1983, fusing French technique with Asian flavors in ways that now seem prescient but were radical at the time. Then Granita, a seafood restaurant in Malibu that operated from 1991 to 2005. Then restaurants in Las Vegas, where Puck was among the first serious chefs to recognize that the casino city could support fine dining.</p>

<p>His steakhouse concept, CUT, opened in Beverly Hills and eventually spread to Las Vegas, London, New York, Washington D.C., Bahrain, and Singapore. The Singapore location, at the Marina Bay Sands resort, earned a Michelin star in 2016. Spago itself spawned locations in Las Vegas, Budapest, Istanbul, Maui, and Singapore.</p>

<p>This expansion was not universally praised. Purists argued that a chef couldn't maintain quality across dozens of restaurants. How could Wolfgang Puck really be cooking your dinner if there were fifteen restaurants bearing his name?</p>

<p>But Puck was doing something different than simply replicating himself. He was building a system—training chefs, developing recipes, creating standards that could be maintained without his physical presence. He was, in a sense, industrializing fine dining, though that makes it sound more mechanical than it was.</p>

<h2>The Business of Wolfgang Puck</h2>

<p>The corporate structure that emerged tells its own story. Wolfgang Puck Companies operates through three divisions: Wolfgang Puck Fine Dining Group, Wolfgang Puck Catering, and Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, Inc.</p>

<p>The catering arm became perhaps the most visible. Since 1994, Puck has catered the Governors Ball—the official post-ceremony party for the Academy Awards. This is not simply cooking for a banquet. It means feeding over a thousand of Hollywood's most important figures immediately after the most watched awards show on television. The menu is scrutinized, photographed, reported on. It has become as much a part of Oscar night as the red carpet.</p>

<p>Wolfgang Puck Worldwide handles licensed products—the frozen pizzas, the cookware, the coffee makers that bear his name and appear in airport kiosks and shopping malls. This is the part of the business that most offends food purists. How can a serious chef lend his name to products sold next to Cinnabon?</p>

<p>But Puck's answer might be that he was never just a serious chef. He was always building something larger—a brand, certainly, but also a way of bringing good food to more people than could ever fit into Spago.</p>

<h2>The Partnership That Built It</h2>

<p>No account of Wolfgang Puck's success is complete without Barbara Lazaroff.</p>

<p>They married in 1983, a year after Spago opened. Lazaroff was an interior designer, and she brought to the restaurants a visual sensibility that matched Puck's culinary creativity. The open kitchens, the dramatic lighting, the carefully chosen art—these were not afterthoughts. They were essential to the experience, and they were Lazaroff's domain.</p>

<p>She co-founded the restaurants and, even after their divorce in 2003, continued to play a key role in the business. Their sons, Cameron and Byron, grew up in this world of restaurants and entrepreneurship. In late 2023, Cameron's son Maxwell was born, making Wolfgang Puck a grandfather.</p>

<p>The divorce was amicable by the standards of such things. The business partnership survived because both parties recognized that what they had built together was worth preserving, even when the marriage was not.</p>

<h2>The Recognition</h2>

<p>Awards accumulated over the decades like geological strata.</p>

<p>In 1985, Puck received a Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement, presented by Ray Charles. In 1993, the original Spago was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News Fine Dining Hall of Fame. The James Beard Foundation, which functions as something like the Oscars for the American food world, gave Spago its Restaurant of the Year Award in 1994 and an Outstanding Service Award in 2005.</p>

<p>In 2002, Puck won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Service Show—recognition that he had become not just a chef but a television personality. His show, simply called <em>Wolfgang Puck</em>, brought his cooking into American homes.</p>

<p>The Culinary Hall of Fame inducted him in 2013. In 2017, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, that peculiar Los Angeles institution where tourists photograph brass plaques embedded in the sidewalk. His star is located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard, recognizing his work in television.</p>

<p>That same year, the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association named him their Gold Plate Winner. In 2022, the International Hospitality Institute recognized him as one of the hundred most powerful people in global hospitality.</p>

<p>These awards matter not because they measure culinary greatness—such things cannot really be measured—but because they document the remarkable scope of Puck's influence. He has won recognition from restaurant critics, from television academies, from hospitality industry groups, from institutions that honor achievement in general. No other chef has been celebrated so broadly.</p>

<h2>Philanthropy and Giving Back</h2>

<p>In 1982, the same year Spago opened, Puck and Lazaroff co-founded the Puck-Lazaroff Charitable Foundation. Its primary vehicle is the annual American Wine & Food Festival, which benefits Meals on Wheels—the program that delivers food to elderly and homebound Americans who cannot shop or cook for themselves.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the foundation has raised more than fifteen million dollars. This is significant money, enough to make a real difference in the lives of thousands of people who receive meals through the program.</p>

<p>There's something fitting about a chef who built an empire on making food a public celebration using that platform to feed people who cannot celebrate, who are isolated, who depend on others to bring them their meals.</p>

<h2>The Recipes That Traveled</h2>

<p>Since 2003, Puck's recipes have been syndicated worldwide through Tribune Content Agency. This means that newspapers from Los Angeles to London to Sydney can publish his recipes, bringing his approach to cooking into homes far from any of his restaurants.</p>

<p>The cookbooks have continued as well. From <em>Modern French Cooking for the American Kitchen</em> in 1980 through <em>Wolfgang Puck Makes it Healthy</em> in 2017, he has published regularly, adapting his message to changing times. The healthy cooking book represents a different Wolfgang Puck than the one who revolutionized fine dining with smoked salmon pizza—but then, Puck himself was sixty-seven when it was published, perhaps more conscious of nutrition than he had been at thirty-two.</p>

<h2>Personal Life</h2>

<p>Puck has been married three times. His marriage to Barbara Lazaroff lasted twenty years and produced their business partnership, their charitable foundation, and their two sons. After their divorce, Puck married Gelila Assefa in 2007.</p>

<p>Assefa's story is itself remarkable. Born in Ethiopia, she became a model and handbag designer. She was working as a host at Spago when she met Puck—a reminder that even in his own restaurant, life could surprise him.</p>

<p>In 1999, Puck became a United States citizen. He had been in the country for twenty-six years by then, had built an empire, had been celebrated as a pillar of American food culture. The citizenship was perhaps a formality, a legal recognition of something that had long been true in practice. But it also marked a transition: the Austrian apprentice had become an American institution.</p>

<p>His favorite food, reportedly, is macarons—those delicate French cookies made from almond flour and sugar, sandwiched around various fillings. There's something charming about this. A man who revolutionized American fine dining, who built steakhouses and Asian fusion restaurants and pizza palaces, loves best these tiny, precise confections. Perhaps he thinks of his mother, the pastry chef who first taught him to cook.</p>

<h2>The Restaurants That Closed</h2>

<p>Not everything Puck touched succeeded forever. Granita, the Malibu seafood restaurant, closed in 2005 after fourteen years. Five-Sixty in Dallas, which served Asian-inspired New American cuisine from a restaurant at the top of Reunion Tower, closed in April 2020 after eleven years—a victim of the COVID-19 pandemic that devastated the restaurant industry.</p>

<p>The Source in Washington D.C., a modern Asian concept located at the Newseum, also closed in 2020. Wolfgang Puck Steak at the MGM Grand Detroit shut down that same year. Postrio, which had operated in San Francisco from 1989 to 2009, featured what reviewers called "innovative food that draws from a myriad of cultures."</p>

<p>These closures are not failures exactly. They represent the natural lifecycle of restaurants, which are living things that bloom and fade like any organism. A restaurant that lasts fourteen years, or eleven, or twenty, has done something remarkable. Most restaurants close within their first year.</p>

<p>More recently, Ospero in West Hollywood operated from 2021 to 2024. Even as Puck approached his mid-seventies, he was still opening new concepts, still taking risks, still accepting that some experiments would not last.</p>

<h2>What Wolfgang Puck Invented</h2>

<p>It is difficult now to appreciate how thoroughly Wolfgang Puck transformed American dining because so many of his innovations have become standard practice.</p>

<p>The celebrity chef who circulates through the dining room? Puck pioneered it. The open kitchen where diners can watch their food being prepared? Spago was among the first fine dining restaurants to make this the centerpiece of the experience. California cuisine itself—that eclectic, ingredient-driven, category-defying approach to cooking? Puck was one of its primary inventors.</p>

<p>The idea that a serious chef could appear on television, could license products, could build a business empire while maintaining culinary credibility—this was not possible before Wolfgang Puck made it possible. He did not just cook food. He invented a new way for chefs to exist in the world.</p>

<p>Whether this invention was entirely good is a matter of debate. The celebrity chef culture that Puck helped create has produced excess and ego alongside creativity and quality. The licensing arrangements that fund his charitable work also put his name on products he has never touched. Empire-building required compromises that a pure artisan would never make.</p>

<p>But Puck was never a pure artisan. From the beginning—from the moment he walked out of the kitchen at Spago and started greeting his guests like a host rather than a servant—he was doing something new. He was making the chef visible. He was making cooking glamorous. He was, in his way, making America take food seriously.</p>

<h2>The Legacy</h2>

<p>Today, at seventy-six, Wolfgang Puck continues to operate his empire. Spago still serves in Beverly Hills. CUT locations continue worldwide. The catering company still feeds Hollywood on Oscar night. The foundation still raises money for Meals on Wheels.</p>

<p>Young chefs who dream of culinary fame are dreaming a dream that Wolfgang Puck made possible. Before him, the highest aspiration for an American cook was to run one perfect restaurant, perhaps to train apprentices who would carry on traditions. After him, chefs could imagine themselves as brands, as personalities, as businesspeople who happened to make their art in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Is this better? It depends on what you value. The multiplication of Wolfgang Puck means that millions of people have eaten his food—or food bearing his name—who could never have secured a reservation at the original Spago. It also means that the intimate relationship between a single chef and a single dining room has been stretched into something more corporate, more distant, more complicated.</p>

<p>But sitting in judgment of Wolfgang Puck feels somehow beside the point. He changed the world of food. The world of food did not ask his permission, and it cannot take back what he gave it. The Austrian boy who learned to cook from his mother became, improbably but undeniably, the most famous chef in America. That his favorite food remains the macaron—delicate, precise, sweet—suggests that somewhere inside the empire builder, the boy who loved pastry still lives.</p>
