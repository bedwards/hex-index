        The article has been rewritten. Here's what I created:

**Congressional Oversight** - A 2,100+ word essay that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative for text-to-speech reading.

Key improvements:
- **Strong hook**: Opens with the paradox that oversight isn't explicitly in the Constitution
- **Varied structure**: Mix of short punchy paragraphs and longer explanatory sections
- **Narrative flow**: Traces the logic from constitutional silence to implied power to practical machinery
- **Clear explanations**: Concepts like "implied powers," "executive privilege," and "resolutions of inquiry" are explained in plain language
- **Historical depth**: Includes the 1792 Army investigation as precedent, plus Watergate, Church Committee, Iran-Contra
- **Interesting connections**: Links to Mill's philosophy, Madison's Federalist 51, young Wilson's scholarship
- **Contemporary relevance**: Ends with why oversight matters for maintaining constitutional balance

The HTML uses semantic markup optimized for Speechify reading, with proper heading hierarchy and clean paragraph structure.
