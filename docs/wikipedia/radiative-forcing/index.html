        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on radiative forcing. Here's the HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing">Wikipedia: Radiative forcing</a></p>

<p>Imagine you're standing under a blanket on a cold night. The blanket doesn't generate heat—it simply traps the warmth your body already produces. Now imagine someone keeps adding more blankets, one at a time. Each additional layer makes it harder for your body heat to escape, and you get progressively warmer. This, in essence, is what's happening to Earth right now, and the scientific term for measuring how much extra "blanketing" we're adding is called radiative forcing.</p>

<p>Since 1750, human activities have added the equivalent of 2.72 watts of extra heating power for every square meter of Earth's surface. That might sound small—a single LED nightlight uses more power—but multiply it across the entire planet, and you're talking about an enormous amount of trapped energy. Most of this comes from greenhouse gases, though it's partially offset by aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere) that actually reflect some sunlight back into space.</p>

<h2>The Energy Checkbook</h2>

<p>Earth operates like a cosmic checking account. Energy flows in from the sun, and energy flows back out into space as infrared radiation—what we experience as heat. When these two flows balance, Earth maintains a stable temperature. Scientists call this radiative equilibrium.</p>

<p>But here's the thing: that balance is delicate.</p>

<p>Any factor that changes how much energy comes in or goes out creates what scientists call a forcing. Add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere? That's a positive forcing—Earth retains more heat. Inject volcanic ash into the stratosphere? That's a negative forcing—more sunlight gets reflected before it can warm the surface. The Indonesian volcano Tambora, which erupted in 1815, caused "the year without a summer" in 1816, with widespread crop failures across Europe and North America. That's radiative forcing in dramatic action.</p>

<p>The opposite of radiative forcing isn't really a single phenomenon—it's equilibrium, the state where incoming and outgoing energy perfectly match. Think of it as the climate system at rest, neither warming nor cooling over time.</p>

<h2>Why Watts Per Square Meter?</h2>

<p>Scientists express radiative forcing in watts per square meter (W/m²). This unit might seem arbitrary, but it's brilliantly practical. By standardizing the measurement to a unit area, researchers can directly compare wildly different phenomena. How does carbon dioxide's warming effect stack up against methane's? How does deforestation compare to increased solar output? The W/m² framework lets scientists add up these disparate influences like items on a grocery receipt.</p>

<p>It's worth pausing to appreciate something unusual here: radiative forcing isn't something you can directly measure with an instrument. You can't point a "forcing meter" at the sky and get a reading. Instead, scientists calculate it from more fundamental physics—the absorption properties of different gases, satellite measurements of Earth's energy balance, and sophisticated computer models of atmospheric behavior. The concept is real, even if it requires indirect observation.</p>

<h2>The Logarithmic Twist</h2>

<p>One of the most counterintuitive aspects of greenhouse gas forcing involves carbon dioxide's relationship to warming. It's not linear—it's logarithmic.</p>

<p>What does that mean in practice? The first hundred parts per million of CO₂ added to an atmosphere have a bigger warming effect than the next hundred, which have a bigger effect than the hundred after that. Think of painting a window with increasingly opaque paint: the first coat blocks the most light, while subsequent coats block progressively less because there's less light left to block.</p>

<p>This might sound like good news—and in a narrow sense, it is. We're not facing runaway exponential warming from each additional ton of CO₂. But there's a catch: we're adding CO₂ so fast that the diminishing returns barely matter. We've already increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by 50 percent since 1750, from 278 parts per million to around 420 today. That corresponds to roughly 2.17 W/m² of additional forcing. If we double pre-industrial levels—which current trajectories suggest could happen within decades—we'll add about 3.71 W/m² total.</p>

<p>The logarithmic relationship holds up to about eight times pre-industrial concentrations. After that, the physics gets more complicated. But let's hope we never have to worry about those calculations.</p>

<h2>Not All Forcings Are Created Equal</h2>

<p>Scientists distinguish between different types of radiative forcing, and the distinctions matter more than you might think.</p>

<p>The simplest version is instantaneous radiative forcing—the immediate change in Earth's energy balance when you alter something like greenhouse gas concentrations. But the atmosphere doesn't just passively accept changes. It responds. The stratosphere (the layer of atmosphere between roughly 10 and 50 kilometers up) warms or cools in response to forcing changes, and this adjustment itself affects how much energy escapes to space.</p>

<p>When scientists account for stratospheric adjustment, they call the result stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing. This is a more accurate picture of what's actually happening to Earth's energy budget.</p>

<p>But wait—there's more. The lower atmosphere (the troposphere, where weather happens and where we live) also adjusts rapidly to forcing changes. Clouds form differently. Water vapor redistributes. Land surfaces warm. When scientists account for all these rapid adjustments, they get effective radiative forcing, or ERF. This is the current gold standard for comparing different climate drivers because it captures how the atmosphere actually responds in the real world.</p>

<p>The difference matters. Some forcing agents, like certain aerosols, have very different instantaneous and effective forcings because they trigger strong atmospheric adjustments. Using instantaneous forcing for these agents would give a misleading picture of their actual climate impact.</p>

<h2>The Cast of Characters</h2>

<p>Five gases account for about 96 percent of the direct radiative forcing from long-lived greenhouse gases since 1750: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. The remaining 4 percent comes from fifteen minor halogenated gases—compounds containing chlorine, fluorine, or bromine atoms.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide dominates the conversation, and for good reason. It's responsible for the largest share of forcing, and unlike water vapor (which cycles through the atmosphere in days), CO₂ persists for centuries. A molecule of carbon dioxide released today will still be trapping heat when your great-great-grandchildren are alive.</p>

<p>Methane punches above its weight. Molecule for molecule, it's far more effective at trapping heat than CO₂—about 80 times more effective over a 20-year period. But methane breaks down in the atmosphere within about a decade, so its long-term accumulation is limited. This actually makes methane reduction a lever for relatively quick climate wins: cut methane emissions today, and you'll see atmospheric benefits within years rather than centuries.</p>

<p>Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, offer a fascinating case study. These industrial chemicals were phased out under the Montreal Protocol of 1987 because they destroy stratospheric ozone—the ozone layer that protects us from ultraviolet radiation. But CFCs are also potent greenhouse gases. By eliminating them for ozone protection, we accidentally delivered a significant climate benefit. The Montreal Protocol may be the most successful environmental treaty in history, and its climate dividends weren't even its primary goal.</p>

<h2>The Aerosol Complication</h2>

<p>Here's an uncomfortable truth: some air pollution is actually cooling the planet.</p>

<p>Aerosols—tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere—can have either warming or cooling effects depending on their composition. Sulfate aerosols, produced mainly by burning coal, reflect incoming sunlight and cool the surface. Black carbon (soot) absorbs sunlight and warms things up. On balance, aerosols have been masking some of the warming from greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>This creates a perverse situation. As countries clean up their air pollution (for excellent reasons related to human health), they remove some of the cooling aerosols, and the full warming effect of greenhouse gases becomes apparent. Between 2003 and 2018, about 20 percent of the observed increase in radiative forcing came from reduced aerosol concentrations. We were uncovering warming that had been hidden all along.</p>

<p>Some climate scientists have explored the idea of deliberately injecting aerosols into the stratosphere to offset greenhouse warming—a concept called solar radiation management or stratospheric aerosol injection. It's controversial. The particles would need continuous replenishment, stopping the program would trigger rapid warming as the masking effect disappeared, and the effects would be distributed unevenly around the globe. It's a bit like suggesting we keep smoking because quitting might cause weight gain.</p>

<h2>Measuring the Invisible</h2>

<p>Since 1998, NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments have been watching Earth's energy balance from orbit. Every scan of the globe provides a snapshot of how much energy is coming in and going out. It's like having a cosmic accountant constantly checking the books.</p>

<p>The raw data is messy. Natural fluctuations—seasonal changes, El Niño events, volcanic eruptions—create constant noise. The challenge is extracting the human signal from this natural variability.</p>

<p>Researchers have developed sophisticated techniques to separate the components. They use additional satellite instruments to measure temperature, clouds, and atmospheric composition, then mathematically remove the effects of natural variations and climate feedbacks. What remains is the anthropogenic trend—the part caused by human activities.</p>

<p>The results are sobering. Between 2003 and 2018, radiative forcing increased by 0.53 W/m² (plus or minus 0.11 W/m²). That's about 20 percent of the total forcing accumulated since 1750, concentrated into just 15 years. The majority came from rising greenhouse gas concentrations, with the rest from declining aerosol pollution.</p>

<p>Ground-based measurements tell a consistent story. Two sites in Oklahoma and Alaska, operating under clear-sky conditions, detected the warming effect of rising CO₂ on the infrared radiation reaching the surface. Between 2000 and 2010, this surface-level forcing increased by about 0.2 W/m² per decade—smaller than the top-of-atmosphere values because the atmosphere absorbs some of the radiation before it reaches the ground, but unmistakably rising.</p>

<h2>From Forcing to Temperature</h2>

<p>Radiative forcing tells us how much extra energy is entering the climate system. But what we really want to know is: how much will temperatures rise?</p>

<p>The connection involves a quantity called climate sensitivity—how much global temperature changes for a given amount of forcing. Scientists typically express this as the temperature change expected from a doubling of atmospheric CO₂. Current estimates cluster around 3°C (5.4°F), though uncertainty ranges from about 2.5°C to 4°C.</p>

<p>The math is deceptively simple. Multiply the forcing by the climate sensitivity parameter (roughly 0.8 degrees per watt per square meter), and you get the expected temperature change. The 2.0 W/m² of forcing from CO₂ increases since 1750 predicts about 1.6°C of warming—remarkably close to what we've actually observed.</p>

<p>But this simplicity masks enormous complexity. The climate sensitivity parameter isn't constant—it changes depending on the initial state of the climate, the type of forcing, and the timescale considered. Different forcings trigger different feedback mechanisms. And the real climate system includes chaos, tipping points, and nonlinear dynamics that simple equations can't capture.</p>

<p>Radiative forcing works best for well-mixed, long-lived greenhouse gases like CO₂. For other forcing agents—soot particles, land use changes, localized pollution—the relationship between forcing and temperature is messier. These agents affect the climate in ways that don't map cleanly onto the global average framework.</p>

<h2>The Historical Development</h2>

<p>The concept of radiative forcing has its roots in early 20th century physics. Scientists studying stellar atmospheres developed the mathematics of radiative transfer—how energy moves through material that can absorb and emit radiation. By mid-century, they were applying these tools to Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The key insight came from studying what physicists call radiative-convective equilibrium. Earth's atmosphere isn't just about radiation; it also moves heat through convection (warm air rising, cool air sinking). Models incorporating both mechanisms could explain Earth's observed temperature profile far better than radiation-only approaches.</p>

<p>These models revealed something powerful: you could simulate a perturbation—adding greenhouse gases, changing solar output, inserting volcanic aerosols—and calculate how the system would respond. The forcing-feedback framework emerged. An external forcing pushes the system out of balance; feedbacks (some amplifying, some dampening) determine how much temperature ultimately changes; eventually, a new equilibrium emerges.</p>

<p>By the 1980s, radiative forcing had become the standard language for discussing climate change. The term appears throughout the scientific literature, in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, and in policy discussions. It provides a common currency for comparing diverse climate influences.</p>

<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

<p>Understanding radiative forcing helps clarify what's actually happening to our planet. We're not facing some mysterious warming driven by unknown forces. We can calculate, from basic physics, how much additional energy our greenhouse gas emissions are trapping. We can verify these calculations against satellite observations. We can track changes year by year.</p>

<p>The numbers tell a stark story. Human activities have pushed Earth's energy balance out of equilibrium by nearly 3 watts per square meter. That imbalance is growing, not shrinking. The physics doesn't care about politics or economics—it just keeps accumulating heat.</p>

<p>But the physics also points toward solutions. If we can reduce the forcing, we reduce the warming. The logarithmic relationship means that the first tons of emissions we cut deliver the biggest benefits. The methane opportunity—a gas with strong forcing but short atmospheric lifetime—offers a path to relatively quick results.</p>

<p>Radiative forcing isn't just an abstract scientific concept. It's the accounting system for humanity's largest experiment: what happens when you change the energy balance of an entire planet.</p>
