<h2>The Plan That Wasn't Written in Spanish</h2>

<p>Here's a detail that tells you everything about how American foreign policy actually works: when Colombia's government finally received the official document outlining a multi-billion dollar initiative to transform their country, it was written in English. The Spanish translation wouldn't arrive until months later, after the English version had already been revised. The Colombians were, in effect, reading their own national strategy as a foreign text.</p>

<p>This was Plan Colombia—a sprawling American intervention launched in 2000 that would eventually funnel roughly ten billion dollars into a South American nation roughly the size of Texas and California combined. It was sold to the American public as a drug war. It was sold to Europeans as a humanitarian project. And it was sold to Colombian peasants as something else entirely, though they never had much say in the matter.</p>

<h2>The Marshall Plan That Never Was</h2>

<p>The story begins with Andrés Pastrana Arango, who won Colombia's presidency in 1998 with an audacious vision. Just days after the first round of elections, he stood before an audience at Bogotá's Tequendama Hotel and proposed what he called a "Marshall Plan for Colombia"—a reference to the American program that rebuilt Western Europe after World War Two.</p>

<p>Pastrana understood something fundamental about his country's cocaine problem. Drug crops weren't just an agricultural nuisance. They were a symptom of deeper failures.</p>

<blockquote>Drug crops are a social problem whose solution must pass through the solution to the armed conflict. Developed countries should help us to implement some sort of 'Marshall Plan' for Colombia, which will allow us to develop great investments in the social field, in order to offer our peasants different alternatives to the illicit crops.</blockquote>

<p>This original vision emphasized social development. Manual eradication of drug crops. Peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, which had been fighting the government since 1964. Early drafts called for roughly fifty-five percent military aid and forty-five percent developmental assistance. The focus was ending violence, not waging new wars.</p>

<p>Then Washington got involved.</p>

<h2>How a Peace Plan Became a War Plan</h2>

<p>The transformation happened gradually, through diplomatic channels and bureaucratic revisions. President Pastrana met with Bill Clinton in August 1998 to discuss American aid. The conversations continued through 1999. And somewhere in those meetings—in those air-conditioned rooms where diplomats speak in euphemisms—the nature of the plan shifted dramatically.</p>

<p>Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering suggested that America could commit to three years of aid rather than annual packages. This was significant money, requiring significant American input. And that input came with conditions.</p>

<p>The final version that emerged bore little resemblance to Pastrana's original vision. Where he had emphasized peace negotiations and social development, the American-approved plan focused on drug trafficking and military strengthening. In the US Senate debates over the plan, Senator Joseph Biden emerged as a leading advocate for the harder-line approach.</p>

<p>Ambassador Robert White, a veteran American diplomat, was blunt about what had happened:</p>

<blockquote>If you read the original Plan Colombia, not the one that was written in Washington but the original Plan Colombia, there's no mention of military drives against the FARC rebels. Quite the contrary. President Pastrana says the FARC is part of the history of Colombia and a historical phenomenon, and they must be treated as Colombians. Colombians come and ask for bread and you give them stones.</blockquote>

<h2>Following the Money</h2>

<p>The numbers tell the story more clearly than any diplomatic cables could.</p>

<p>In the year 2000 alone, seventy-eight percent of American funds went directly to the Colombian military and police for counternarcotics and military operations. Not social programs. Not economic development. Not education or healthcare. Weapons, training, helicopters, and intelligence assistance.</p>

<p>Pastrana defended this by pointing out that American money was only seventeen percent of the total projected Plan Colombia budget. The rest—focused on social development—would supposedly come from Europe, Japan, Canada, Latin America, and Colombia itself. The original plan called for seven and a half billion dollars total, with over half dedicated to institutional and social development.</p>

<p>The problem was that those other donors never fully materialized. European countries looked at the American military emphasis and balked. They donated approximately one hundred twenty-eight million dollars in the first year—just over two percent of the total. Larger contributions came through other channels, but European governments were careful to specify that their aid was not technically part of Plan Colombia. They wanted distance from what they saw as a military adventure dressed in humanitarian clothing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Colombia's own economic crisis from 1999 to 2001 meant they couldn't contribute their promised share either.</p>

<p>The result was a plan that looked nothing like its original design. The social development funding largely evaporated. The military funding remained.</p>

<h2>The War on Drugs Comes to the Andes</h2>

<p>To understand Plan Colombia, you need to understand the broader American approach to drugs that began under President Richard Nixon in 1971. Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" and launched what he called a "war on drugs"—a metaphor that would shape American policy for decades.</p>

<p>The logic seemed straightforward: if you could stop drugs at their source, you could solve the problem of addiction at home. Destroy the coca fields in Colombia, and cocaine wouldn't reach American cities. This is called "supply-side" drug policy, and it has a certain intuitive appeal.</p>

<p>The problem is that economists had been skeptical of this approach for years.</p>

<p>In 1988, the RAND Corporation—a prestigious American think tank—released a hundred seventy-five page study funded by the Defense Department itself. The researchers, including seven economists and mathematicians, concluded that using armed forces to interdict drugs would have "minimal or no effect" on cocaine traffic. Worse, it might actually increase profits for cocaine cartels by raising prices. Seven previous studies over nine years had reached similar conclusions.</p>

<p>The RAND researchers conducted another major study in the early 1990s, this time for the Clinton administration. Their conclusion was even more striking: three billion dollars should be shifted from law enforcement to drug treatment. Treatment, they found, was simply the cheapest way to reduce drug use.</p>

<p>Clinton's drug policy director rejected the recommendation. The war on drugs continued.</p>

<h2>What Plan Colombia Actually Did</h2>

<p>The plan authorized five hundred American military personnel to train Colombian forces, plus three hundred civilians to assist in coca eradication. This made Colombia the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid, behind only Israel and Egypt—a remarkable status for a country most Americans couldn't locate on a map.</p>

<p>The centerpiece of the eradication effort was aerial spraying. Small planes would fly over coca fields, releasing herbicides that killed the drug crops. Supporters in Congress claimed that over thirteen hundred square kilometers of mature coca were sprayed and destroyed in 2003 alone, preventing the production of more than five hundred metric tons of cocaine.</p>

<p>But did it work?</p>

<p>This is where the story gets murky. American government reports claimed cocaine production in Colombia dropped seventy-two percent between 2001 and 2012. United Nations sources found no change at all. These contradictions were never fully resolved.</p>

<p>What's clear is that coca cultivation is remarkably resilient. Farmers whose fields are destroyed simply move elsewhere and replant. This phenomenon—sometimes called the "balloon effect"—means that pressure in one area just pushes production to another. Spray coca fields in southern Colombia, and cultivation shifts to the north. Crack down in Colombia entirely, and production moves to Peru or Bolivia.</p>

<p>Some critics argued that the entire supply-side approach was fundamentally misguided. As long as Americans wanted to buy cocaine, someone would find a way to grow and sell it. The US Congress considered amendments to the Andean initiative that would have redirected money toward demand reduction—primarily drug treatment services in American cities. These amendments were rejected.</p>

<h2>The FARC and the War Within the War</h2>

<p>The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia had been fighting the Colombian government since 1964—one of the longest-running insurgencies in modern history. By the time Plan Colombia launched, the FARC controlled vast swaths of rural territory and funded their operations significantly through the cocaine trade.</p>

<p>This created a convenient overlap for American policymakers. Fighting drug trafficking meant fighting the FARC. Fighting the FARC meant fighting drug trafficking. The two goals became effectively inseparable, even if they weren't always presented that way.</p>

<p>After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, this connection intensified. The Andean Regional Initiative appropriated six hundred seventy-six million dollars for South American countries, with three hundred eighty million targeted at Colombia. The 2001 initiative loosened restrictions on civilian contractors, allowing them to carry military weapons during spray missions.</p>

<p>In October 2004, Congress doubled the number of American military advisors allowed in Colombia from four hundred to eight hundred, and increased private contractors from four hundred to six hundred.</p>

<p>President George W. Bush visited Cartagena in November 2004 and declared his support for continuing Plan Colombia aid. He described the initiative as enjoying "wide bipartisan support"—which was true. Democrats and Republicans disagreed about many things, but funding the Colombian military wasn't one of them.</p>

<p>Bush articulated his vision as a "three-legged stool": waging global war on terror, supporting democracy, and reducing drug flow into the United States. Critics saw something simpler—a counterinsurgency program dressed in anti-drug clothing.</p>

<h2>The Hidden Stakes</h2>

<p>Some observers pointed to motivations beyond drugs and guerrillas. By 2004, Colombia was the fifteenth-largest supplier of oil to the United States. Between 1986 and 1997, FARC attacks on pipelines had spilled nearly seventy-nine million barrels of crude oil, causing an estimated one and a half billion dollars in damage and devastating local ecosystems.</p>

<p>A more secure Colombia meant more secure oil production. Authors like Doug Stokes and Francisco Ramirez Cuellar argued that the real targets of Plan Colombia weren't drug traffickers but peasant movements calling for social reform—movements that threatened international plans to exploit Colombia's natural resources.</p>

<p>This interpretation may be too cynical. It may also be too generous. Foreign policy rarely has single motivations. Drug trafficking, insurgency, terrorism, oil, and regional stability all overlapped in ways that made them difficult to disentangle. American policymakers could pursue all these goals simultaneously without necessarily lying about any single one.</p>

<h2>The Long Aftermath</h2>

<p>Plan Colombia in its original form continued until 2015—fifteen years of American military aid, aerial spraying, and counterinsurgency support. By most measures, the FARC lost significant power against the Colombian government. Whether this was due to Plan Colombia specifically or broader factors remains debated.</p>

<p>The cocaine question proved more intractable. Despite billions spent on eradication, cocaine continued flowing north. American demand remained steady. New trafficking routes emerged through Central America and the Caribbean. Bodies began washing up on beaches in Trinidad.</p>

<p>In 2016, the Colombian government and the FARC signed a peace agreement—the kind of negotiated settlement that Pastrana had originally envisioned back in 1998, before his plan was rewritten in Washington. The American response was a new program called "Peace Colombia," intended to help the country rebuild after half a century of war.</p>

<p>Whether Peace Colombia would avoid the fate of its predecessor—becoming a military program with a humanitarian name—remained to be seen.</p>

<h2>What It All Means</h2>

<p>Plan Colombia reveals something about how American foreign policy actually operates. Grand strategies announced in Washington often bear little resemblance to what happens on the ground. Programs sold as humanitarian aid become military operations. Initiatives named for peace fund war.</p>

<p>The Colombian people—especially the rural poor who lived among the coca fields—had limited say in any of this. They experienced Plan Colombia not as a policy debate but as helicopters overhead, herbicides destroying their crops, and armed men in their villages. Whether those armed men wore government uniforms or guerrilla fatigues mattered less than the simple fact of their presence.</p>

<p>Ten billion dollars over fifteen years. That's what America spent trying to solve Colombia's cocaine problem by fighting it at the source. The economists who said treatment would work better never got their three billion. The peasants who were promised a Marshall Plan got military aid instead.</p>

<p>And the drugs kept flowing north.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the most important lesson of Plan Colombia: the gap between what policies are called and what they actually do. A plan for peace became a plan for war. A drug eradication program became a counterinsurgency campaign. And a document about Colombia's future was written, first and most importantly, in English.</p>
