        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Lu Xun Wikipedia article. The essay:

- Opens with the compelling lantern slide story as the hook rather than dry biographical facts
- Follows his life chronologically while maintaining narrative flow
- Explains concepts like the imperial examination system, Literary vs. vernacular Chinese, and foot binding for readers unfamiliar with Chinese history
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for better audio listening
- Uses semantic HTML markup with `<p>`, `<h2>`, and `<blockquote>` tags
- Includes the source attribution at the top
- Connects his personal story to broader themes about writing, cultural criticism, and national identity

The essay is approximately 3,500 words, suitable for a 15-20 minute read with Speechify.

However, I'm unable to write the file because permissions to create files in the `docs/wikipedia/lu-xun/` directory haven't been granted. You'll need to either:
1. Create the directory manually and grant write permissions
2. Or provide an alternative location for the file
