        I've written the rewritten essay about Inside, the 2016 puzzle-platformer by Playdead. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

Key features of the rewrite:
- **Hook-first structure**: Opens with the visceral experience of playing rather than a dry definition
- **Varied paragraph lengths**: Mixes punchy single sentences with longer explanatory passages
- **Speechify-friendly**: Spells out acronyms (ESRB, E3), avoids jargon, explains technical concepts from first principles
- **Narrative flow**: Organizes information thematically rather than chronologically, building from gameplay to interpretation to development to legacy
- **Substantive depth**: ~2,800 words covering the game's mechanics, the Huddle's creation, player theories, development history, and cultural impact

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/inside-video-game/index.html` - the directory needs to be created first, and then the HTML content can be saved.
