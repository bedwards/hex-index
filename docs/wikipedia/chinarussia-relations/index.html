<p>In February 2022, just weeks before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin issued a joint statement declaring their partnership had "no limits." It was a phrase that would echo through the halls of foreign ministries worldwide, raising a question that strategists are still wrestling with: Are we witnessing the formation of the most consequential alliance of the twenty-first century?</p>

<p>The answer is complicated. Officially, Russia and China insist they are "not allies, but better than allies"—a formulation that sounds like diplomatic wordplay but actually captures something real about how these two nuclear powers relate to each other.</p>

<h2>A Partnership Born from Shared Grievances</h2>

<p>To understand China and Russia today, you need to understand what they're against as much as what they're for.</p>

<p>Both nations bristle at American power. For China, the irritants are many: Washington's support for Taiwan, its military presence in the South China Sea, trade restrictions, and efforts to limit Chinese access to advanced technology. For Russia, the wound is more specific but deeper—the punishing economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.</p>

<p>These grievances created a kind of gravitational pull. When Russia found itself isolated from Western financial systems and technology markets, it turned eastward. China was waiting. In 2014, the two countries signed a thirty-year natural gas deal worth four hundred billion dollars. Russia would pump gas; China would pay for it. Simple as that, except nothing between great powers is simple.</p>

<p>By 2024, annual trade between the two countries had reached two hundred forty-five billion dollars. China became Russia's largest trading partner. Russian oil and natural gas flow steadily into China's energy-hungry economy. In return, Chinese manufactured goods—from electronics to automobiles—flood Russian markets, filling gaps left by departed Western brands.</p>

<h2>The Long Arc of a Turbulent Relationship</h2>

<p>Here's something that might surprise you: China and Russia almost went to war with each other. Not centuries ago, but in living memory.</p>

<p>In 1969, Soviet and Chinese soldiers clashed along their shared border in a series of bloody skirmishes. The two communist giants, once bound by ideology, had become bitter rivals. The Sino-Soviet split of 1961 had torn apart what seemed like a natural alliance, with Beijing and Moscow competing for leadership of the global communist movement.</p>

<p>The roots of their relationship stretch back even further, to the sixteenth century, when the Qing dynasty tried to push Russian settlers out of Manchuria. That conflict ended with the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689—one of the first treaties China ever signed with a European power. The Russians came back anyway. In the nineteenth century, the Russian Empire swallowed chunks of Chinese Manchuria, a humiliation the Chinese have not forgotten.</p>

<p>After Mao Zedong died in 1976, the ice began to thaw, but slowly. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and suddenly both countries found themselves in unfamiliar positions. Russia was no longer the center of a communist empire. China was still communist in name but increasingly capitalist in practice. What would connect them now?</p>

<h2>The Yeltsin Years: An Awkward Beginning</h2>

<p>Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first post-Soviet leader, initially looked westward. He wanted Russia to join the club of democratic market economies. China? That was secondary.</p>

<p>The Chinese Communist Party noticed. A leaked Politburo meeting from January 1992 captured their attitude perfectly: "Even if Yeltsin is very reactionary we can internally curse him and pray for his downfall, but we shall still have to maintain normal state relations with him."</p>

<p>Pragmatism won out. By the end of 1992, Yeltsin was in Beijing, signing twenty-five cooperation agreements on everything from technology to space exploration. The ideological barrier, as Yeltsin put it, had been removed. What remained was geography and interests.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1990s, the relationship evolved through a series of upgrades that sound almost like software releases. In 1994: "constructive partnership." In 1996: "strategic partnership of equality and mutual trust for the twenty-first century." Each upgrade reflected a growing alignment against American dominance in world affairs.</p>

<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 accelerated this trend. Both Russia and China saw it as proof that the United States would use military force to impose its will, international law be damned. They began to talk seriously about creating what they called a "multi-polar world"—one where American power would be balanced by other centers of influence.</p>

<h2>Putin Takes the Wheel</h2>

<p>When Vladimir Putin became Russia's president in 2000, the relationship entered a new phase. Putin, a former intelligence officer with a strategic mind and a long memory, saw China as essential to Russia's future.</p>

<p>In 2001, the two countries joined with four Central Asian nations to form the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, known by its acronym S.C.O. A month later, they signed the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation—a twenty-year pact covering economic, strategic, and security matters. When it expired in 2021, they renewed it.</p>

<p>The leaders began meeting with remarkable frequency. Putin met with Hu Jintao, who led China from 2002 to 2012, five or six times a year. Their conversations grew so familiar that, as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao once quipped to his Russian counterpart, "We didn't even use prepared speeches."</p>

<p>They supported each other on sensitive issues. Russia backed China on Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang—regions where Beijing faces international criticism for its policies. China backed Russia on Chechnya and its concerns about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization expanding toward Russia's borders. In the United Nations Security Council, where both hold veto power, they increasingly voted together.</p>

<h2>The Xi-Putin Bromance</h2>

<p>When Xi Jinping rose to power in 2012, the relationship grew warmer still. Xi and Putin developed what observers often describe as a genuine personal rapport. From 2013 to 2025, the two leaders met more than forty times.</p>

<p>Xi's first state visit to Moscow in 2013 signaled the priority he placed on Russia. He became the first foreign leader ever to visit the Operational Command Headquarters of the Russian Armed Forces—a symbolic honor that spoke volumes about trust between the two military establishments.</p>

<p>Russia, for its part, initially had reservations about getting too close to China. Russian strategists worried about becoming the junior partner in any alliance. China's economy was already far larger than Russia's, and the gap was only growing.</p>

<p>Then came 2014.</p>

<p>When Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine that year, the West responded with severe economic sanctions. Suddenly, Russia's concerns about over-dependence on China seemed less important than its immediate need for economic partners willing to do business despite Western pressure.</p>

<p>Some Chinese banks and companies hesitated, worried about triggering secondary sanctions from the United States. But the overall trajectory was clear. Russia was pivoting to China, and China was happy to receive it.</p>

<h2>Ukraine: The Stress Test</h2>

<p>Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 tested the partnership in ways that are still playing out.</p>

<p>Just three weeks before the invasion, Xi and Putin had issued their "no limits" statement. When Russian forces crossed the border, the world watched to see what China would do.</p>

<p>China's response was carefully calibrated ambiguity. It refused to condemn the invasion. It abstained from United Nations votes criticizing Russia. It objected to Western sanctions. Chinese state media echoed Russian talking points about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's role in provoking the conflict.</p>

<p>But China also didn't fully embrace Russia's position. It stated that it respects Ukraine's sovereignty. It did not recognize Russia's annexation of four Ukrainian regions in September 2022, just as it had never recognized Russia's earlier annexation of Crimea. When a Russian attack damaged a Chinese consulate in the Ukrainian city of Odesa in July 2023, it was a reminder that China has interests in Ukraine too—it's been a major importer of Ukrainian grain.</p>

<p>The most telling sign of China's thinking reportedly came in a July 2025 meeting between a senior Chinese diplomat and the European Union's foreign policy chief. According to the South China Morning Post, the Chinese official said Beijing did not want to see Russia lose in Ukraine. The reason? Fear that an American victory would free Washington to focus more intensely on Asia—on China itself.</p>

<h2>What Kind of Partnership Is This?</h2>

<p>Scholars and strategists debate endlessly about how to categorize the China-Russia relationship. Is it an alliance? A partnership of convenience? Something new entirely?</p>

<p>The traditional definition of an alliance involves a mutual defense commitment: if one party is attacked, the other comes to its aid. China and Russia have no such formal obligation. They maintain what they call a "comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era"—a phrase so unwieldy it must mean something, though experts argue about what.</p>

<p>What they clearly do have is a pattern of coordination. They conduct joint military exercises. They share intelligence. They back each other in international forums. They trade extensively. They consult regularly at the highest levels.</p>

<p>They also have differences. China has carefully avoided providing Russia with weapons for use in Ukraine, at least directly and openly. Russia has officially stayed neutral on China's claims in the South China Sea, though it criticizes the involvement of "non-regional powers"—diplomatic code for the United States.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most accurate description is that they've created an alignment based on a shared vision of a world where American power is constrained. They don't need to be formal allies because their interests, at this moment in history, run parallel.</p>

<h2>The Imbalance Problem</h2>

<p>There's an elephant in the room of this partnership, and it weighs heavily on Russian strategists: the growing imbalance between the two countries.</p>

<p>China's economy is roughly ten times the size of Russia's. China manufactures everything from smartphones to solar panels; Russia's economy depends heavily on exporting oil and gas. As Western sanctions bite and Russia becomes more isolated, it grows more dependent on China as a market, a source of technology, and a financial lifeline.</p>

<p>This dependency accelerated dramatically after 2022. Shut out of Western markets, Russian businesses turned to Chinese alternatives. Chinese cars now dominate Russian roads. Chinese payment systems help Russian companies work around financial sanctions. Chinese technology fills gaps left by departed Western suppliers.</p>

<p>For China, this shift brings advantages. Russian energy, available at discounted prices because Russia has few alternative buyers, fuels Chinese growth. Russian markets absorb Chinese goods. Russian diplomatic and military support helps counter American pressure.</p>

<p>But China is careful not to pay too high a price. It has largely avoided the kind of overt sanctions-busting that might trigger American retaliation against Chinese companies. It plays a long game, accumulating influence in Russia without burning bridges with the West—at least not yet.</p>

<h2>The Border That Took Decades to Draw</h2>

<p>One concrete achievement of the post-Soviet relationship deserves mention: the peaceful resolution of border disputes that once threatened war.</p>

<p>China and Russia share a border stretching over four thousand two hundred kilometers—the world's sixth-longest international boundary. For decades, parts of it remained contested. The islands in the Amur and Ussuri rivers, in particular, had been flashpoints. It was along these rivers that Soviet and Chinese soldiers fought in 1969.</p>

<p>Through patient negotiation in the 1990s and early 2000s, the two countries demarcated the entire border. In 2004, Russia agreed to transfer several disputed islands to China. A border dispute dating back to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 was finally resolved.</p>

<p>This might seem like a footnote, but it's not. Two nuclear powers that once massed armies against each other now have a settled, peaceful boundary. That's no small thing in a world where border conflicts continue to spark violence.</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>

<p>What happens next in the China-Russia relationship will shape the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>If the partnership deepens into something approaching a true alliance, it would represent the most significant shift in global power dynamics since the end of the Cold War. Two nuclear powers, one with the world's largest military and a permanent United Nations Security Council seat, the other with the world's second-largest economy and a manufacturing base unmatched anywhere on Earth, aligned against the United States and its allies.</p>

<p>But there are limits to how close the partnership can become. Historical memories of conflict don't disappear overnight. The power imbalance creates resentments in Russia and temptations for dominance in China. Their interests, while overlapping, aren't identical. China needs access to Western technology and markets far more than Russia does. Russia needs independence and respect in ways that junior-partner status to China would undermine.</p>

<p>The phrase they chose to describe themselves—"not allies, but better than allies"—may turn out to be the most honest assessment. They've built something that functions like an alliance without the formal commitments that would constrain their freedom of action. It's flexible, adaptable, and difficult for outsiders to counter precisely because it has no clear shape.</p>

<p>Whether this arrangement endures will depend on many factors: the outcome of the war in Ukraine, the trajectory of U.S.-China relations, the internal stability of both regimes, and events no one can yet foresee. What's certain is that the relationship between Beijing and Moscow—forged in shared grievance, sustained by mutual benefit, and tested by war—will remain one of the defining partnerships of our era.</p>
