<h2>Why You Run Faster When Someone's Watching</h2>

<p>In 1898, a psychologist named Norman Triplett noticed something peculiar about bicycle racing records. When cyclists raced against the clock alone, they were consistently slower than when they raced against other cyclists. This wasn't just about competition pushing them harder. Something about the mere presence of other people seemed to unlock hidden reserves of energy and speed.</p>

<p>Triplett was so intrigued that he devised an experiment using children and fishing reels. He had kids wind string as fast as they could, sometimes alone, sometimes side by side with another child doing the same task. The results confirmed his hunch: children wound faster when someone else was winding nearby, even when they weren't directly competing.</p>

<p>This discovery launched more than a century of research into what psychologists now call social facilitation—the phenomenon where being around other people changes how well we perform tasks. But here's where it gets interesting: sometimes the presence of others makes us better, and sometimes it makes us dramatically worse.</p>

<h2>The Puzzle That Stumped Psychologists for Decades</h2>

<p>After Triplett's initial findings, researchers rushed to test whether the presence of others always improved performance. In 1924, Floyd Allport—who actually coined the term "social facilitation"—ran studies where people completed word associations and multiplication problems either alone or in groups. The group settings seemed to help. People performed better.</p>

<p>But not always.</p>

<p>Other studies found exactly the opposite. Sometimes having an audience made people fumble, freeze, or fail spectacularly. A pianist who plays flawlessly in practice might stumble through a recital. A student who knows the material cold might blank during an oral exam. For decades, researchers couldn't figure out why the presence of others helped in some cases and hurt in others.</p>

<p>The contradiction seemed to undermine the whole concept of social facilitation. Was it even a real phenomenon, or were researchers just finding whatever they expected to find?</p>

<h2>Robert Zajonc Cracks the Code</h2>

<p>The breakthrough came in 1965 from Robert Zajonc, a social psychologist who pronounced his name "ZY-unce" despite the spelling. Zajonc noticed a pattern hiding in the contradictory research: the presence of others seemed to help with simple, well-practiced tasks but hurt with complex or unfamiliar ones.</p>

<p>His explanation drew on something called dominant responses. Think of your brain as having a hierarchy of possible reactions to any situation. At the top of that hierarchy sit your dominant responses—the actions that come most naturally, the behaviors you've practiced until they're automatic. Below them are non-dominant responses, which require more conscious effort and concentration.</p>

<p>When you're around other people, Zajonc argued, your arousal increases. Your heart beats a little faster. You become more alert. This heightened state of activation makes your dominant responses even more likely to emerge—and your non-dominant responses harder to access.</p>

<p>For a task you've mastered, this is great news. Your dominant response is already the correct one, so increased arousal helps you execute it faster and more reliably. But for a task you're still learning, your dominant response is probably wrong—it's the mistake you keep making, the old habit you're trying to override. When arousal strengthens that wrong response, you perform worse.</p>

<h3>The Yerkes-Dodson Connection</h3>

<p>Zajonc's theory aligned beautifully with earlier research by psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dodson, who had discovered that arousal and performance follow an inverted U-shaped curve. A little arousal helps performance. Too much hurts it. And crucially, the optimal level of arousal is lower for complex tasks than for simple ones.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to thread a needle. A small amount of alertness helps you focus. But if someone yells "Hurry up!" while you're doing it, the surge of arousal makes your hands shake. Now imagine catching a ball thrown at your face. More arousal actually helps—your reflexes sharpen, your reaction time improves.</p>

<p>The presence of other people adds arousal to whatever you're already feeling. For easy tasks, this boost pushes you toward peak performance. For hard tasks, it can push you over the edge into anxiety and failure.</p>

<h2>Three Competing Explanations</h2>

<p>Zajonc's "mere presence" theory was elegant, but it raised an obvious question: why would simply being around other people increase our arousal? Are humans just inherently excitable in social situations?</p>

<p>Researchers have proposed three main answers, each with substantial evidence behind it.</p>

<h3>The Evaluation Theory</h3>

<p>In 1968, Thomas Henchy and David Glass argued that it's not the presence of others that revs us up—it's the fear of being judged by them. They called this "evaluation apprehension."</p>

<p>Think about the difference between practicing guitar alone in your room versus playing at an open mic night. The audience isn't just present; they're assessing you. Every fumbled chord feels magnified. Every smooth transition feels like a small victory. This evaluative pressure, Henchy and Glass argued, is what really drives social facilitation effects.</p>

<p>Nickolas Cottrell expanded this idea in 1972. He suggested that we've learned through experience that other people are the primary sources of rewards and punishments in our lives. From childhood, we're praised or criticized, accepted or rejected, based on how we perform in front of others. So we've developed a conditioned response: when others are present, we feel apprehensive about being evaluated, and that apprehension creates arousal.</p>

<p>Supporting this view, studies have found that social facilitation effects often disappear when the audience clearly can't evaluate the performer. Blindfolded observers, for instance, don't trigger the same arousal as attentive ones watching your every move.</p>

<h3>The Alertness Theory</h3>

<p>But here's a counterargument: what if we're not worried about judgment so much as we're just... watchful?</p>

<p>The alertness hypothesis suggests that other people introduce uncertainty into our environment. We don't know exactly what they might do. They could help us, ignore us, interrupt us, or cause problems we'll need to respond to. This unpredictability keeps us on our toes, heightening our alertness even when no evaluation is taking place.</p>

<p>This makes evolutionary sense. For most of human history, another person's unexpected behavior could mean the difference between life and death. A stranger approaching could be a friend, a rival, or a threat. The safest response was to stay alert until the situation clarified itself.</p>

<p>The monitoring hypothesis adds a wrinkle: social facilitation effects should be weaker when we know the people around us well. A familiar face is a predictable face. Your spouse sitting in the room while you work shouldn't trigger the same arousal as a stranger, because you already know how they're likely to behave.</p>

<h3>The Distraction Theory</h3>

<p>The third major explanation focuses on attention rather than arousal. According to this view, other people are simply distracting. They draw our attention away from the task at hand, and this creates a conflict.</p>

<p>For simple tasks, the distraction barely matters—the task requires so little of our mental resources that we can handle both the task and the social awareness without trouble. In fact, the mild stress of managing both might even sharpen our focus.</p>

<p>But for complex tasks, we need every scrap of attention we can muster. When other people siphon off some of that attention, we don't have enough left for the task, and our performance suffers.</p>

<h2>The Challenge and Threat Response</h2>

<p>One particularly fascinating refinement of social facilitation theory comes from cardiovascular research. When people perform tasks in front of others, their bodies respond in measurably different ways depending on task difficulty.</p>

<p>For simple tasks, people show what's called a "challenge" cardiovascular pattern: increased heart rate, but also more efficient blood flow and lower vascular resistance. Their bodies are energized but not stressed. It's the same pattern you'd see in an athlete who feels confident about winning.</p>

<p>For complex tasks, though, people often show a "threat" cardiovascular pattern: increased heart rate combined with constricted blood vessels and less efficient blood flow. Their bodies are responding as if facing danger. This threat state doesn't just feel worse—it actually impairs the cognitive flexibility and fine motor control needed for complex performance.</p>

<p>Your body literally prepares differently for an easy challenge versus a hard one, and the presence of other people amplifies whichever pattern is already triggered.</p>

<h2>What the Science Means for Real Life</h2>

<p>Understanding social facilitation has practical implications that extend far beyond psychology laboratories.</p>

<p>Consider learning a new skill. The early stages, when everything feels awkward and you're making lots of mistakes, might be better practiced in private. Your dominant responses during this phase are wrong, so having an audience could strengthen exactly the errors you're trying to eliminate. But once you've practiced enough that the correct response becomes dominant, performing in front of others might actually help you execute with more energy and precision.</p>

<p>This suggests that the common advice to "practice like you perform" needs nuance. Practice alone when you're still figuring things out. Practice with others once you've got it down.</p>

<p>The phenomenon also helps explain stage fright. When you're anxious about performing—when your dominant response is to freeze or flee rather than to smoothly execute the task—having an audience makes that anxiety response even more dominant. Breaking out of this pattern requires so much practice that confident execution becomes your new dominant response.</p>

<h3>Social Facilitation in the Digital Age</h3>

<p>The rise of remote work has created a natural experiment in social facilitation. Many knowledge workers report that working from home eliminates certain pressures—no one walking past their desk, no sense of being watched. For complex creative tasks requiring deep focus, this privacy might actually improve performance.</p>

<p>But those same workers often miss the ambient energy of being around colleagues. For routine tasks that benefit from simple accountability, the home office can feel too comfortable, too easy to slack in. Some people install "virtual coworking" apps that simulate the presence of others specifically to recapture social facilitation effects.</p>

<h2>Beyond Individual Performance</h2>

<p>Social facilitation also has implications for how we design spaces and structure activities. Open-plan offices, for instance, maximize the presence of others—which might help with simple, well-practiced tasks but hurt with complex creative work. This could partly explain why many workers find open offices so frustrating: the very presence of colleagues that helps them power through email undermines their ability to concentrate on challenging problems.</p>

<p>Interestingly, research has found that even the implied presence of others can trigger social facilitation effects. Posters with eyes, mirrors, and other cues that suggest observation can slightly increase arousal and shift the balance between dominant and non-dominant responses. Some studies have found that donation boxes with eye-like images collect more money than those without—as if the mere suggestion of being watched activates our social performance instincts.</p>

<p>A 2010 neuroimaging study found that when people decided whether to donate money, the presence of observers significantly affected activity in the ventral striatum, a brain region involved in reward processing. We seem to be wired at a neural level to care about how our choices appear to others.</p>

<h2>The Write-In Connection</h2>

<p>There's a reason why writing groups, write-ins, and library writing sessions remain popular even though writing is fundamentally a solitary activity. For experienced writers who have made the physical act of typing and the basic craft of sentence construction into dominant responses, the presence of others provides just enough arousal to help them maintain focus and momentum.</p>

<p>The key is that the others present are also writing, not judging. This creates what's called "coaction"—parallel activity without direct competition or evaluation. You're not performing for an audience; you're working alongside fellow workers. The mutual presence creates accountability and energy without the threat of harsh judgment that could interfere with the vulnerable, complex work of creating something new.</p>

<p>This explains why many writers find coffee shops helpful for productivity: the ambient presence of others provides mild social facilitation, while the strangers' obvious disinterest removes evaluation apprehension. You get the arousal benefits without the judgment costs.</p>

<h2>What We're Still Learning</h2>

<p>After more than 125 years of research, social facilitation remains an active area of study. Recent work has examined how the phenomenon plays out in people with autism spectrum disorder, who may process social presence differently than neurotypical individuals. Researchers are also exploring how virtual presence—avatars, video calls, social media audiences—compares to physical presence in triggering facilitation effects.</p>

<p>One particularly intriguing finding from a 2002 meta-analysis: despite all the theories about evaluation apprehension, the social facilitation effect turns out to be "surprisingly unrelated to the performer's evaluation apprehension." People who are very worried about being judged don't show systematically different social facilitation effects than people who aren't worried at all.</p>

<p>This suggests that Zajonc's original "mere presence" hypothesis might have been closer to the truth than the more elaborate theories that followed. Perhaps we don't need to invoke fear of judgment or learned associations. Perhaps there's something more fundamental about social presence that affects our performance—something built into the basic architecture of social animals.</p>

<p>We're still unraveling exactly what that something is. But the core discovery remains as relevant as it was when Triplett first watched those cyclists: we are different people when we're alone versus when we're with others. The presence of our fellow humans changes us, for better and for worse, in ways we're only beginning to understand.</p>
