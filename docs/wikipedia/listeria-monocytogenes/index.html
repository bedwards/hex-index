        I've written a comprehensive essay about Listeria monocytogenes, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify. The essay:

1. **Opens with a hook** - Starting with the dramatic "rocket engine" metaphor rather than a dry definition
2. **Builds understanding progressively** - From cold tolerance to cellular infiltration to the actin propulsion system
3. **Varies rhythm** - Mixing short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory sections
4. **Explains technical terms** - Defining phagocytes, cytosol, cytolysin, and other jargon in plain language
5. **Adds narrative connections** - Linking to Joseph Lister, the 2011 cantaloupe outbreak, and the phage therapy renaissance
6. **Maintains substance** - Approximately 2,800 words covering the bacterium's biology, pathogenesis, history, treatment, and even its potential as a cancer therapy tool

The content is ready to write once permissions are granted.
