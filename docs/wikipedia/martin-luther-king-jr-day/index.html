        Let me output the rewritten article as requested:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day">Wikipedia: Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a></p>

<p>In 1983, Jesse Helms stood on the floor of the United States Senate and threw down a 300-page dossier. The document alleged that Martin Luther King Jr. had associations with communists—a last-ditch effort to kill legislation that would honor King with a federal holiday. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York picked up the document, called it "a packet of filth," hurled it to the ground, and stomped on it.</p>

<p>The bill passed anyway. Two weeks later, Ronald Reagan—who had privately written that the holiday's momentum was "based on an image, not reality"—signed it into law.</p>

<p>This is how America got Martin Luther King Jr. Day: through a fifteen-year battle involving labor unions, corporate pressure campaigns, Stevie Wonder, the NFL, and one of the largest petition drives in American history.</p>

<h2>The Campaign Begins</h2>

<p>Four days after King was assassinated in Memphis in April 1968, two congressmen introduced a bill to make his birthday a national holiday. Representative John Conyers, a Democrat from Michigan, and Senator Edward Brooke, a Republican from Massachusetts, saw an opportunity to honor the slain civil rights leader while the nation still mourned.</p>

<p>They were eleven years early.</p>

<p>The bill went nowhere at first. Critics raised two main objections. First, a paid holiday for federal employees would be expensive—millions of dollars annually in wages for work not performed. Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, America had never created a national holiday for a private citizen. King had never held public office. The only individuals honored with federal holidays were George Washington and Christopher Columbus, and one of those was literally the first president.</p>

<p>When the bill finally came to a vote in the House in 1979, it failed. But something interesting happened in the interim: labor unions had started negotiating King's birthday as a paid holiday in their contracts. The idea was gaining traction from the bottom up.</p>

<h2>Stevie Wonder and Six Million Signatures</h2>

<p>The King Center, founded by Coretta Scott King to preserve her husband's legacy, pivoted to a new strategy. Rather than relying solely on congressional persuasion, they would build a coalition of corporate support and public pressure.</p>

<p>In 1980, Stevie Wonder released "Happy Birthday"—not a generic celebration song, but a direct appeal for the King holiday. The lyrics called out the absurdity of honoring "some old slavemaster" with a holiday while denying one to King. Wonder performed the song at the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981, turning a legislative campaign into a cultural movement.</p>

<p>The petition drive that followed gathered six million signatures. A 2006 article in The Nation called it "the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history." Congress was facing not just a policy question but a referendum on whether America would honor its most famous advocate for nonviolent social change.</p>

<h2>The Opposition</h2>

<p>Jesse Helms and John East, both Republican senators from North Carolina, led the resistance. Their arguments went beyond fiscal concerns.</p>

<p>Helms questioned whether King was "important enough" for such an honor. He criticized King's opposition to the Vietnam War and accused him of "action-oriented Marxism"—a Cold War-era dog whistle suggesting that civil rights activism was really communist subversion. The 300-page dossier Helms submitted to the Senate drew on FBI surveillance of King, files that had been sealed and wouldn't be released for decades.</p>

<p>When reporters asked President Reagan about Helms's communist accusations, Reagan gave a revealing answer: "We'll know in thirty-five years, won't we?"—a reference to when the FBI tapes would become public. This was not exactly a ringing endorsement of the man the holiday would honor.</p>

<p>But Reagan read the political winds. The House had passed the bill 338 to 90. The Senate passed it 78 to 22. Both margins were veto-proof. Fighting this battle would cost political capital with no possibility of victory.</p>

<p>On November 2, 1983, Reagan signed the King Holiday Act into law.</p>

<h2>The State-by-State Battle</h2>

<p>Federal holidays apply to federal employees and operations. Whether states observe the same holidays—and what they call them—is entirely up to them. This meant the fight continued for another seventeen years.</p>

<p>Arizona became the most contentious battleground.</p>

<p>In 1986, outgoing Democratic Governor Bruce Babbitt created a paid state MLK holiday by executive order. Days after taking office in 1987, his Republican successor Evan Mecham reversed it, citing a legal opinion that Babbitt's order exceeded his authority. Mecham then proclaimed the third Sunday in January as "Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day"—but as an unpaid holiday, a distinction that satisfied almost no one.</p>

<p>In 1990, Arizona voters faced two ballot propositions. Proposition 301 would have replaced Columbus Day with King Day. Proposition 302 would have merged Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays to make room for King Day. Both failed, though Prop 302 came close with 49% approval.</p>

<p>The National Football League had been watching. The league had planned to hold Super Bowl XXVII in Arizona in 1993, but after the referendum failed, they moved it to Pasadena, California. The economic blow—estimated at over $100 million in lost revenue—changed the political calculus. In 1992, Arizona voters approved a King holiday, this time given only one option rather than the confusing choice between two alternatives.</p>

<h2>The Confederate Holidays Problem</h2>

<p>Some states found creative ways to observe the federal holiday while hedging their symbolic commitments.</p>

<p>In Alabama, the day was designated "Robert E. Lee/Martin Luther King Birthday"—a pairing that would be almost comical if it weren't so pointed. Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, was born on January 19, close enough to King's January 15 birthday to create this awkward fusion. Mississippi adopted the same approach: "Martin Luther King's and Robert E. Lee's Birthdays."</p>

<p>Virginia went further, combining King's birthday with the existing Lee-Jackson Day (honoring Lee and Stonewall Jackson) into "Lee-Jackson-King Day." It took until 2000 to separate them, and Lee-Jackson Day wasn't eliminated entirely until 2020.</p>

<p>Arkansas observed "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday and Robert E. Lee's Birthday" from 1985 until 2017, when legislation finally moved Lee's commemoration to October.</p>

<p>South Carolina was the last holdout for a different reason. Until 2000, state employees could choose between observing Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three Confederate holidays. The choice itself was the statement.</p>

<p>New Hampshire, the "Live Free or Die" state, took the most neutral approach, calling it "Civil Rights Day" until 1999. When the legislature finally voted to rename it Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the first statewide celebration under that name occurred in January 2000—marking the first time every state in the union observed a holiday specifically named for King.</p>

<h2>What the Day Means Now</h2>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. Day falls on the third Monday of January, never earlier than January 15 (King's actual birthday) and never later than January 21. This follows the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which moved several federal holidays to Mondays to create long weekends—a practical consideration that occasionally draws criticism for prioritizing leisure over reflection.</p>

<p>In 1994, Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act, signed by President Bill Clinton. The legislation reframes the day as a "day of service" rather than just a day off—a deliberate attempt to connect commemoration with action. AmeriCorps, the federal volunteer agency, has coordinated service activities on MLK Day since 1996.</p>

<p>The only other national day of service in America is September 11.</p>

<p>As of 2019, about 45% of employers gave employees the day off. The reasons for the gap vary. Some cite the holiday's relative newness (it's the most recently established federal holiday honoring an individual). Others note its timing—just two weeks after the Christmas-New Year period when many businesses already close. Schools and universities split: some close entirely, others hold special programming about King's legacy, and some have extended their winter breaks to encompass it.</p>

<p>Banks close. The stock markets close. But the Post Office delivers packages, if not regular mail. The day occupies an ambiguous space in American civic life—more observed than Veterans Day in some ways, less than Thanksgiving in others.</p>

<h2>Beyond America's Borders</h2>

<p>The day has taken root in unexpected places.</p>

<p>In 1984, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff, a U.S. Navy chaplain, conducted what appears to be the first Israeli presidential ceremony commemorating King, held at the President's Residence in Jerusalem. Aura Herzog, wife of then-President Chaim Herzog, noted that Israel maintained a national forest in King's honor and that both the nation and the man shared a commitment to "dreams."</p>

<p>Resnicoff's remarks drew on Genesis—the story of Joseph's brothers seeing him approach and saying, "Behold the dreamer comes; let us slay him and throw him into the pit, and see what becomes of his dreams." The rabbi observed that throughout history, people have thought they could kill a dream by killing the dreamer. They are always wrong.</p>

<p>Hiroshima, Japan, observes the day as well. In 2005, Mayor Tadatoshi Akiba hosted a special banquet connecting his city's call for peace—Hiroshima being the first city destroyed by an atomic bomb—with King's message of human rights. The pairing makes a certain sense: both King and Hiroshima represent the consequences of American power and the possibility of transformation.</p>

<p>In Wassenaar, Netherlands, the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner has been held annually since 1987. Veterans of the civil rights movement gather alongside young people. The event always concludes the same way: everyone holds hands in a circle and sings "We Shall Overcome."</p>

<h2>The Ongoing Argument</h2>

<p>The fifteen-year campaign for the King holiday was, in some ways, an argument about what kind of country America wanted to be. Was King a communist agitator or a prophet of beloved community? Was nonviolent resistance a threat to social order or the highest expression of democratic values? Did honoring a private citizen diminish the presidency, or did it recognize that moral leadership can emerge from outside the halls of power?</p>

<p>These questions were not settled by the law Reagan signed. They were deferred.</p>

<p>Every January, when schools and banks close and volunteer projects convene, the argument continues. Some Americans see the day as vindication of the civil rights movement's methods and goals. Others treat it as a day off, no more meaningful than Columbus Day. Still others use King's words selectively, quoting his appeals to colorblindness while ignoring his critiques of capitalism, militarism, and what he called "the fierce urgency of now."</p>

<p>King himself might have found the holiday uncomfortable. In his lifetime, he was considered dangerous enough to warrant constant FBI surveillance. J. Edgar Hoover called him "the most dangerous Negro in America." The same government that tracked his movements and tried to destroy his reputation now closes its offices in his honor.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's the point. The holiday commemorates not just a man but a transformation—America's slow, contentious, still-incomplete reckoning with the promise of equality and the reality of its history. The stomped dossier on the Senate floor, the Super Bowl pulled from Arizona, the Confederate generals uncomfortably sharing calendar space with a Baptist preacher from Atlanta: these are the textures of a country arguing with itself.</p>

<p>The argument continues because it has to. That may be the most honest way to honor a man who spent his life insisting that America's work was not yet done.</p>
