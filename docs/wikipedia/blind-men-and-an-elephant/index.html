        I've written the rewritten article but need write permission to save it. The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. It:

- Opens with a vivid scene (the king's experiment) rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Explains concepts like anekāntavāda and syādvāda from first principles
- Includes the philosophical critique of how the parable is sometimes misused
- Connects to modern applications in physics, medicine, and biology
- Adds the meta-observation about how readers approach the story exactly like blind men approach the elephant
- Maintains the source attribution at the top

Would you like me to output the HTML content directly so you can save it, or grant write permission for the file?
