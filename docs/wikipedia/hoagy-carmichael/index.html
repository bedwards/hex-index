        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article about Hoagy Carmichael, transforming it from encyclopedic reference material into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. However, the file system is blocking me from creating the new file.

The essay is ready and covers:
- His unusual name origin (from circus performers)
- Childhood poverty and the tragedy of his sister's death
- His friendship with Bix Beiderbecke and Louis Armstrong
- The story of "Stardust" and how it initially flopped before becoming one of the most covered songs ever
- His failed legal career and eventual embrace of music
- His innovative use of microphone technology despite his "flatsy" voice
- Major hits including "Georgia on My Mind," "Heart and Soul," and "The Nearness of You"
- His Hollywood career and Oscar win
- His lasting legacy in American popular music

To proceed, you'll need to either:
1. Grant permission to write to the `docs/wikipedia/hoagy-carmichael/` directory
2. Or create the directory manually and I can try again
