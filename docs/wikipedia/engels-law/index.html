        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for Speechify reading. The output is clean HTML with:

- A hook opening about the UN's 30% threshold rather than a dry definition
- Varied paragraph lengths (some punchy 1-2 sentences, others longer explanations)
- Semantic markup (`<p>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, etc.)
- Spelled out concepts and avoided jargon
- Narrative flow with transitions between sections
- Interesting connections (US agricultural workforce decline, inflation detection technique)
- Source attribution at the top

The essay runs approximately 2,200 words, which should provide about 12-15 minutes of listening time—substantive but not exhausting.
