        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Newgrounds. Here's a summary of what I produced:

**The rewritten article** transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features:

- **Strong hook**: Opens with the Friday Night Funkin' server crash story rather than a dry definition
- **Narrative structure**: Tells the story chronologically, from Tom Fulp's 1991 fanzine through to the present day
- **Explanatory context**: Explains Flash technology, fanzines, ActionScript, Rust, and WebAssembly for readers who may not know these terms
- **Varied rhythm**: Mixes short punchy paragraphs with longer explanatory ones for better audio listening
- **Interesting connections**: Added context about Steve Jobs' Flash letter, FutureSplash history, and how the judgment system presaged modern content moderation
- **Thoughtful framing**: Concludes with reflection on Newgrounds' position against algorithmic platforms and AI content

The article is approximately 3,000 words (~15-20 minutes reading time) and covers:
1. The founding story and fanzine origins
2. The Flash revolution and its democratizing effect
3. The Portal and automated submissions
4. The judgment/scouting content moderation systems
5. The golden age (2000s statistics, careers launched)
6. Flash's death and Ruffle resurrection
7. The Tumblr exodus
8. Controversial games (V-Tech Rampage, Torture Game 2, Sandy Hook)
9. AI content policy
10. Current state and cultural significance
