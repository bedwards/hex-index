        I've written a rewritten essay on Henry Sidgwick. Here's the HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick">Wikipedia: Henry Sidgwick</a></p>

<p>Here is a man who resigned his fellowship at Cambridge because he could no longer, in good conscience, call himself a member of the Church of England. A man who spent decades investigating séances and mediums—not because he believed in them, but because he wanted desperately to find evidence of an afterlife, evidence that might resolve what he saw as an unbridgeable gap in moral philosophy. A man whose book on ethics was called by John Rawls "the first truly academic work in moral theory, modern in both method and spirit." And yet, within decades of his death, Henry Sidgwick was largely forgotten, dismissed as a minor Victorian figure.</p>

<p>His rehabilitation in recent years tells us something about how philosophy works—how ideas that seem unfashionable in one era become indispensable in another.</p>

<h2>The Problem That Haunted Him</h2>

<p>Sidgwick was born in 1838 in Yorkshire, the son of a headmaster who died when Henry was just three years old. He was educated at Rugby and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined the Cambridge Apostles—an intellectual society that would count among its members Tennyson, Bertrand Russell, and later the economist John Maynard Keynes.</p>

<p>He was brilliant in the conventional sense. In 1859, he won the chancellor's medal and was elected to a fellowship at Trinity. He began as a classics lecturer, but philosophy pulled at him. By 1869, he had switched to moral philosophy full-time.</p>

<p>That same year, he did something remarkable. Unable to honestly affirm his membership in the Church of England—a requirement for holding his fellowship—he resigned it. This was not a small sacrifice. A Cambridge fellowship in the nineteenth century meant security, status, and a community of intellectual equals. Sidgwick gave it up because he could not, as he put it, "in good conscience" make a declaration he did not believe.</p>

<p>He kept his lectureship, which had no such requirement. And in 1885, after Cambridge finally abolished its religious tests, Trinity elected him back to a fellowship. But that sixteen-year gap reveals something essential about Sidgwick: he took intellectual honesty seriously, even when it cost him.</p>

<h2>The Dualism of Practical Reason</h2>

<p>What was Sidgwick trying to solve? The central puzzle that consumed him was this: utilitarianism—the philosophy that says we should maximize overall happiness—seems obviously right in many ways. But it also seems to require us to sacrifice our own interests for the greater good. And why should we do that?</p>

<p>The earlier utilitarians, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, had a problem. They claimed that everyone always pursues their own self-interest (what Sidgwick called "psychological hedonism"). But they also claimed that everyone should act for the general interest (what he called "ethical hedonism"). These two claims sit in tension. If I always act for my own interest, how can you tell me I should act for everyone's interest?</p>

<p>Sidgwick saw three distinct methods for determining right conduct. First, intuitionism: the idea that certain moral principles are self-evidently true, that we can simply perceive what is right and wrong through a kind of moral sense. Second, egoistic hedonism: the view that I should maximize my own pleasure and minimize my own pain. Third, universal hedonism or utilitarianism: the view that I should maximize pleasure and minimize pain for everyone.</p>

<p>He believed that intuitionism and utilitarianism could be reconciled. Our intuitions, properly examined, tend to support utilitarian conclusions. But egoism was another matter entirely.</p>

<p>Why should I sacrifice my own happiness for the general welfare? Sidgwick could find no rational answer. If I am a purely rational egoist, maximizing my own well-being, there is no logical argument that can compel me to consider others. This created what he called "the dualism of practical reason"—a fundamental contradiction at the heart of ethics that he could not resolve.</p>

<p>Unless, perhaps, there were an afterlife.</p>

<h2>The Ghost Hunter</h2>

<p>This brings us to one of the strangest chapters in the history of philosophy. Sidgwick was a founder and the first president of the Society for Psychical Research, established in 1882. This was not a group of credulous believers. It was a serious scientific organization dedicated to investigating claims of telepathy, clairvoyance, and communication with the dead.</p>

<p>Why would a rigorous philosopher spend so much time on séances?</p>

<p>Because if there were an afterlife with rewards and punishments, the dualism of practical reason would dissolve. If virtuous behavior leads to happiness after death, then egoism and utilitarianism converge. The rational egoist has reason to be moral because morality pays off in eternity.</p>

<p>Sidgwick was not hoping to prove Christianity true. He had already abandoned that faith. But he thought empirical investigation might reveal something about the nature of consciousness and survival after death that could rescue ethics from its fundamental contradiction.</p>

<p>The irony is that Sidgwick and his group became famous not for proving the paranormal but for exposing fraud. They debunked medium after medium, including the famous Eusapia Palladino. According to his biographer Bart Schultz, Sidgwick had "an overwhelmingly negative, destructive effect" on parapsychology, "akin to that of recent debunkers." He wanted so badly to believe, but his intellectual honesty would not let him accept anything less than rigorous evidence. And rigorous evidence never came.</p>

<h2>The Methods of Ethics</h2>

<p>Published in 1874, The Methods of Ethics is Sidgwick's masterpiece and the reason he is still read today. What makes it remarkable is not any single argument but its method.</p>

<p>Previous moral philosophers had typically advocated for their preferred system and attacked rivals. Sidgwick did something different. He examined each ethical approach on its own terms, charitably reconstructing the strongest version of each position before comparing them. He was less interested in winning arguments than in understanding where each view succeeded and where it broke down.</p>

<p>This "comparative methodology" became, in the words of philosopher Allen Wood, the "standard model" of research methodology among contemporary ethicists. Before Sidgwick, moral philosophy was often partisan and polemical. After Sidgwick, it became possible—expected, even—to survey the field of ethical theories with something approaching scientific detachment.</p>

<p>Rawls was not exaggerating when he called it the first truly academic work in moral theory. Sidgwick professionalized ethics. He turned it from a series of competing sermons into a systematic discipline.</p>

<h2>Esoteric Morality</h2>

<p>There is a darker side to Sidgwick's utilitarianism, one that later philosophers have found troubling. He believed in what has been called "esoteric morality"—the idea that the correct moral theory might not be the best theory to teach everyone.</p>

<p>Think about it this way: if utilitarianism is true, and we should maximize overall happiness, it might turn out that overall happiness is best maximized if most people believe something other than utilitarianism. Perhaps ordinary people do better following simple rules like "don't lie" and "keep your promises," while a small elite makes the utilitarian calculations behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The philosopher Bernard Williams memorably called this "Government House Utilitarianism," a reference to the colonial administrative buildings where British officials made decisions for subject peoples who were not consulted. Williams saw in Sidgwick's esoteric morality the paternalism and elitism of the British Empire.</p>

<p>This criticism has real bite. Sidgwick was writing at the height of British imperialism, and there is something uncomfortable about a philosophy that distinguishes between the moral truths fit for the enlightened few and the useful fictions appropriate for the masses.</p>

<h2>The Economist</h2>

<p>Sidgwick was not only a moral philosopher. He made significant contributions to economics during a transitional period when the discipline was transforming from the classical economics of Adam Smith and David Ricardo into the neoclassical economics of marginal utility.</p>

<p>His economic thought centered on a tension similar to his ethical dualism. Self-interest, he believed, was central to human motivation, and he saw nothing wrong with people trying to buy cheap and sell dear. Markets harness self-interest productively.</p>

<p>But he also recognized limits. Individual wealth-maximization does not automatically produce social wealth-maximization. Sometimes what is good for each person separately is bad for everyone together—a problem economists now call collective action failures or, in some contexts, the tragedy of the commons.</p>

<p>He also noted that wealth is not everything. A society that maximizes wealth might still fail to maximize welfare. People have needs beyond money—for leisure, for meaning, for relationships—that pure economic calculation misses.</p>

<p>These insights influenced Arthur Cecil Pigou, whose book The Economics of Welfare founded the field of welfare economics. Pigou's concept of externalities—costs or benefits that economic transactions impose on third parties—owes much to Sidgwick's analysis of how individual and social interests diverge.</p>

<p>Alfred Marshall, the founder of the Cambridge School of Economics and one of the most influential economists of the twentieth century, called Sidgwick his "spiritual mother and father."</p>

<h2>The Champion of Women's Education</h2>

<p>One of Sidgwick's most lasting practical achievements had nothing to do with philosophy or economics. In 1875, together with the suffragist Millicent Garrett Fawcett, he co-founded Newnham College at Cambridge—only the second college at the university to admit women.</p>

<p>This was radical. Cambridge would not grant women full degrees until 1948, seventy-three years later. In Sidgwick's time, the very idea that women could benefit from higher education was controversial. He did not just advocate for women's education in the abstract; he helped create the institutional infrastructure that made it possible.</p>

<p>It began with his support for lectures to prepare women for examinations. When Anne Clough opened a small house of residence for these women students, Sidgwick encouraged and supported the venture. That house grew into Newnham College. When a new building was added in 1880, Sidgwick himself lived there for two years.</p>

<p>His wife, Eleanor Mildred Balfour, was a physics researcher who became principal of Newnham after Clough's death in 1892. She was also the sister of Arthur Balfour, who would later become Prime Minister. The Sidgwicks lived at Newnham for the rest of Henry's life, deeply involved in the college's welfare.</p>

<h2>The Fall and Rise of a Reputation</h2>

<p>When Sidgwick died in 1900—an agnostic to the end, his search for evidence of an afterlife unfulfilled—he was a major figure in British intellectual life. Within a few decades, he was nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>Why? Several explanations have been offered. The Bloomsbury Group, which dominated Cambridge intellectual culture in the early twentieth century, dismissed him. Wittgenstein's ordinary language philosophy had no use for his systematic approach. The remnants of British idealism saw him as an opponent.</p>

<p>But perhaps the deeper reason lies in changes to the philosophy of mathematics. Sidgwick's ethics depended on the idea that moral axioms could be known with certainty, like mathematical axioms. When twentieth-century developments—particularly Gödel's incompleteness theorems—showed that even mathematics could not be placed on perfectly secure axiomatic foundations, Sidgwick's epistemological approach seemed naive.</p>

<p>His revival began in the mid-twentieth century and accelerated with the publication of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice in 1971. Rawls disagreed with Sidgwick's utilitarianism, but he took him seriously as an interlocutor. More importantly, Rawls adopted Sidgwick's comparative methodology—the patient, charitable examination of rival theories—as the proper approach to moral philosophy.</p>

<p>Derek Parfit, whose Reasons and Persons is often considered the most important work of moral philosophy since Rawls, was even more directly influenced by Sidgwick. Parfit took up the dualism of practical reason as a central problem and spent his career trying to solve it.</p>

<h2>A Personal Struggle</h2>

<p>A 2004 biography by Bart Schultz brought to light evidence that Sidgwick struggled throughout his life with what he experienced as forbidden desires. Schultz argues that Sidgwick was homosexual, though it is unclear whether he ever acted on these feelings.</p>

<p>This adds another dimension to his lifelong preoccupation with hypocrisy and authenticity. Here was a man who resigned his fellowship rather than make a religious declaration he did not believe, who spent decades investigating psychic phenomena in hopes of finding some foundation for morality, who wrote endlessly about the conflict between self-interest and the demands of ethics. His personal struggles with concealment and honesty seem to have been woven into his philosophy.</p>

<p>We should be careful about psychoanalyzing the dead. But it is hard not to see a connection between Sidgwick's anguished search for a rational foundation for self-sacrifice and his own experience of sacrificing authenticity for social acceptance.</p>

<h2>The Unresolved Question</h2>

<p>Sidgwick never solved the dualism of practical reason. He admitted frankly that he could find no way to rationally compel the egoist to care about others. This failure has been seen by some as a devastating objection to his whole project. If moral philosophy cannot explain why we should be moral, what good is it?</p>

<p>But perhaps the failure is more honest than the alternatives. Many moral philosophers claim to have solved this problem, but their solutions often depend on assumptions that a determined skeptic can reject. Sidgwick's intellectual honesty—the same honesty that made him resign his fellowship, expose fraudulent mediums, and die an agnostic—would not let him pretend to have an answer he did not possess.</p>

<p>He left behind a methodology, a body of careful analysis, and a problem. The methodology transformed moral philosophy into a professional academic discipline. The analysis still repays study. And the problem remains unsolved.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is enough for one life.</p>
