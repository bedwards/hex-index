        I've completed the rewrite. The article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I did:

**Hook**: Opened with vivid imagery of men living "like moles" rather than a dry definition of trench warfare.

**Structure**: Organized around compelling questions (How did millions end up underground? Why did it take so long?) rather than chronological encyclopedia sections.

**Audio optimization**: 
- Varied sentence and paragraph length for natural rhythm
- Spelled out abbreviations (World War One instead of WWI)
- Removed jargon or explained it immediately
- Used conversational transitions

**Substantive content**: Kept the historical depth including:
- The technology mismatch that created stalemate
- Ancient precedents (Roman legions, Battle of the Trench, American Civil War)
- Trench construction details and the specialized "trenchmen"
- The logistics problem that prevented breakthroughs
- Battle statistics that convey the scale of loss

The essay runs approximately 2,500 words, which translates to roughly 15-20 minutes of reading time—appropriate for the Speechify use case.
