        I've prepared the rewritten article for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/terminal-high-altitude-area-defense/index.html`, but I need permission to create this new file.

The article transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The first combat interception in 2022, not a dry definition
2. **Explains hit-to-kill physics** using the rock/bullet analogy to make kinetic energy intuitive
3. **Covers the Gulf War origins** and the humbling early failures (six missed intercepts)
4. **Breaks down the three phases** of ballistic missile flight to explain why "terminal" matters
5. **Details the Korean controversy** - China's radar concerns, economic boycotts, domestic protests
6. **Addresses the hypersonic problem** - the May 2025 failures and what they mean
7. **Explores the economic equation** - the cost asymmetry favoring attackers
8. **Discusses layered defense** concepts and how THAAD fits with other systems

The article runs approximately 20 minutes of reading time and is optimized for Speechify text-to-speech with varied paragraph and sentence lengths.
