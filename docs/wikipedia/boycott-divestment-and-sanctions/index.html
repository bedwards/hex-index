        I've written a comprehensive essay on the BDS movement that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a readable, narrative-driven piece optimized for text-to-speech. The essay:

- Opens with a hook about the movement's founding rather than a dry definition
- Explains the three demands clearly, especially the controversial "right of return"
- Unpacks the apartheid comparison from both sides
- Traces the movement's origins from Durban through 2005
- Explores the philosophy and the antisemitism debate with nuance
- Covers the internal debate between BDS and liberal Zionists
- Addresses legal responses and effectiveness
- Concludes with the deeper question at stake

The piece runs approximately 2,800 words (about 14 minutes of reading), uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for audio listening, and avoids jargon while explaining concepts from first principles.
