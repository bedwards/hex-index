<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEAL_selection_and_training">Wikipedia: United States Navy SEAL selection and training</a></p>

<p>There's a brass bell on a pole at the Naval Special Warfare Center in Coronado, California. When you can't take it anymore—when the cold Pacific has soaked through to your bones, when your lungs are screaming, when every muscle fiber is begging you to stop—you walk over to that bell, drop your helmet liner at its base, and ring it three times. That's it. You're done. The sound carries across the training grounds, a signal to everyone that another candidate has chosen comfort over completion.</p>

<p>Most people who attempt to become Navy SEALs ring that bell.</p>

<p>The Sea, Air, and Land Teams—that's what SEAL stands for—represent the United States Navy's primary special operations force. But here's what most people don't realize: the actual combat deployments that SEALs become famous for represent only a fraction of their career. The vast majority of a SEAL's professional life is consumed by training. Before a newly minted SEAL ever sees combat, they will have spent well over a year in formal training schools. And once they join an operational team, they'll train for another eighteen months before their first six-month deployment.</p>

<p>This is a profession where preparation is the product.</p>

<h2>Who Can Even Apply</h2>

<p>Let's start with the basics. To volunteer for SEAL training, you must be an American citizen between eighteen and twenty-nine years old, currently serving in the United States Navy. Seventeen-year-olds can apply with parental permission. Those who are twenty-nine or thirty can request a waiver, though approval is case-by-case. You need the equivalent of a high school education and must score at least 220 on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery—the ASVAB—which is the military's standardized test for measuring cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>Your eyes must be correctable to 20/25, even if your natural vision is as poor as 20/70. You cannot have a recent history of drug abuse. And you must demonstrate what the Navy delicately calls "good moral character," which they assess by examining your criminal record and civil citations.</p>

<p>Since December 2015, women have been eligible to enter the SEAL training pipeline, provided they meet the same standards as male candidates. The policy sounds straightforward on paper, but the reality has been more complex. The first woman to enter the pipeline dropped out during the initial three-week orientation phase in August 2017—before BUD/S even began. In 2019, a woman completed the screening required to enter BUD/S itself, but she was subsequently assigned to a different unit, one she had listed as her first choice over the SEALs.</p>

<p>The milestone that generated the most attention came on July 15, 2021, when the first woman graduated from the Naval Special Warfare training pipeline. She became a Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewman—known as SWCC—rather than a SEAL. These are the elite boat operators who transport SEAL teams and provide fire support. She was one of seventeen graduates that day.</p>

<h2>The Physical Screening Test</h2>

<p>Before you can even attempt SEAL training, you must pass the Physical Screening Test, commonly called the PST. The Navy publishes minimum requirements, but candidates who merely meet the minimums rarely succeed. The competitive standards tell the real story.</p>

<p>The swim comes first: five hundred yards using either the breaststroke or the combat sidestroke. The minimum time is twelve minutes and thirty seconds. The competitive time is nine minutes or less. That's a significant gap—candidates who take twelve minutes aren't really in the running.</p>

<p>Next come push-ups: at least fifty in two minutes, though competitive candidates hit ninety or more. Then sit-ups under the same time constraint, with the same competitive threshold. Pull-ups from a dead hang have no time limit, requiring a minimum of ten, but competitors pull off eighteen or more.</p>

<p>Finally, a mile-and-a-half run. Originally conducted in boots and pants, the test now uses shorts and sneakers. The minimum is ten minutes and thirty seconds. Competitors finish in nine and a half minutes or less.</p>

<p>If you meet these standards, you earn the privilege of attending Preparatory School.</p>

<h2>Naval Special Warfare Preparatory School</h2>

<p>Located in San Diego, Prep School exists for one purpose: to determine whether candidates are physically ready for the punishment of BUD/S. Think of it as a crash course in suffering, designed to elevate your fitness from "impressive civilian" to "potential SEAL candidate."</p>

<p>The school begins with the standard PST and ends with something harder—the Modified Physical Screening Test. Now you need seventy push-ups in two minutes instead of fifty. Now you run four miles in thirty-one minutes instead of a mile and a half. Now you swim a thousand meters with fins in twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Those who cannot pass the modified test are removed from the SEAL pipeline and reclassified into other Navy jobs. They don't get to try BUD/S. They simply get reassigned.</p>

<h2>Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training</h2>

<p>BUD/S is the crucible. It's twenty-four weeks of physical and mental punishment designed to identify which candidates possess the stamina, leadership ability, and psychological resilience to operate as SEALs. Officers and enlisted sailors train side by side, facing identical challenges. This isn't theoretical—a newly commissioned ensign and an enlisted seaman will be shivering in the same surf, carrying the same boat, failing or succeeding together.</p>

<p>The structure is straightforward: a three-week orientation followed by three phases of seven weeks each. Physical conditioning. Combat diving. Land warfare.</p>

<p>But the structure doesn't capture the experience.</p>

<h3>Orientation: Learning the Language of Pain</h3>

<p>Previously called Indoctrination—or "Indoc"—this two-week phase introduces candidates to what their lives will look like for the next six months. SEAL instructors demonstrate the physical training routines, the obstacle course, the swimming techniques. Everything is designed to prepare candidates for day one of First Phase, which is really just day one of a much longer ordeal.</p>

<h3>First Phase: Physical Conditioning</h3>

<p>The first phase tests physical conditioning, water competency, teamwork, and mental toughness. Every day includes running, swimming, and calisthenics. Every week includes timed runs of four miles in shorts and sneakers, timed obstacle courses, and ocean swims up to two miles wearing fins. Candidates who consistently fail to meet time requirements are dropped.</p>

<p>Candidates are organized into "boat crews" of six or seven people, each assigned a small inflatable boat called an IBS—Inflatable Boat, Small. These crews must paddle their boats through the surf zone and back, working as a unit. The boats aren't heavy by themselves, but try carrying one over your head while exhausted, cold, and sandy, coordinating with six other people who are equally miserable.</p>

<p>The first three weeks of conditioning exist primarily to prepare candidates for week four.</p>

<p>Hell Week.</p>

<h3>Hell Week</h3>

<p>The name isn't hyperbole. Over five and a half continuous days, candidates sleep a maximum of four hours total—not per night, total. They run more than two hundred miles. They perform physical training for more than twenty hours each day. They are constantly wet, constantly cold, constantly exhausted.</p>

<p>Here's what surprises some people: candidates are not starved. They receive breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The Navy has learned that adding nutritional deprivation to sleep deprivation, hypothermia, and physical exhaustion pushes the body past the point of useful stress into genuine medical danger. The goal is to break candidates mentally, not to hospitalize them.</p>

<p>Although hospitalization does happen.</p>

<p>On February 4, 2022, shortly after completing Hell Week, two sailors began reporting symptoms. They were immediately taken to a local hospital. One was pronounced dead after arriving. No cause of death was publicly reported. The second sailor was admitted in stable condition, but no cause of illness or injury was disclosed. These deaths, while rare, have made BUD/S controversial, particularly combined with documented cases of candidates using performance-enhancing drugs.</p>

<p>After Hell Week, the remaining three weeks of First Phase involve hydrographic surveys—learning to create charts of coastal waters—while continuing timed runs and swim tests. By this point, most candidates who were going to quit have already quit.</p>

<p>The tradition is simple. You drop your helmet liner by the pole. You ring the bell three times. You walk away.</p>

<h3>Second Phase: Combat Diving</h3>

<p>The diving phase transforms candidates into basic combat swimmers. This is what distinguishes SEALs from other American special operations forces—the emphasis on underwater infiltration as a primary means of reaching combat objectives.</p>

<p>Physical training intensifies even as academic demands increase. Candidates study dive physics and dive medicine. They learn two types of SCUBA: open circuit, which uses compressed air and produces bubbles, and closed circuit, which recycles breathing gas and produces no visible signature. The closed-circuit systems allow SEALs to approach targets underwater without detection.</p>

<p>The emphasis throughout is on long-distance underwater movement. Swimming and diving become transportation—the means of getting from a submarine or boat to an enemy position without being seen.</p>

<p>By the end of Second Phase, candidates must complete a two-mile swim with fins in eighty minutes, a four-mile run with boots in thirty-one minutes, and both a three-and-a-half-mile and a five-and-a-half-mile swim. Successful candidates demonstrate what the Navy calls "a high level of comfort in the water"—which is a polite way of describing the ability to remain calm while exhausted, disoriented, and submerged.</p>

<h3>Third Phase: Land Warfare</h3>

<p>The final phase shifts from water to land. Candidates learn weapons handling, demolitions, land navigation, patrolling techniques, rappelling, marksmanship, infantry tactics, and small-unit tactics. There's more classroom work than in previous phases—maps, compasses, weapon systems.</p>

<p>For most candidates, much of this material is new. The learning pace accelerates continuously.</p>

<p>The last five weeks take place on San Clemente Island, about sixty miles from Coronado. Here, candidates practice everything they've learned under conditions designed to mirror actual operations. Training runs seven days a week. Sleep becomes minimal. And for the first time, candidates handle live explosives and ammunition.</p>

<p>Instructor scrutiny reaches its peak. Punishments are at their harshest. Many candidates who survived Hell Week consider San Clemente the hardest part of their training—not because of any single event, but because of the relentless accumulation of pressure over weeks.</p>

<p>By the end of Third Phase, candidates must complete a two-mile ocean swim with fins in seventy-five minutes (five minutes faster than Second Phase), a four-mile run with boots in thirty minutes (one minute faster), and a fourteen-mile run.</p>

<h2>Parachute Training</h2>

<p>Graduates of BUD/S proceed to Tactical Air Operations in San Diego for three weeks of jump school. The program covers both static line jumps—where the parachute deploys automatically when you exit the aircraft—and free-fall jumps, where the jumper controls deployment.</p>

<p>The course progresses through increasingly complex scenarios: basic static line, accelerated free fall, combat equipment jumps, and finally night descents with combat equipment from at least 9,500 feet.</p>

<p>The program is described as "highly regimented" and designed to produce "safe and competent free-fall jumpers in a short period of time." That phrase—"safe and competent"—is notable. This isn't training to become an expert skydiver. It's training to use parachutes as a tactical insertion method.</p>

<h2>SEAL Qualification Training</h2>

<p>BUD/S identifies who can become a SEAL. SQT—SEAL Qualification Training—actually creates SEALs.</p>

<p>This twenty-six-week course advances candidates from elementary competence to tactical readiness. The curriculum includes weapons training, close-quarters combat, small unit tactics, land navigation, demolitions, unarmed combat, medical skills, and maritime operations. Candidates travel to Kodiak, Alaska for cold weather training. They attend Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Training—SERE—learning to survive if captured.</p>

<p>Graduation from SQT marks the moment of transformation. Candidates receive the Navy SEAL Trident—the distinctive gold insignia depicting an eagle clutching a trident, pistol, and anchor. They're granted their official classifications: NEC 5326 Combatant Swimmer (SEAL) for enlisted sailors, or 1130 Special Warfare Officer for commissioned officers.</p>

<p>They are now, officially, Navy SEALs.</p>

<p>And their training has just begun.</p>

<h2>The Medical Requirement</h2>

<p>Here's something that often gets overlooked: every SEAL must complete a six-month medical course. The Special Operations Tactical Medic course in Stennis, Mississippi trains all sailors selected by Naval Special Warfare Command. Graduates earn the designation Naval Special Warfare Medic.</p>

<p>This isn't optional. You cannot join an operational SEAL team without completing it. The reasoning is practical—SEAL teams operate in small units, far from conventional medical support. Every team member needs substantial trauma medicine capability.</p>

<h2>Pre-Deployment Training</h2>

<p>New SEALs receive orders to a SEAL Team, either at Coronado, California or Little Creek, Virginia. They're assigned to a Troop and a subordinate Platoon. Then begins the pre-deployment workup—a twelve to eighteen-month cycle divided into three phases.</p>

<h3>Individual Specialty Training</h3>

<p>The first six months focus on individual skills. Operators attend various schools and courses based on their team's needs. The list of possible specialties is extensive:</p>

<p>Sniper training, either through the SEAL Sniper Course or the Marine Corps Scout Sniper Course. Advanced close-quarters combat and breaching—learning to get through doors, walls, and other barriers. Surreptitious entry, which means bypassing locks and electronic security systems without detection. Advanced combat medicine. The Naval Special Warfare Combat Fighting Course. Technical surveillance operations. Advanced driving skills including defensive, rally, and protective security driving. Climbing and rope skills. Jumpmaster certification or parachute rigger qualification. Diving supervisor or diving maintenance credentials. Range safety officer certification. Advanced demolitions. High-threat protective security for heads of state or high-value persons. Instructor school. Unmanned aerial vehicle operation. Language school.</p>

<p>No individual SEAL masters all of these. But collectively, a platoon needs operators with these capabilities distributed across its members.</p>

<h3>Unit Level Training</h3>

<p>The second six months, called Unit Level Training or ULT, brings the troop and platoon together to train in core mission skills. Small unit tactics. Land warfare. Close quarters combat. Urban warfare. Maritime interdiction—boarding vessels at sea. Combat swimming. Long-range target interdiction, which typically means sniper operations. Air operations from both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Special reconnaissance.</p>

<p>This phase is run by the training detachments of Naval Special Warfare Group 1 or Group 2, depending on which coast the team is based.</p>

<h3>Task Group Level Training</h3>

<p>The final six months integrate the SEAL troop with all the supporting elements that will deploy together: Special Boat Teams—the SWCC operators who handle maritime transportation. Intelligence teams. Cryptological support teams for signals intelligence. Communications teams. Medical teams. Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialists. Interpreters and linguists.</p>

<p>A final Certification Exercise—CERTEX—synchronizes the entire SEAL Squadron's operations under simulated Joint Special Operations Task Force conditions. Pass CERTEX, and the SEAL Team becomes a SEAL Squadron, certified for deployment.</p>

<h2>Deployment and Beyond</h2>

<p>A certified SEAL Squadron deploys to a Joint Special Operations Task Force or a designated Area of Responsibility. They become a Special Operations Task Force, integrating with Joint Task Forces in support of national objectives. Troops receive specific Areas of Operations where they either work as intact units or break into smaller elements—platoons of twenty, squads of ten, teams of five—depending on mission requirements.</p>

<p>Then, after six months of deployment, they return home. The cycle begins again. Training. Specialization. Integration. Certification. Deployment.</p>

<p>This is the rhythm of a SEAL's career—not the dramatic raids that make headlines, but the endless preparation that makes those raids possible.</p>

<h2>The Numbers</h2>

<p>What does all this training produce? Consider the timeline for a new recruit:</p>

<p>Boot camp. SEAL Preparatory School. Twenty-four weeks of BUD/S. Three weeks of parachute training. Twenty-six weeks of SEAL Qualification Training. Six months of combat medic training. Six months of individual specialty training. Six months of unit level training. Six months of task group training and certification.</p>

<p>That's roughly three years from enlistment to first deployment.</p>

<p>And the attrition? The exact numbers vary by class, but historically, somewhere between seventy and eighty percent of candidates who begin BUD/S do not complete it. Some fail physical standards. Some are injured. Many simply decide they've had enough and ring the bell.</p>

<p>The bell is always there. Three rings, and you're done.</p>

<p>The SEALs who make it past that bell—who endure Hell Week and San Clemente Island and all the phases that follow—represent a tiny fraction of those who volunteer. They've proven they can function under conditions designed to make functioning impossible. They've demonstrated that they won't quit when every cell in their body is begging them to.</p>

<p>Whether that proves anything about combat effectiveness is a question the military continues to study. What it certainly proves is a capacity to endure what most people cannot imagine enduring, and to do it while performing complex tasks requiring precision and judgment.</p>

<p>The bell is always an option. Most people take it. The ones who don't become SEALs.</p>
