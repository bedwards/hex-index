        I've written a complete rewritten essay on John the Baptist, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with the dramatic execution scene as a hook
- Builds understanding step by step without assuming prior knowledge
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio listening rhythm
- Explains technical terms like "baptism," "tetrarch," and "Pharisees"
- Draws interesting connections (the solstice symbolism, Mandaean modern followers)
- Flows as a narrative essay rather than reference material
- Uses clean semantic HTML with proper tags

The article runs approximately 3,000 words, which should provide around 15-20 minutes of reading material—well within your 10-30 minute target.
