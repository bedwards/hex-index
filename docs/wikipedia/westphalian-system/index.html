<h2>The Agreement That Invented Countries</h2>

<p>In 1648, after thirty years of religious warfare had killed nearly a third of Germany's population, exhausted diplomats gathered to sign a peace treaty. They had no idea they were about to invent the modern world.</p>

<p>The Peace of Westphalia wasn't just another treaty ending another war. It established a revolutionary principle that still governs international relations today: no country gets to tell another country what to do inside its own borders. Your territory, your rules. This idea—called Westphalian sovereignty—is so deeply embedded in how we think about nations that it's hard to imagine a world without it.</p>

<p>But such a world existed for centuries. And understanding what came before helps explain why this principle mattered so much, and why it's now under attack from multiple directions.</p>

<h2>Before Westphalia: One Big Christian Family (That Constantly Fought)</h2>

<p>Medieval Europe operated on a completely different theory of political organization. The continent was supposed to be a unified Christian commonwealth, spiritually governed by the Pope in Rome and temporally governed by whoever held the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Kings and princes existed, certainly, but they theoretically owed allegiance to these higher authorities.</p>

<p>This system was always more aspirational than real. Popes and emperors constantly squabbled over who outranked whom. Local rulers ignored both when it suited them. But the underlying assumption persisted: Christendom was one family, and the father figures had the right to intervene in family disputes.</p>

<p>Then came the Protestant Reformation.</p>

<p>When Martin Luther nailed his theses to that church door in 1517, he didn't just launch a theological debate. He shattered the ideological foundation of European political order. Suddenly, large parts of Europe no longer recognized the Pope's spiritual authority. If you're a Protestant prince, why would you accept that the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor—backed by the even more Catholic Habsburg dynasty—has any right to tell you how to run your territory?</p>

<p>The result was catastrophic violence.</p>

<h2>The War That Broke Europe</h2>

<p>The Thirty Years' War began in 1618 when Protestant nobles in Bohemia threw two Catholic imperial governors out of a window in Prague. They survived by landing in a pile of manure—yes, really—but the incident sparked three decades of carnage that would devastate central Europe.</p>

<p>Calling it a "religious war" captures only part of the picture. France, though Catholic, backed the Protestants to weaken the Habsburgs. Sweden invaded German territories for a complex mix of religious, strategic, and frankly commercial reasons. Mercenary armies ravaged the countryside regardless of which side paid them. Famine and plague followed in their wake.</p>

<p>By the time the fighting ended, some German regions had lost sixty percent of their population. Entire cities simply ceased to exist. The social fabric of central Europe lay in ruins.</p>

<p>Out of this apocalypse came the treaties we now call the Peace of Westphalia.</p>

<h2>What the Treaties Actually Said</h2>

<p>Here's a historical irony: recent scholarship has convincingly argued that the 1648 treaties didn't actually articulate the principles we now attribute to them.</p>

<p>The diplomatic historian Andreas Osiander examined the treaty texts carefully and found something surprising. The documents never mention "sovereignty" as a general principle. They don't proclaim non-intervention as a universal rule. They don't assert the legal equality of all states. What they mostly do is settle specific territorial disputes, adjust the balance of power between the Habsburgs and their rivals, and establish a messy compromise on religious practice within the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>Some scholars have pointed out that the treaties actually limited sovereignty in many ways. Smaller German states remained subordinate to imperial structures. Religious minorities received protections that constrained what rulers could do within their own territories. The whole settlement depended on France and Sweden acting as guarantors—meaning they retained the right to intervene if the terms were violated.</p>

<p>So why do we call the modern state system "Westphalian" if Westphalia didn't really create it?</p>

<p>Because ideas evolve. The practical compromise of 1648—which basically said "we'll stop trying to impose religious uniformity on each other because it's too costly"—gradually transformed into a broader principle. Over the following century and a half, thinkers and diplomats built on the Westphalian foundation. The Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel, writing in the mid-1700s, developed the non-intervention principle into something close to its modern form.</p>

<p>By the nineteenth century, the Westphalian system had reached its mature expression.</p>

<h2>The Golden Age of Sovereignty</h2>

<p>Between roughly 1850 and 1900, the principle that states should not meddle in each other's internal affairs enjoyed unusual respect. This was also the era when nationalism became the dominant political ideology. The idea took hold that legitimate states should correspond to nations—groups of people united by language, culture, and shared history. Each nation deserved its own sovereign state, and each sovereign state represented its nation.</p>

<p>This sounds obvious to modern ears. It wasn't. For most of history, political units formed through conquest, marriage, inheritance, and accident. The idea that political borders should align with cultural boundaries was revolutionary. It's also proven incredibly difficult to implement, given that human populations stubbornly refuse to sort themselves into neat geographic categories.</p>

<p>The late nineteenth-century system had another crucial feature: the absorption of cities into states. Before Westphalia, city-states and commercial leagues operated as independent actors in international politics. The Hanseatic League, Venice, the free cities of the Holy Roman Empire—these were players in their own right. The Westphalian system subordinated them to territorial states. You were either a state or you were part of a state. No other category mattered.</p>

<p>This model spread globally. European colonizers exported the state form to every corner of the planet. When colonies gained independence in the twentieth century, they adopted the same organizing principle. The United Nations, founded in 1945, enshrined Westphalian sovereignty in its charter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The system seemed triumphant. It was about to face its greatest challenges.</p>

<h2>The Humanitarian Intervention Dilemma</h2>

<p>What happens when a government massacres its own people?</p>

<p>Under strict Westphalian logic, the answer is nothing—at least not from outside. A state's treatment of its own citizens is a domestic matter. Other countries have no right to intervene, however horrific the situation.</p>

<p>This position became increasingly difficult to maintain after the Holocaust. The Nuremberg trials established that some crimes—genocide, crimes against humanity—were so severe that the international community could hold individuals accountable regardless of state sovereignty. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 proclaimed that human beings possessed rights that no government could legitimately violate.</p>

<p>A tension emerged that remains unresolved today. On one hand, sovereignty protects weak states from domination by strong ones. On the other hand, sovereignty can shield perpetrators of atrocities from any meaningful response.</p>

<p>This tension exploded into open debate after the Cold War ended.</p>

<h2>The Post-Cold War Challenge</h2>

<p>The 1990s saw a wave of interventions justified on humanitarian grounds. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization—NATO—bombed Serbia to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. UN peacekeepers deployed to failed states around the world. A new doctrine emerged: the "responsibility to protect," which held that sovereignty was contingent on a state's treatment of its own population.</p>

<p>Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, gave a famous speech in Chicago in 1999 explicitly calling for a "post-Westphalian" international order. He argued that globalization had made the old system obsolete. In an interconnected world, crises anywhere threatened stability everywhere. The international community had both the right and the duty to intervene against rogue regimes.</p>

<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana put it bluntly: "humanity and democracy" were "essentially irrelevant to the original Westphalian order." The system had produced rivalry instead of community, exclusion instead of integration. It was time for something new.</p>

<p>Germany's Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made similar arguments, calling for European integration to transcend the Westphalian balance-of-power logic that had produced two devastating world wars. The European Union itself embodied a challenge to traditional sovereignty—member states accepted interference in their internal affairs from supranational institutions in Brussels.</p>

<h2>The Backlash: Sovereignty's Defenders</h2>

<p>Not everyone embraced this vision. Critics pointed out that humanitarian intervention looked suspiciously like colonialism wearing new clothes. After all, European powers had always justified imperial conquest with civilizing rhetoric. They were bringing Christianity, or commerce, or civilization, or human rights. The specific justification changed; the pattern of powerful states imposing their will on weaker ones remained constant.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most forceful defenders of Westphalian sovereignty today are Russia and China.</p>

<p>In 2001, Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a joint statement vowing to "counter attempts to undermine the fundamental norms of international law with the help of concepts such as 'humanitarian intervention' and 'limited sovereignty.'" Both governments have used their veto power on the United Nations Security Council to block interventions they see as American imperialism dressed up in humanitarian language.</p>

<p>There's an irony here. Russia was actually excluded from the original Westphalian settlement in 1648—it wasn't yet considered part of the European state system. But post-Soviet Russia has embraced Westphalian sovereignty as a tool for resisting American hegemony and promoting a multipolar world order.</p>

<p>Even some Western voices urge caution about abandoning the Westphalian framework. The American political scientist Stephen Walt has argued that the United States would benefit from returning to Westphalian principles rather than pursuing endless interventions abroad. Respecting other countries' sovereignty, in this view, isn't just ethical—it's strategically sensible.</p>

<h2>The Digital Frontier</h2>

<p>Just as the debate over humanitarian intervention seemed to reach stalemate, a new challenge emerged: cyberspace.</p>

<p>The Westphalian system assumes that states have clear territorial boundaries. Your land, your water, your airspace—these are defined spaces where your sovereignty applies. But the internet has no borders. Data flows across jurisdictions instantaneously. A company headquartered in one country, with servers in a second country, serving users in a third country, might fall under three different legal systems—or arguably none of them.</p>

<p>Legal scholars have begun asking uncomfortable questions. Can we simply extend traditional sovereignty into the digital realm? Is cyberspace just another domain like land, sea, and air? Or does it require fundamentally different governance principles?</p>

<p>The problem is compounded by the role of private corporations. In the traditional Westphalian model, states are the only relevant actors in international affairs. But companies like Google, Meta, and Amazon wield power that rivals many nation-states. They create the infrastructure of the digital world. They establish and enforce rules governing billions of users. They collect data on a scale that governments can only envy.</p>

<p>Some scholars argue that we need a "Digital Westphalia"—a new settlement that establishes clear principles for governance in cyberspace. What would such a settlement look like? Who would negotiate it? Would states or corporations be the primary parties? These questions remain unanswered.</p>

<h2>The Fundamental Tension</h2>

<p>Nearly four centuries after those exhausted diplomats gathered to end the Thirty Years' War, their accidental invention continues to structure world politics. Every country on Earth claims Westphalian sovereignty. Every international organization, from the United Nations to the African Union, is built on the foundation of sovereign states.</p>

<p>Yet the system faces contradictions it may not be able to resolve.</p>

<p>Climate change respects no borders. Pandemics spread regardless of sovereignty. Financial crises cascade through an interconnected global economy. These problems require collective action that the Westphalian framework struggles to enable. If every state has absolute authority within its territory, how can we address challenges that are inherently transnational?</p>

<p>At the same time, proposals to supersede sovereignty trigger deep anxieties. Who decides what constitutes a humanitarian crisis severe enough to justify intervention? Who chooses which states are "failed" enough to lose their sovereignty protections? In practice, these judgments tend to be made by powerful countries about weaker ones. The pattern looks uncomfortably familiar to anyone who knows the history of colonialism.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most honest assessment is that Westphalian sovereignty was always more aspiration than reality. Powerful states have always found ways to intervene in weaker states when it suited their interests. The principle of non-interference provided a useful fiction that allowed for some degree of international stability. Whether that fiction can survive the pressures of the twenty-first century remains an open question.</p>

<h2>The War That Changed Everything</h2>

<p>In the end, we return to that devastated seventeenth-century landscape. Thirty years of religious war had proven that trying to impose one vision of truth on an entire continent produced only catastrophe. The Peace of Westphalia didn't resolve the underlying theological disputes. It simply took them off the table. Catholics remained Catholic. Protestants remained Protestant. And everyone agreed to stop killing each other over the difference.</p>

<p>That pragmatic compromise—we'll agree to disagree, and what happens inside your borders is your business—created the world we live in. Every passport, every embassy, every United Nations vote reflects the Westphalian settlement. When we speak of "national security" or "foreign policy," we're using concepts that didn't exist before 1648.</p>

<p>The diplomats who signed those treaties would be astonished to learn what they started. They were just trying to end a war. Instead, they invented the modern world.</p>
