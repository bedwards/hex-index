        I've written a rewritten version of the Universal Approximation Theorem Wikipedia article as an essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about neural networks being mathematically proven capable of learning "essentially anything"
- Explains concepts from first principles (what neural networks actually do, activation functions, etc.)
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms (ReLU, GeLU)
- Avoids jargon or explains it immediately
- Includes interesting connections like the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem and the compositionality parallel to linguistics
- Addresses the crucial distinction between existence and construction
- Uses semantic HTML markup throughout

The file is ready to write to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/universal-approximation-theorem/index.html` once you grant write permission.
