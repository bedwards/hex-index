        The essay has been written. Here's a summary of the rewritten Wikipedia article on Dhimmi:

**Key transformations made:**
- **Hook-first opening**: Started with the fascinating historical paradox of millions living "not as slaves, not as equals, but something in between" rather than a dictionary definition
- **Narrative flow**: Organized as a historical essay moving from origins through medieval practice to modern debates
- **Varied rhythm**: Mixed short punchy paragraphs ("This wasn't charity. It was a deal.") with longer explanatory sections
- **Plain language**: Explained technical terms like jizya, madhhabs, qadi, and ijtihad in context
- **Interesting connections**: Added comparisons to European treatment of Jews, Napoleon's Egypt invasion, and modern situations in Iran and Egypt
- **Relevant context**: Tied to the Substack article about Iran's Jewish population in the closing sections
- **Speechify-optimized**: No jargon without explanation, spelled out concepts from first principles, natural transitions throughout

**Length**: Approximately 2,800 words (~14 minutes reading time), providing substantial depth while remaining engaging.
