        I've written the essay rewriting the Wikipedia article on Metanoia (theology). The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. It:

- Opens with a hook about the translation problem rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for good audio rhythm
- Explains technical terms in plain language
- Traces the translation history from Greek through Latin to English
- Covers the Orthodox, Lutheran, and Calvinist perspectives
- Connects to modern neuroscience (neuroplasticity)
- Describes the physical practice of prostrations in Eastern churches
- Ends with a reflection on what Christianity might look like with the correct translation

The file needs to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/metanoia-theology/index.html`. I'm waiting for write permission to save it.
