        The essay has been prepared. Here's a summary of the rewritten article:

**Hyman Minsky: The Prophet of Financial Instability**

I've transformed the Wikipedia article into an engaging 3,500+ word essay (~18 min read) that:

- **Opens with a hook**: The 2008 crisis bringing a dead economist back to prominence
- **Explains the core paradox**: "Stability breeds instability" - success changes behavior in ways that make systems fragile
- **Breaks down the three borrower types** (hedge, speculative, Ponzi) with clear explanations and real-world mortgage examples
- **Traces the three phases of the credit cycle** and how they lead inevitably to crisis
- **Connects to the 2008 subprime crisis** through Paul McCulley's analysis
- **Covers Minsky's four stages of capitalism** from commercial through money manager capitalism
- **Explains why he was ignored** and why his ideas suddenly became essential in 2008
- **Ends with the unsettling truth**: Prevention must happen during good times, when nobody wants to hear warnings

The essay is optimized for Speechify with:
- Varied sentence and paragraph lengths
- No jargon without explanation
- Clean semantic HTML markup
- Natural narrative flow rather than encyclopedic listing

This connects well to the linked Substack article about AI bubbles - Minsky's framework is directly applicable to understanding speculative investment cycles in technology.
