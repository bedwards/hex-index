        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about Nelumbo nucifera (the sacred lotus). The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I've done:

**Structure and hooks:**
- Opens with the fascinating discovery that lotus flowers regulate their own temperature like warm-blooded animals
- Follows with the incredible story of 1,300-year-old seeds germinating
- Clarifies the common confusion between lotus and water lilies early on

**Key sections cover:**
- The plant's thermoregulation abilities
- Extreme seed longevity and survival strategy
- Taxonomic distinctions from water lilies
- Plant architecture (rhizomes, leaves, flowers)
- Religious and spiritual significance across Hinduism, Buddhism, and other traditions
- Culinary uses across Asia
- Bioactive compounds and chemistry
- Cultivation requirements and techniques
- Geographic distribution (India's national flower)
- The American lotus relative
- Bowl lotus for home cultivation
- Etymology of the scientific and Sanskrit names
- Global lotus industry centered in China

**Writing style features:**
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio rhythm
- Technical terms explained immediately (rhizome, petiole, alkaloids, etc.)
- Interesting connections (lotus effect inspiring water-repellent coatings, genetic relationship to sycamores)
- Concrete comparisons (rhizome extends "the length of a bowling lane," flower "the size of a dinner plate")
- Narrative flow rather than encyclopedia-style bullet points
