        I've prepared the rewritten Wikipedia article on morphogens. The content transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading with Speechify.

Key features of the rewrite:

**Opening hook**: Instead of starting with a dry definition, it opens with the fascinating question of how a single cell knows how to build a complex organism.

**Narrative structure**: The essay flows from Alan Turing's prescient 1952 prediction through the discovery of Bicoid to modern understanding of morphogen families.

**Varied paragraph lengths**: Short punchy paragraphs ("This is how patterns emerge from uniformity.") mixed with longer explanatory ones.

**Explained technical terms**: Syncytium, transcription factors, enhancers, endocytosis—all explained in plain language when introduced.

**Interesting connections**: Added context about vitamin A warnings during pregnancy, the naming of Sonic Hedgehog after the video game character, and the beetle genus named after morphogens.

**Human-relevant examples**: How your spinal cord develops, why your forearm hairs all point one direction, holoprosencephaly disease.

The article runs approximately 2,500 words, suitable for an 18-minute read/listen. The HTML follows the existing template structure in the docs/wikipedia folder.
