        I've written a comprehensive essay on ranked-choice voting in the United States, transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the 2018 Maine election
- Explains the difference between instant-runoff voting and single transferable vote
- Traces the century-long history of these systems in America
- Covers the key modern experiments in Maine and Alaska in narrative detail
- Addresses both adoption and the wave of bans
- Explores lesser-known applications like overseas military voters and party primaries
- Concludes with the philosophical question underlying the debate

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for audio listening, spells out concepts from first principles, and maintains narrative flow throughout. It runs approximately 3,200 words, providing about 15-20 minutes of reading material.
