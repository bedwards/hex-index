<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi-brousse">Wikipedia: Share taxi</a></p>

<p>In the 1940s, conductors on Ghana's crowded minibuses would shout "tro tro"—threepence, threepence—as they collected fares from passengers. Eight decades later, that call has become the name for an entire transportation ecosystem. The tro tro is just one incarnation of a global phenomenon that goes by dozens of names: taxi-brousse in Madagascar, marshrutka in Russia, dala dala in Tanzania, danfo in Lagos, fula fula in Kinshasa, sotrama in Mali. In the United States, you might call it a jitney or dollar van.</p>

<p>These are share taxis—vehicles that exist in the fascinating gray zone between a private cab and a public bus.</p>

<h2>Neither Fish Nor Fowl</h2>

<p>What makes a share taxi different from an ordinary taxi? You don't have it to yourself. What makes it different from a bus? There's no schedule, often no fixed stops, and sometimes the driver won't leave until every seat is full.</p>

<p>This in-between status is precisely what makes share taxis so adaptable. They fill gaps that formal transit systems leave behind. In cities where buses are expensive, unreliable, or simply nonexistent, share taxis emerge organically to meet demand. They're a market solution to a mobility problem, arising not from government planning but from entrepreneurs who own a vehicle and see an opportunity.</p>

<p>The vehicles themselves vary wildly. In Morocco, intercity share taxis are often old full-size Mercedes-Benz sedans that somehow accommodate six passengers. In South Africa, they're 16-seat minibuses called kombis, or more specifically "quantums" when they're Toyota HiAces. In Ethiopia, the blue-and-white HiAces technically seat eleven, but they'll always make room for one more until physical reality intervenes. Elsewhere you'll find covered pickup trucks with benches in the bed, station wagons, or proper midibuses.</p>

<h2>The Economics of Waiting</h2>

<p>Here's where share taxis diverge most dramatically from conventional transit: the departure time isn't printed on any schedule. In many African cities, the minibus simply waits at its terminus until every seat is occupied. During rush hour, this happens quickly. During off-peak times, passengers might sit for over an hour, watching the driver scan the street for approaching customers, the conductor calling out destinations to pedestrians.</p>

<p>This waiting game creates a particular kind of urban patience. Passengers accept it because the alternative—paying full taxi fare or waiting even longer for an unreliable bus—is worse. Drivers accept it because departing with empty seats means losing money on fuel for an unprofitable trip.</p>

<p>Once moving, the share taxi follows a semi-fixed route. The driver knows roughly where to go but can improvise based on traffic or passenger requests. You can usually flag one down anywhere along its path and ask to be dropped anywhere too—a flexibility that buses rarely offer.</p>

<h2>Who Runs the Routes?</h2>

<p>The ownership structures of share taxis reveal much about how informal economies organize themselves. Some operations are corporate. In Dakar, Senegal, company-owned fleets of hundreds of colorful vehicles called car rapides ply the streets. In the Soviet Union, marshrutka services were run by state-owned taxi parks, a system that persisted into the post-Soviet era as private operators took over the familiar routes.</p>

<p>But individual ownership is more common, especially in Africa. An entrepreneur buys a minibus—or two at most—and rents it to a driver who pays for fuel and keeps whatever revenue remains. The driver, in turn, employs a conductor: the weyala in Ethiopia, the mpigadebe in Tanzania, the mate in Ghana. This conductor collects fares, calls out destinations, and manages the complex social dynamics of a crowded vehicle.</p>

<p>The mpigadebe's title deserves explanation. It literally means "a person who hits a debe"—a debe being a four-gallon tin container. The name comes from the practice of conductors banging on the roof and sides of the van to attract passengers and signal the driver when to depart. It's percussion as communication.</p>

<h2>The Syndicates</h2>

<p>In the absence of government regulation, someone has to impose order. That role often falls to syndicates—associations of drivers and owners that function as informal regulatory bodies. In Hong Kong, Lagos, Accra, and countless other cities, these syndicates set routes, manage terminals, collect membership dues, and sometimes fix fares.</p>

<p>This sounds benign enough. But syndicates represent owners, not passengers, and their incentives don't always align with rider convenience. Researchers have documented a phenomenon called "terminal constraint," where syndicates force passengers to board and disembark only at designated terminals—even when those locations are inconvenient—because the syndicates control those terminals and can collect fees from drivers who use them.</p>

<p>The syndicates also ensure each vehicle leaves full, which benefits the driver's economics but not the passenger's schedule. If you arrive at a terminus during a slow period, you wait. The system prioritizes operational efficiency over individual time.</p>

<h2>The South African Exception</h2>

<p>South Africa's share taxi industry took a darker turn than most. Over sixty percent of South African commuters rely on minibus taxis, making this a genuinely mass-transit system. But the history is violent.</p>

<p>Before 1987, the taxi industry was tightly regulated, and under apartheid, Black operators were systematically denied permits. All minibus taxi operations run by Black South Africans were, by definition, illegal. When the industry was rapidly deregulated after 1987, a flood of new operators rushed in to meet the pent-up demand.</p>

<p>What followed was catastrophic. Taxi operators formed associations that soon devolved into territorial gangs. Without effective regulation—and with official regulatory bodies thoroughly corrupt—these associations engaged in price-fixing, hired hitmen, and waged open warfare over routes and passengers. During the height of the conflict, taxi drivers commonly carried shotguns and AK-47s. They shot rival drivers and their passengers on sight.</p>

<p>The government has since instituted a recapitalization scheme, replacing dangerous old vehicles with new eighteen- and thirty-five-seat minibuses that carry the South African flag. The violence has subsided, but the memory shapes how South Africans think about their daily commute.</p>

<h2>Why They Persist</h2>

<p>Some urban economists, particularly libertarian thinkers like Richard Allen Epstein at the University of Chicago, argue that share taxis represent a "market-friendly" alternative to public transportation. When formal transit fails—too expensive, too infrequent, too limited in coverage—the share taxi emerges to fill the gap. This is spontaneous order in action.</p>

<p>But this framing obscures important trade-offs. Share taxis are difficult to tax, which means they contribute little to public infrastructure. They often operate in regulatory vacuums, which can mean unsafe vehicles, uninsured passengers, and unpredictable service. They're a market response to government failure, but they also make government planning harder by competing with formal transit on lucrative routes while ignoring unprofitable ones.</p>

<p>In Manila and Jakarta, share taxis dominate partly because public transit alternatives simply don't exist at sufficient scale. When bus fares rise, share taxi usage spikes. They're the transit system of last resort and, for millions, the transit system of everyday life.</p>

<h2>Names as Cultural Artifacts</h2>

<p>The local names for share taxis tell small stories. "Fula fula" in Kinshasa means "quick quick"—an aspiration more than a description, given traffic. "Kia kia" in Nigeria's Yorubaland means the same thing. "Twegerane" in Rwanda translates to something like "stuffed" or "full," an honest assessment of the typical passenger experience.</p>

<p>"Taxi-brousse"—the term used in Madagascar and other Francophone African countries—literally means "bush taxi," suggesting travel through rural terrain between towns. The English rendering sometimes uses a space ("taxi brousse") rather than the French hyphen.</p>

<p>The Egyptian term "mashru" (مشروع) means "project," which is curious. The other Egyptian term, "mekrobass" (ميكروباصات), is simply a transliteration of "micro-bus," the same borrowing that happened across much of the former Soviet sphere with "marshrutka" (from the German "marschroute," meaning fixed route).</p>

<h2>Hand Signals and Hidden Knowledge</h2>

<p>In Egypt, prospective passengers use well-established hand signals to indicate their destination to passing micro-buses. These signals constitute a kind of tacit knowledge that locals absorb and outsiders struggle to decode. You stand at the roadside, make a gesture, and drivers who are heading your way slow down. It's public transit as folk practice.</p>

<p>Ethiopian minibuses are more straightforward—they're the standard blue-and-white HiAces that fill Addis Ababa's streets. You can spot your route by the conductor hanging out the door, shouting destinations. A fleet of about 350 larger buses also operates in the city, but the minibuses remain dominant because they go more places more frequently.</p>

<h2>Regulation's Uneven Reach</h2>

<p>The relationship between share taxis and government varies enormously by country and city. In Kenya, regulation extends to operators and their routes, not just the vehicles themselves. In Ghana, tro tros are licensed by the government, but the industry effectively self-regulates through syndicates like the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) and PROTOA.</p>

<p>Lagos, Nigeria, has a dedicated transport regulator—the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Agency (LAMATA)—and syndicates like the National Union of Road and Transport Workers (NURTW) operate within that framework. But many African cities, as of recent studies, have no independent transport authority at all. Kinshasa didn't have one. Neither did Douala in Cameroon, nor Bamako in Mali, nor Accra in Ghana.</p>

<p>This regulatory patchwork creates odd situations. In Cameroon, minibuses are actually prohibited from operating as share taxis by law—though other share taxi forms persist. In Algeria, the government officially discourages using taxis collectifs, with foreign affairs ministries advising travelers to use hotel-recommended taxis instead. Yet the taxis collectifs continue operating, waiting at stations until full, taking passengers between towns.</p>

<h2>The Pandemic Test</h2>

<p>COVID-19 provided an unexpected natural experiment in share taxi regulation. In Ghana, authorities imposed social distancing guidelines on tro tros. The results were surprising: ninety-eight percent compliance with physical distancing requirements. The industry, nominally self-regulated and often described as chaotic, proved capable of organized behavior when the stakes were clear.</p>

<p>Guidelines on face masks were harder to enforce—individual compliance is always trickier than rules about spacing and capacity. But the pandemic showed that share taxi systems, for all their informality, can respond to coordinated public health measures.</p>

<h2>The Full Load Logic</h2>

<p>There's an elegant economic logic to the share taxi model. The driver needs revenue from a full vehicle to cover fuel costs and turn a profit. Passengers need affordable transport. The terminus wait, annoying as it is, aligns these interests. Everyone pays less because everyone shares the ride.</p>

<p>This is why formal bus systems often can't compete on popular routes. They run on schedules regardless of demand, which means sometimes they're empty and losing money, sometimes they're packed and passengers are left behind. The share taxi's flexibility—wait until full, go anywhere, stop anywhere—adapts to demand in real time.</p>

<p>But that flexibility has costs. No schedules mean no predictability. Self-interested syndicates mean inconvenient terminals. Owner-operators competing fiercely mean sometimes, as in South Africa, literal warfare. The share taxi solves one problem—mass mobility in underserved areas—while creating others.</p>

<h2>A World of Adaptations</h2>

<p>The share taxi proves something important about transportation: people will find ways to move. In the absence of government-provided transit, markets emerge. In the absence of formal regulation, informal governance develops. In the absence of purpose-built vehicles, entrepreneurs adapt what's available—the ubiquitous Toyota HiAce appearing on four continents because it's durable, capacious, and cheap to maintain.</p>

<p>This isn't a story with a simple moral about government versus markets or formal versus informal economies. It's messier than that. Share taxis work, in the sense that they move hundreds of millions of people daily. They also sometimes fail catastrophically, as the South African taxi wars demonstrated. They fill gaps in public transit while making comprehensive transit planning harder. They're licensed but unregulated, essential but often unsafe, democratic in access but oligarchic in governance.</p>

<p>What they are, above all, is persistent. For as long as cities exist with more demand for mobility than their formal systems can supply, someone will be waiting in a minibus at a terminus, a conductor hanging from the door, calling out destinations, waiting for the last seat to fill.</p>
