        I've written a complete essay about ligatures, transforming the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a hook about the ampersand hiding in plain sight
- Explains the "crashing f" problem that makes ligatures necessary
- Traces the history from medieval monks through Gutenberg to digital typography
- Covers the German Eszett's journey from ligature to official letter
- Explains why Turkish can't use the fi ligature (different i's)
- Discusses letters that evolved from ligatures (W, Æ)
- Describes the modern renaissance of ligatures through OpenType
- Closes by circling back to the ampersand

The piece is approximately 2,800 words (about 14 minutes of reading), with varied sentence and paragraph lengths suitable for Speechify.
