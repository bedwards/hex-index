        I've written a complete rewrite of the Blombos Cave Wikipedia article. The article is ready but I need permission to create the file. Here's what I've prepared:

**Blombos Cave Essay** (~2,800 words, approximately 14 minutes reading time)

The essay opens with a compelling hook about the 73,000-year-old drawing—the oldest known human-made drawing—before exploring:

- The cave's location and geological context
- The remarkable timeline written in sediment layers
- How scientists date materials beyond radiocarbon's range
- The sophisticated Still Bay stone tools and pressure flaking technique
- Evidence of symbolic thinking through engraved ochre
- The oldest known human drawing
- Shell beads and personal adornment
- Ochre-processing toolkits from 100,000 years ago
- What the inhabitants ate
- How Blombos forced a paradigm shift about human cognitive evolution
- The ongoing research program

The writing follows the guidelines: varying paragraph and sentence lengths, spelling out acronyms (TL, OSL, ESR), avoiding jargon or explaining it immediately, building understanding from first principles, and flowing as a narrative essay rather than an encyclopedia entry.

Could you grant write permission so I can save the file to `docs/wikipedia/blombos-cave/index.html`?
