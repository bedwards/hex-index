        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on New Atheism. The article transforms the encyclopedic source into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Here's what I've done:

**Key improvements:**
- Opens with a narrative hook (the 2007 Four Horsemen meeting) rather than a dry definition
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for better audio rhythm
- Explained concepts from first principles (non-overlapping magisteria, the three-O God)
- Added historical context connecting New Atheism to the longer tradition of skepticism
- Provided nuanced coverage of both the movement's claims and its critics
- Used transitions and narrative flow rather than encyclopedic listing
- Spelled out all relevant concepts (omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence)

The article covers: the movement's origins after 9/11, what distinguished it from earlier atheism, detailed profiles of the Four Horsemen, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's role and later conversion, the broader movement, demographic patterns, major criticisms (including from fellow atheists), the debate over religion's harm, questions of morality without God, and the movement's legacy.

However, I need permission to write the file to the `docs/wikipedia/new-atheism/` directory. The directory may need to be created first, and then the file written.
