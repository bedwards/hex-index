        The HTML file for the metatheory Wikipedia rewrite is ready. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

- Opens with the dramatic hook of Gödel shattering Hilbert's dream
- Uses the pet shop joke from the related Substack article as a thematic touchpoint
- Explains the replication crisis and metascience in accessible terms
- Spells out acronyms like CONSORT and EQUATOR Network
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for natural audio reading
- Covers metamathematics, metalogic, metaphilosophy, and computational metatheory
- Connects metadata to real-world surveillance concerns
- Ends with practical wisdom about when to step back and examine our frameworks

The content runs approximately 2,500 words, providing around 15-20 minutes of reading material. I'm awaiting permission to write the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/metatheory/index.html`.
