        The rewritten article is ready. Here's the HTML content for the SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) Wikipedia article, transformed into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading:

```html
<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_of_Enemy_Air_Defenses">Wikipedia: Suppression of enemy air defenses</a></p>

<p>In the summer of 1972, American B-52 bombers flew into North Vietnamese airspace with a confidence that bordered on arrogance. Strategic Air Command had grown accustomed to these massive aircraft operating with near impunity. Then the SA-2 missiles started finding their marks. In the opening days of Operation Linebacker II, the losses were staggering enough to force a complete rethinking of how modern air forces deal with the deadliest threat they face: the enemy's ability to shoot them down from the ground.</p>

<p>This is the story of SEAD—Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses—a mission so critical to modern warfare that it can consume nearly a third of all aircraft sorties in the opening week of a conflict. It's the deadly chess match between pilots who want to drop bombs and the people on the ground who very much want to stop them.</p>

<h2>The Problem No One Wanted to Name</h2>

The article is approximately 5,000 words (about 20-25 minutes of reading), covering:

1. **Hook** - Opens with the dramatic Linebacker II losses, not a dry definition
2. **WWII origins** - Chain Home, German failures, Allied countermeasures
3. **Korean War** - The emergence of integrated air defense networks
4. **Vietnam** - Birth of Wild Weasels, anti-radiation missiles, the IADS problem
5. **Post-Vietnam developments** - The F-4G "triad," Soviet approaches
6. **Falklands and Bekaa Valley** - British improvisation vs. Israeli perfection
7. **Desert Storm** - The American template
8. **Kosovo** - F-117 shootdown and limits of stealth
9. **Iraq 2003** - MANPADS and distributed threats
10. **Ukraine 2022** - Modern failures and lessons
11. **Future** - Drones and evolving doctrine

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for audio listening, spells out acronyms on first use, and explains technical concepts from first principles.
