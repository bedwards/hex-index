<p>When the Bolsheviks seized power in October 1917, they faced an immediate problem: they needed cops. But they couldn't just keep the Tsar's police force—that would be ideologically unthinkable. How do you create a police force for a workers' revolution when police are, almost by definition, instruments of state oppression?</p>

<p>Their solution was linguistic as much as institutional. They called their new force the <em>militsiya</em>—literally "militia"—to suggest something fundamentally different from conventional police. Not a professional force serving the ruling class, but the armed self-organization of the people themselves. The "Workers' and Peasants' Militsiya," they named it, explicitly contrasting their creation with what they dismissed as the "bourgeois class protecting" police of capitalist nations.</p>

<p>It was, of course, still a police force. But the naming choice would echo through decades of Soviet history and across half of Europe.</p>

<h2>A Revolution in Naming</h2>

<p>The word itself predates the Bolsheviks. Russia's short-lived Provisional Government—the one that ruled for about eight months between the Tsar's abdication and Lenin's coup—had already decreed the creation of a "militsiya" in April 1917. Both governments shared the same instinct: distance yourself from the old regime by rejecting its vocabulary.</p>

<p>This wasn't mere propaganda. Words matter in revolutionary politics. The Tsarist police, the <em>okhrana</em>, had been genuinely despised—a sprawling apparatus of surveillance, informants, and political repression. Nobody wanted to inherit that legacy, even if they intended to build something equally powerful.</p>

<p>As the Soviet Union consolidated and then expanded its influence after World War II, the militsiya model spread across Eastern Europe. Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Baltic states all adopted some version of the system. The word became synonymous with communist-bloc policing—which is precisely why, after 1989, so many countries rushed to abandon it.</p>

<h2>The Great Renaming</h2>

<p>Between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the present day, an extraordinary wave of rebranding swept across the former communist world. One by one, countries switched from "militsiya" to "police"—the very word the Soviets had rejected as bourgeois.</p>

<p>The list is remarkable: Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Estonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Latvia, Mongolia, North Macedonia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, Russia, and Ukraine. Russia made the switch in 2011, Ukraine in 2015.</p>

<p>The symbolism was obvious. Calling your force "police" instead of "militsiya" announced: we are rejoining the West, or at least leaving the Soviet orbit behind.</p>

<p>Not everyone followed suit. Belarus, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan retain the militsiya name, as do the breakaway territories of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria—regions that, not coincidentally, remain closely aligned with Russia or stuck in frozen conflicts from the Soviet collapse. Uzbekistan took an unusual approach in 2019, removing "militsiya" from its laws without bothering to replace it with anything else.</p>

<p>In Kyrgyzstan, the debate continues. There's something almost poignant about it—as if the name itself has become a referendum on national identity and geopolitical orientation.</p>

<h2>How the Militsiya Actually Worked</h2>

<p>Names aside, the militsiya operated quite differently from Western police forces. Understanding these differences helps explain why post-Soviet policing has proven so difficult to reform.</p>

<p>First, the organizational structure. In most Western democracies, the Interior Ministry or Home Office is a political body—headed by a civilian politician, accountable to parliament, responsible for a broad portfolio that happens to include overseeing police. The Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, or MVD (from the Russian <em>Ministerstvo Vnutrennikh Del</em>), was something else entirely: a uniformed service led by militsiya generals, predominantly staffed by service personnel, and reporting directly to the president rather than the prime minister or legislature.</p>

<p>This matters enormously for accountability. Local militsiya departments answered to regional departments, which answered to the national MVD, which answered to the president. There was no meaningful local civilian oversight. Your city's militsiya chief wasn't accountable to your mayor.</p>

<p>The ranks reinforced this quasi-military character. Militsiya officers held ranks paralleling the army—private, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, major, colonel—with "of militsiya" appended to distinguish them. A detective might be a "major of militsiya," the head of an oblast's force typically a general. Only the very highest army ranks, like Marshal, had no militsiya equivalent.</p>

<h2>The Uchastkovyi: Your Neighborhood's Personal Policeman</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most distinctive feature of the militsiya was the system of <em>uchastkovyi militsioner</em>—roughly translatable as "neighborhood officer" or "quarter policeman." Every urban neighborhood and rural settlement was divided into <em>uchastoks</em>, each assigned to a specific officer whose job was to know everything about everyone in his territory.</p>

<p>The uchastkovyi was expected to personally know every ex-convict, every substance abuser, every young troublemaker in his area. He would visit them regularly for what was euphemistically called "preemptive influence"—showing up at your door to remind you that the state was watching. He handled minor disputes: family violence, noise complaints, parking problems.</p>

<p>In remote areas without permanent police stations, the uchastkovyi was the entire law enforcement presence. He maintained a small office, held regular hours for citizens to bring complaints, and served as the state's representative in daily life.</p>

<p>Americans might see a resemblance to the county sheriff system. But the comparison is misleading. Sheriffs are elected, and in their jurisdictions they are the chief law enforcement authority. An uchastkovyi was neither elected nor in charge—he was the lowest rung of a vast centralized hierarchy, a node in an information-gathering network that stretched all the way to Moscow.</p>

<p>The system's roots go back further than the Soviets. Imperial Russia had <em>uriadniks</em> performing similar functions in rural areas. What the Soviets added was the totalitarian dimension: uchastkovyi were responsible for enforcing the <em>propiska</em> system (internal passports that restricted where citizens could live and work) and monitoring former political prisoners, who had to register daily at their local MVD office.</p>

<h2>Who Drove the Cars</h2>

<p>Here's an oddity that catches many Westerners by surprise: most militsiya officers weren't allowed to drive police vehicles.</p>

<p>Neither uniformed officers nor detectives could simply get behind the wheel. Instead, specialist drivers—either military servicemen or civilian employees—were assigned to each car. The driver was also responsible for maintenance. Patrol regulations specifically required that these designated officer-drivers hold proper licenses and never abandon their vehicles.</p>

<p>This applied only to fully marked police cars with emergency lights and the distinctive blue license plates. Detectives could drive unmarked civilian cars registered to the MVD, which bore white plates with specific letter sequences (like o...vo, o...rr, or o...mm in Russian registrations). But here's the catch: these unmarked vehicles had no legal privileges on the road. No emergency lights, no sirens permitted. Technically, detective driving on assignment couldn't legally speed or run red lights.</p>

<p>The one exception was the traffic police—the GIBDD (<em>Gosudarstvennaya inspektsiya bezopasnosti dorozhnogo dvizheniya</em>, or State Traffic Safety Inspectorate). These officers received special training in high-risk driving and were permitted to drive their own vehicles, sometimes even their personal cars.</p>

<h2>Working Alone</h2>

<p>American cop shows have instilled a particular image: partners. Two officers in a car, bickering, bonding, backing each other up. The buddy-cop genre is practically its own film category.</p>

<p>The militsiya didn't work that way. Officers weren't assigned permanent partners. They worked alone or in larger groups as operations required, but that intimate two-person partnership was absent. This may seem like a minor procedural detail, but it shapes everything from officer safety to institutional culture to the kinds of corruption that can flourish. A lone officer is harder to supervise and has no built-in witness to his actions.</p>

<h2>Conscripts and Gendarmes</h2>

<p>For large events and regular urban patrolling, the militsiya had an unusual resource: conscripted soldiers from the Internal Troops and special motorized militsiya units (known by the Russian acronym SMChM).</p>

<p>These were essentially a gendarmerie—military forces performing police functions. They could patrol the streets alongside professional militsioners, or form cordons at soccer matches, concerts, and protests. The key difference from the professional militsiya: these soldiers carried no firearms during police duties. They were equipped with rubber batons (the PR-73) and tonfas (the PR-90). For riot control, they'd add ballistic shields and tear gas.</p>

<p>You could tell them apart by their uniforms. SMChM soldiers wore grey militsiya uniforms but with standard-issue <em>sapogi</em>—tall military boots—instead of the individual footwear that commissioned officers wore. Internal Troops wore green military uniforms entirely.</p>

<p>When not on policing duty, these soldiers lived in barracks and continued standard military training. Most SMChM units in cities were battalion-sized, with three notable exceptions. Kyiv and Leningrad each had regiments. Moscow had an entire division, the ODON, whose soldiers could be identified by shoulder patches featuring a white panther. Other Internal Troops units in the Moscow region wore white falcon patches.</p>

<p>This system—using military conscripts for routine policing—is alien to most Western democracies, where the separation of military and police functions is considered fundamental. But for the Soviet state, the line between internal and external security was always blurry, and manpower was cheap.</p>

<h2>Women in the Militsiya</h2>

<p>Women made up a significant portion of militsiya staff, but they were largely barred from positions involving physical risk. No female patrol officers, guards, or SWAT team members. They could carry firearms for self-defense, but not in roles that might actually require using them.</p>

<p>Instead, women worked as investigators, juvenile crime inspectors, and clerks. The exceptions were recent and tentative: some regions began experimenting with female traffic officers and detectives, but these remained unusual.</p>

<p>This pattern—women present in substantial numbers but segregated into "safe" roles—reflected broader Soviet and post-Soviet gender norms. The USSR famously celebrated its women cosmonauts and factory workers, but actual gender integration in dangerous professions remained limited.</p>

<h2>The Slang</h2>

<p>Every society develops slang for its police, and the terms often reveal underlying attitudes. In Russian, the formal term for a police officer is <em>militsioner</em>. The common slang is <em>ment</em>, roughly equivalent to "cop" in English—not particularly respectful, but not venomous either. The word probably derives from Polish, possibly from the Lwów dialect or from the Polish <em>menda</em>.</p>

<p>Then there's <em>musor</em>, plural <em>musora</em>. This one is offensive—it literally means "garbage" or "trash." But its origins are more interesting than a simple insult. It began as an acronym: MUS, for <em>Moskovskiy ugolovnyy sysk</em>, the Moscow Criminal Investigations Department in Imperial Russia. What started as bureaucratic shorthand curdled into contempt.</p>

<p>The evolution of that word—from neutral acronym to epithet—might tell you something about how Russians came to view their police over the decades.</p>

<h2>A Peculiar History of Ranks</h2>

<p>The militsiya's rank structure went through bewildering convolutions, reflecting the Soviet state's tortured relationship with tradition, hierarchy, and its own revolutionary origins.</p>

<p>Until late 1936, the militsiya used no personal ranks at all—much like the Red Army of the early revolutionary period. "Ranks" were positional: you were called by your job title, not by a personal designation that traveled with you. This was ideologically pure—ranks smacked of Tsarist class distinctions—but administratively chaotic.</p>

<p>When personal ranks returned in 1935, the militsiya created something strange: a hybrid system mixing standard military ranks (sergeant, lieutenant, captain, major) with old positional titles (squad leader, inspector, director), sometimes modified with grades like "senior" or "junior." The collar insignia were entirely original, unrelated to army designs.</p>

<p>The secret police (GUGB) adopted a similar structure in 1935, though with different insignia and commissar-style ranks for top officials. Then came new insignia in 1937 for the secret police and 1939 for the militsiya, now based on Red Army collar patches—but without actually aligning the rank structure. This created the absurd situation where a militsiya captain wore the three-rectangle insignia of an army colonel, and a militsiya major wore the insignia of a brigade commander, a rank the army abolished in 1940.</p>

<p>You can imagine the resentment this generated between army and NKVD officers.</p>

<p>Some rationalization came in 1943, when imperial-style shoulder boards replaced collar patches and ranks aligned more closely with the army. But the top militsiya ranks kept the commissar nomenclature—Commissar of Militsiya 3rd, 2nd, and 1st rank—even while wearing army-style general's shoulder boards. The secret police dropped commissar ranks in 1945. The militsiya held on until 1973.</p>

<p>By the 1970s, various "General of Internal Service" ranks (1st, 2nd, and 3rd rank) finally became the more comprehensible Major General, Lieutenant General, and Colonel General. The system had taken over fifty years to fully converge with military norms.</p>

<h2>More Than Just Police</h2>

<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs was never purely a police ministry. At various times, the MVD also encompassed the Internal Troops (a militarized gendarmerie), the prison system (including the notorious Gulag labor camp administration and its successors), and the passport and registration service.</p>

<p>The passport service deserves special mention because it was often integrated into local militsiya departments and considered one of their core functions. The <em>propiska</em> system it administered wasn't just about identification—it was a mechanism of social control, determining where Soviet citizens could legally live and work. Your relationship with the local militsiya wasn't optional; they controlled fundamental aspects of your life.</p>

<p>These various functions operated somewhat independently, with their own rank structures. A "Major of Internal Service" was distinct from a "Major of Militsiya"—same position in the hierarchy, different branch of the apparatus.</p>

<h2>The Vehicles</h2>

<p>Soviet militsiya cars have become objects of nostalgia and museum restoration. The classic fleet included the GAZ-21 Volga, the UAZ-452 van (an angular, almost comically utilitarian vehicle), the VAZ-2101 Zhiguli (the Soviet version of the Fiat 124), the VAZ-2106, and the GAZ-24 Volga.</p>

<p>These weren't high-performance pursuit vehicles by Western standards, but they were what the Soviet automotive industry could provide. Many survive today as restored showpieces in places like Minsk, where enthusiasts maintain them as rolling history lessons.</p>

<h2>What Remained</h2>

<p>Understanding the militsiya matters for understanding contemporary post-Soviet policing. When Russia reformed its police in 2011, changing the name from militsiya to <em>politsiya</em> ("police"), the underlying structures largely remained. Renaming something doesn't reorganize it.</p>

<p>The vertical hierarchy, the weak local accountability, the quasi-military culture, the fusion of policing with internal security functions—these persisted through the rebranding. Officers who had been militsioners woke up as policemen without their institutions fundamentally changing.</p>

<p>In Belarus, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan, where the militsiya name persists, so do the systems. Kyrgyzstan's ongoing debate about renaming is really a debate about reforming—and the resistance to changing the name reflects resistance to changing the institution.</p>

<p>The original Bolshevik logic—that naming your police "militia" made them fundamentally different from bourgeois police—proved hollow. A police force by any other name still arrests people, still maintains order, still serves the state that employs it. What mattered was never the name but the structures of power and accountability.</p>

<p>The word "militsiya" carried revolutionary pretensions for decades. Now it carries historical baggage. Either way, the word itself was always less important than the truncheon behind it.</p>
