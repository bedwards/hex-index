<h2>The MP Who Died Opening the Park He Championed</h2>

<p>On the second of June, 1892, Thomas Lynn Bristowe climbed the steps of Brockwell Hall to formally open London's newest public park. He was the local Member of Parliament, and this moment represented the culmination of years of work to transform a wealthy merchant's private estate into a green space for the people of south London. As he reached the top of the steps, ready to address the gathered crowd, his heart gave out. He died there, on the threshold of the very park he had helped bring into existence.</p>

<p>A bust of Bristowe was eventually returned to the park and unveiled in 2012, on its 120th birthday. But that dramatic death set a peculiar tone for Brockwell Park—a place that has never quite settled into being an ordinary urban green space.</p>

<h2>From Country Estate to Public Commons</h2>

<p>The land we now call Brockwell Park was once the country seat of John Blades, a glass merchant who built Brockwell Hall between 1811 and 1813. At that time, this part of south London was still in Surrey, a pastoral landscape of farms and estates rather than the dense urban sprawl it would become. The hall itself is a handsome Georgian building, now Grade II* listed—the asterisk indicating it's considered particularly important, in the top five percent of historic buildings in England.</p>

<p>The London County Council acquired the land and house in March 1891 for £117,000. That's roughly twelve million pounds in today's money, though such conversions are always imprecise. What matters is that Victorian Londoners, through their local government, decided this patch of countryside was too valuable to remain private.</p>

<p>They were thinking about density. London was growing explosively, and working-class districts like Brixton desperately needed open space. The original purchase covered about 78 acres. A decade later, in 1901, the Council added another 43 acres to the north, bringing the park to roughly its current size of about 126 acres—or just over 50 hectares, if you prefer metric.</p>

<h2>The View and the Wildlife</h2>

<p>Stand at the top of the hill in Brockwell Park and you can see the London skyline spread before you. The Shard, the Gherkin, the Walkie-Talkie—all those peculiarly nicknamed towers of the City and Canary Wharf punctuate the northern horizon. Nearly four million visits happen here each year, which makes it one of the most heavily used parks in south London.</p>

<p>Despite all those feet trampling through, the park remains ecologically important. It's designated as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation at Borough Grade I level—the highest local designation available. Ancient oaks stand throughout the grounds, some of them dating back to before the park existed, remnants of the hedgerows and woodlands of the original agricultural landscape.</p>

<p>The park hosts at least five species of bat. Pipistrelles are common—they're the ones you're most likely to see at dusk, fluttering erratically as they hunt insects. But rarer species visit too: Daubenton's bats, which skim low over water to catch prey; Noctules, among Britain's largest bats; Leisler's bats, similar to Noctules but slightly smaller; and Serotine bats, which prefer to hunt along woodland edges and around streetlights. If you're walking through Brockwell Park at twilight, you're walking through a bat hunting ground.</p>

<h2>Gardens Within the Park</h2>

<p>The walled garden is one of Brockwell Park's treasures, designed by J.J. Sexby, who was Superintendent of Parks for the London County Council from 1889 to 1935. Sexby essentially created the template for how London's public parks should look and function. His influence extended far beyond Brockwell—he shaped green spaces across the capital, and his book <em>The Municipal Parks and Gardens of London</em> became a standard reference.</p>

<p>The walled garden follows a classic English model. High walls create a sheltered microclimate, warmer in winter and protected from wind. Flowers and herbs fill the beds. Just outside the walled garden sit model village houses—tiny structures that were donated to the London County Council by a man named Edgar Wilson in 1943, during the darkest years of the Second World War. There's something touching about that gift, made while bombs were falling on London: a reminder of village life, of smaller scales, of peace.</p>

<p>The park also contains a water garden and a distinctive Victorian clock tower. These features give Brockwell a character distinct from London's royal parks. It's less manicured than Hyde Park or Regent's Park, more the product of Victorian civic pride than royal patronage.</p>

<h2>The Lido: Art Deco Swimming</h2>

<p>Near the northern edge of the park sits Brockwell Lido, an open-air swimming pool that has become something of a south London institution. The word "lido" comes from the Italian island of Lido di Venezia, near Venice, and entered British English in the 1930s when outdoor swimming pools became fashionable. Britain's climate makes outdoor swimming a rather optimistic pursuit, yet lidos developed devoted followings.</p>

<p>Brockwell Lido was built in that 1930s heyday and is now Grade II listed for its Art Deco architecture. The style emerged between the World Wars, characterized by bold geometric forms, rich colors, and confident modernity. An Art Deco building looks like it believes in progress.</p>

<p>The lido fell into disrepair in the late twentieth century, as many British lidos did. Maintaining an outdoor pool in a country where you might only use it comfortably for three months a year seemed increasingly uneconomic. But Brockwell's survived, was refurbished, and now includes the pool itself plus other health and fitness facilities. The attached café has become a destination in its own right.</p>

<h2>War Pigs and Cricket Crowds</h2>

<p>Parks reveal how cities change. In the 1920s, Brockwell Park contained thirteen cricket pitches. Matches drew crowds of up to 1,500 spectators. Cricket was then a mass spectator sport in a way that's hard to imagine today, when most matches are watched on television rather than from benches beside the boundary.</p>

<p>During the First World War, a large flock of sheep grazed in the park. This wasn't pastoral nostalgia—it was practical. With so many farm workers at the front, and with shipping lanes threatened by German submarines, Britain needed to produce more food domestically. Urban parks were pressed into agricultural service.</p>

<p>The Second World War brought a more unusual form of food production: pig clubs. Three sites in the park were dedicated to raising pigs, with sties built from timber and bricks salvaged from bombed houses. Local residents collected food scraps—pig swill—from their homes to feed the animals. It was communal, improvised, and born of necessity. The elegant parkland that John Blades had created as a gentleman's retreat became, briefly, a neighborhood pig farm.</p>

<h2>The Rock Against Racism Carnival</h2>

<p>The late 1970s were a tense period in British politics. The National Front, an explicitly fascist party, was winning local council seats and organizing openly in working-class neighborhoods. In response, a movement called Rock Against Racism emerged in 1976, using music to mobilize opposition to racism and fascism.</p>

<p>In September 1978, Rock Against Racism held a carnival in Brockwell Park. An estimated 150,000 people attended—an astonishing number for a free event in a local park. Elvis Costello and The Attractions headlined. People climbed trees and stood on the roofs of nearby flats to see. They lined the walls of the lido. Costello ended his set with "(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding," a song written by Nick Lowe that Costello had recently covered. The lyric's naive sincerity cut through the cynicism of punk, asking questions that felt urgent in a political moment defined by racial violence.</p>

<p>A year later, in September 1979, another Rock Against Racism event brought Aswad and Stiff Little Fingers to the park. Aswad were a British reggae band from west London; Stiff Little Fingers were a punk band from Belfast. The combination was deliberate—Rock Against Racism worked to build bridges between punk and reggae audiences, between white and Black working-class youth.</p>

<h2>Mud, Mayhem, and Mark E. Smith</h2>

<p>Brockwell Park's concert history is a catalog of near-disasters enthusiastically embraced.</p>

<p>In May 1981, Pete Townshend of The Who—"swigging Remy Martin brandy," according to contemporary accounts—headlined a benefit gig for the People's March for Jobs, a protest against mass unemployment. Seventy thousand people showed up.</p>

<p>In 1982, a Cannabis Law Reform Rally featured what one attendee described as "a wicked turbo sound rig with Jah Shaka, Coxone, King Sounds and DBC Rebel Radio's boxes all connected in a huge horseshoe." Sound system culture, which originated in Jamaica, had taken deep root in south London. The horseshoe formation meant you were surrounded by bass.</p>

<p>A 1983 Festival for Peace, organized by the Greater London Council and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, was compered by the legendary DJ John Peel. Madness headlined. Thirty thousand attended. But the day is remembered for something else: a young band called The Style Council, featuring Paul Weller after the breakup of The Jam, made only their second-ever public appearance. They were pelted with mud. So was Hazel O'Connor. The crowd had come to see The Damned, who had been scheduled early, and many arrived to find they'd missed them. Chants of "We want The Damned" rang out while unfortunate support acts dodged projectiles.</p>

<p>The Damned got their revenge, or at least their moment, a year later. In August 1984, the park hosted another GLC free festival. Ken Livingstone, then Leader of the Greater London Council, gave a speech. The Fall performed and were pelted with cans. The band's famously irascible frontman Mark E. Smith dodged one particularly well-aimed can, which sailed "about an inch from his face, when he suddenly twitched to the right and let it sail past him." It's the kind of reflex you apparently develop when you've been pelted by enough British festival crowds. The poet Benjamin Zephaniah was brought on to calm the increasingly rowdy audience before The Damned finally took the stage as headliners.</p>

<h2>From Cannabis to Corporate</h2>

<p>Between 2000 and 2004, Brockwell Park hosted an annual cannabis festival. This was during a period when Lambeth, the borough containing most of the park, was experimenting with effective decriminalization of cannabis possession. The Metropolitan Police, under an initiative called the Lambeth Cannabis Warning Scheme, cautioned people for possession rather than arresting them.</p>

<p>The experiment ended, and so did the festival. Lambeth Council stopped the cannabis festival in 2005, citing drug dealing at previous events. The park's days as a countercultural gathering place seemed to be waning.</p>

<p>The transition to paid events began gradually. Found Festival in 2016. Sunfall Festival in 2017. Then, in 2018, two established London festivals—Field Day and Mighty Hoopla—relocated to Brockwell Park. A twelve-foot-high steel fence went up to accommodate the ticketed events. What had been a free public space became, for certain weekends, a venue with admission charges.</p>

<p>More festivals followed: Cross The Tracks in 2019, Wide Awake in 2021, City Splash in 2022, Project 6 in 2023. These became the Brockwell Live series, running from late May to early June. The park had become a commercial enterprise.</p>

<h2>The Battle for Brockwell Park</h2>

<p>Not everyone was happy.</p>

<p>The festivals bring crowds and revenue, but they also bring damage. Heavy foot traffic compacts soil and destroys grass. Large vehicles tear up paths. Sound stages and vendor stalls leave marks. For a park that nearly four million people visit each year, weeks of intensive festival use exact a significant toll.</p>

<p>In 2024, poor weather combined with the festival season to create what critics called deteriorating conditions. A free family event called Brockwell Bounce was cancelled. Groups including Friends of Brockwell Park voiced growing opposition to the heavy commercial use of what was, after all, a public green space.</p>

<p>In 2025, a group called Protect Brockwell Park launched legal action. On the 16th of May, they won their challenge against Lambeth Council at the High Court. The judgment concerned, according to the Council and Brockwell Live, "a particular point of law and whether an administrative process had been carried out correctly." The festivals, they announced, would proceed anyway.</p>

<p>Protect Brockwell Park disagreed. They argued the High Court ruling meant the festivals lacked proper authorization. Lambeth Council, on the eve of the festivals commencing, approved new planning that allowed them to go ahead.</p>

<p>The conflict captures a tension inherent in urban parks. They are public commons, belonging to everyone, which means competing interests constantly struggle to define their use. Should parks be quiet refuges? Entertainment venues? Ecological preserves? Community gardens? Cricket grounds? All of these, somehow, at once?</p>

<h2>The Park in Song and Story</h2>

<p>Brockwell Park has seeped into popular culture in ways that reflect its particular south London character.</p>

<p>The San Francisco band Red House Painters, purveyors of a slow, melancholic style sometimes called "slowcore," wrote a song simply titled "Brockwell Park" for their 1995 album <em>Ocean Beach</em>. The album also contains an unlisted hidden track, "Brockwell Park (Part 2)." There's something fitting about a band from one foggy, hilly city singing about a park in another.</p>

<p>In 2015, during a BBC television special, the singer Adele explained that her song "Million Years Ago" was connected to Brockwell Park. "I drove past Brockwell Park," she said, "which is a park in south London I used to live by. It's where I spent a lot of my youth. It has quite monumental moments of my life that I've spent there, and I drove past it and I just literally burst into tears." The song is about the estrangement that comes with success—the sense that you can no longer return to the places and people that shaped you, even when they're just a car ride away.</p>

<p>Basement Jaxx, the electronic duo who are among the most famous musicians ever to come from Brixton, filmed the music video for "Do Your Thing" in Brockwell Park. The park was also used as a filming base camp for the 2015 movie <em>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</em>, directed by Guy Ritchie. And in Mo Hayder's crime novel <em>The Treatment</em>, Brockwell Park is a key location—appropriately, perhaps, given the novel's dark exploration of violence in south London.</p>

<h2>What the Park Contains</h2>

<p>Beyond the history and the controversies, Brockwell Park is simply a place where people go to do things.</p>

<p>There's a children's paddling pool, open in summer. A dog-free play area for children—a rarity, and useful for parents of small children who are frightened of dogs. A miniature railway runs on a seven-and-a-quarter-inch gauge, about eighteen centimeters, wide enough for children and adults to ride on scaled-down trains. A One O'Clock Club provides supervised play and activities for under-fives and their carers.</p>

<p>The café inside Brockwell Hall, at the top of the hill, commands the same views that John Blades must have enjoyed two centuries ago. Community greenhouses allow local residents to grow plants. Three duck ponds dot the landscape.</p>

<p>For sports, there's an all-weather pitch, a bowling green, a purpose-built BMX track, tennis courts, a basketball and volleyball court, grass and gravel football pitches, and cricket nets. Every Saturday morning, a free five-kilometer Parkrun attracts runners of all abilities. On Sundays, five-a-side football takes over.</p>

<p>And still, beneath all this activity, the ancient oaks stand, and the bats hunt at dusk, and the park endures.</p>

<h2>From Sheep to Sound Systems</h2>

<p>As far back as 1913, someone observed that "on the whole probably the people in Brockwell Park, like those in Hyde Park and the other parks, would refuse the weaker Italian stuff and demand the Wagner over and over again." The comment—about musical taste, and specifically about the public's appetite for bombastic German opera over lighter Italian fare—seems quaint now. But it captures something true about British parks: they have always been arenas for cultural argument.</p>

<p>What music should play? Who should attend? Who decides? These questions echo from 1913 to the Rock Against Racism carnivals to the festival fence wars of today.</p>

<p>The park opens at 7:30 in the morning and closes fifteen minutes before sunset, a schedule that shifts with the seasons. In midsummer, that's nearly ten in the evening. In midwinter, barely past four in the afternoon. The park's hours follow the sun, as they have since Victorian crowds first walked through the gates.</p>

<p>Thomas Lynn Bristowe died before he could finish his speech. The park outlived him by more than a century and will outlive the current controversies too. Whether it remains a commons in the true sense—open, free, and genuinely public—or becomes primarily a venue for ticketed events, is a question that south Londoners are still, loudly, debating.</p>
