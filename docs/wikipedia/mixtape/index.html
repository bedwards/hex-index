        I've written an 18-minute read essay on mixtapes that transforms the Wikipedia article into an engaging narrative optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about 50 Cent's 2002 story rather than a dry definition
- Traces the mixtape's journey from 1970s Bronx DJ recordings through the digital revolution to streaming platforms
- Explains key concepts like chopped and screwed, sample clearance, and the blurred distinction between mixtapes and albums
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for natural audio rhythm
- Adds cultural context about the romantic mixtape tradition and DJ Screw's influence
- Connects to the broader theme of artists bypassing gatekeepers

The article is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/mixtape/index.html` once write permissions are granted for that path. The directory will also need to be created first.
