        I've written the Windows Phone article but it needs permission to create the file. The article is complete and ready - it transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading, with:

- A compelling hook about the 2011 London announcement and its failed prediction
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for good audio rhythm
- Spelled-out acronyms (OLED, LTE, CEO, etc.)
- Technical concepts explained from first principles
- Interesting connections and narrative flow
- Approximately 25 minutes of reading material
- Proper HTML semantic markup matching the existing template structure

The file needs to be created at `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/windows-phone/index.html`. Would you like to grant permission to write this file?
