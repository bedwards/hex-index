<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area">Wikipedia: African Continental Free Trade Area</a></p>

<p>In March 2018, something remarkable happened in Kigali, Rwanda. Forty-four African nations sat down and signed the most ambitious trade agreement the continent had ever seen. The African Continental Free Trade Area, known as AfCFTA, would create a single market spanning 1.3 billion people across the world's second-largest continent. By number of participating countries, it became the largest free trade zone on Earth, second only to the World Trade Organization itself.</p>

<p>But here's the thing about Africa: it's not one economy. It's fifty-five countries, eight existing trade blocs, countless languages, multiple currencies, and a colonial legacy that built roads to ports rather than to neighboring nations. The AfCFTA wasn't just an economic agreement. It was an attempt to rewire a continent.</p>

<h2>The Long Road to Kigali</h2>

<p>The dream of African economic unity predates the trade agreement by more than half a century. In 1963, newly independent African nations formed the Organization of African Unity, a body dedicated to cooperation between states that had, just years earlier, been European colonies. The OAU had ambitions, but Africa remained fragmented—not just politically, but economically tied to its former colonizers rather than to itself.</p>

<p>By 1980, African leaders recognized the problem. They adopted the Lagos Plan of Action, a blueprint arguing that Africa should minimize its reliance on the West by trading more with itself. This seems obvious in hindsight, but consider the geography: French colonial railways in West Africa ran from interior mines straight to coastal ports, designed to extract resources and ship them to France. They didn't connect to railways in neighboring British colonies, which had been designed with identical logic pointing toward London. The infrastructure of extraction doesn't become the infrastructure of integration overnight.</p>

<p>The Lagos Plan sparked a proliferation of regional trade organizations. The Southern African Development Coordination Conference. The Economic Community of West African States. The East African Community. Each tried to reduce barriers within its region, with varying success. Then came the Abuja Treaty in 1991, which created the African Economic Community and laid out an ambitious vision: free trade areas, customs unions, an African Central Bank, and eventually a common currency. It was a fifty-year plan. The treaty's architects knew they were planting trees whose shade they might never sit in.</p>

<p>When the African Union replaced the Organization of African Unity in 2002, it inherited this vision. Economic integration became an explicit goal. But the AU faced the same problem its predecessor had: Africa was already divided into eight separate trade blocs, each with different tariff schedules, different rules of origin, different regulatory frameworks. How do you merge eight different systems into one?</p>

<p>The answer took another decade to formulate. At the 2012 AU summit in Addis Ababa, leaders finally agreed to create a Continental Free Trade Area by 2017. Negotiations began in earnest in 2015. Ten rounds of talks followed. Technical working groups hammered out details. And in March 2018, the ministers of trade approved a draft.</p>

<h2>What the Agreement Actually Does</h2>

<p>Trade agreements are often discussed in abstractions—"reducing barriers" and "liberalizing markets"—but the AfCFTA's provisions are concrete and consequential. At its core, the agreement commits member states to eliminating tariffs on most goods. How quickly depends on circumstances: five years for more developed African economies, ten for less developed ones, and thirteen for products deemed particularly sensitive. The goal is to reduce tariffs on ninety percent of all goods, with each nation permitted to protect just three percent of its products entirely.</p>

<p>But tariffs are only part of the story. Trade in Africa has long been strangled by what economists call "non-tariff barriers." These are the bureaucratic nightmares: customs officials who demand bribes, paperwork that takes weeks to process, regulations that vary inexplicably from one border crossing to the next. A 2019 study found that shipping goods from Mombasa, Kenya, to Kigali, Rwanda—about 1,500 kilometers—cost more than shipping them from Shanghai to Mombasa, a journey of roughly 8,000 kilometers across an ocean. The problem wasn't tariffs. It was everything else.</p>

<p>The AfCFTA attempts to tackle these barriers head-on. It establishes rules of origin—the criteria determining when a product qualifies for duty-free treatment. It creates an online mechanism for reporting non-tariff barriers, bringing transparency to previously opaque processes. And perhaps most importantly, it sets up the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System, or PAPSS, which launched in January 2022.</p>

<p>PAPSS deserves special attention because it solves a problem that sounds technical but has massive practical implications. Before PAPSS, if a Nigerian company wanted to pay a Kenyan supplier, the transaction typically had to route through dollars or euros, clearing through banks in New York or London. This added time, cost, and currency risk. With PAPSS, the Nigerian company can pay in naira, and the Kenyan company receives shillings, with the system handling the conversion directly between African currencies. It sounds simple. It wasn't.</p>

<h2>The Skeptics Had a Point</h2>

<p>Not everyone rushed to sign. Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, initially refused to join. President Muhammadu Buhari worried that the agreement would hurt Nigerian entrepreneurs and local industries. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria and the Nigeria Labour Congress praised his caution. Their concern was dumping—the practice of flooding a market with cheap imports to destroy local competitors. Would Nigerian factories, struggling with unreliable electricity and high costs, survive an influx of goods from countries with better infrastructure?</p>

<p>South Africa, the continent's second-largest economy, also hesitated initially. Both countries eventually signed—Nigeria in July 2019, South Africa in 2018—but their reluctance highlighted genuine tensions within the agreement. The AfCFTA's proponents argued that a larger market would allow African manufacturers to achieve economies of scale, making them more competitive globally. Skeptics countered that without protection, infant industries would be crushed before they could grow.</p>

<p>This tension isn't unique to Africa. Every trade agreement in history has sparked similar debates. What made the AfCFTA different was the baseline: intra-African trade accounted for only about fifteen percent of the continent's total trade when the agreement was signed. By comparison, intra-European trade exceeds sixty percent, and intra-Asian trade hovers around fifty percent. Africa was trading with everyone except itself.</p>

<p>The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa estimated in 2018 that the AfCFTA would boost intra-African trade by fifty-two percent by 2022. The World Bank, in a 2020 report, projected even more dramatic effects: thirty million Africans lifted out of extreme poverty, income gains for nearly seventy million people, and $450 billion in additional income by 2035. These were models, not guarantees, but they suggested the stakes were high.</p>

<h2>Implementation: The Hard Part</h2>

<p>Signing an agreement is one thing. Implementing it is another entirely.</p>

<p>The AfCFTA came into force on May 30, 2019, thirty days after the twenty-second country deposited its ratification. It entered its "operational phase" following a summit on July 7, 2019, in Niamey, Niger. Trading officially commenced on January 1, 2021. But these milestones were largely symbolic. The real work—harmonizing regulations, building infrastructure, training customs officials, convincing businesses to change their practices—continues.</p>

<p>The agreement is structured in phases. Phase One covers trade in goods and services. Phase Two addresses intellectual property rights, investment, and competition policy. Phase Three tackles e-commerce. The phases were supposed to proceed on a timetable, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted everything. Negotiations that were meant to conclude in December 2020 were pushed to December 2021. Even after that deadline passed, work continued.</p>

<p>A permanent secretariat was established in Accra, Ghana, to coordinate implementation. The secretariat operates within the African Union system but has independent legal personality—it can sign contracts, hire staff, and act on its own authority. It works alongside a bewildering array of committees: one for trade in goods, one for trade in services, one for rules of origin, one for trade remedies, one for non-tariff barriers, one for technical barriers, one for sanitary and phytosanitary measures. Dispute resolution mechanisms are still being negotiated.</p>

<p>The complexity is unavoidable. Consider just one issue: rules of origin. When does a product count as "African" and therefore qualify for duty-free treatment? If a garment is sewn in Ethiopia using fabric from China, is it African? What if the fabric comes from South Africa but the thread is from India? These questions sound pedantic, but they determine which products actually benefit from the agreement. Get them wrong, and companies will exploit loopholes to route non-African goods through the continent tariff-free, undermining the whole project.</p>

<h2>The Caribbean Connection</h2>

<p>In an unexpected twist, the AfCFTA has attracted interest from outside Africa entirely. Several Caribbean nations have begun seeking closer ties with the continent, and the African Union has started discussing the Caribbean as a potential "Sixth Region" under its 2003 Constitutive Act.</p>

<p>This isn't as strange as it might sound. The African diaspora in the Caribbean dates to the slave trade, and cultural connections have persisted for centuries. More practically, small island nations see opportunity in a market of 1.3 billion people. Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, and The Bahamas have joined the African Export-Import Bank. The Caribbean Development Bank has signed a partnership agreement with the African Development Bank. In 2022, Jamaica's former president called for Caribbean states to seek partnership with the AfCFTA.</p>

<p>Direct flights between Africa and the Caribbean are being established—Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana, and Suriname are all at various stages of launching routes. In August 2023, the African Export-Import Bank opened its first Caribbean Community office in Barbados, on land donated by the Barbadian government. Perhaps most significantly, in 2023, the central banks of the CARICOM bloc voted to adopt the African PAPSS system for clearing inter-regional transactions. The Caribbean is betting that Africa's economic future is bright enough to hitch their wagon to.</p>

<h2>Eritrea Stands Alone</h2>

<p>As of 2024, fifty-four of the African Union's fifty-five member states have signed the AfCFTA. Forty-eight have ratified it. Only Eritrea remains outside.</p>

<p>Eritrea's absence stems from its fraught relationship with Ethiopia, its neighbor and former ruler. Eritrea fought a brutal war of independence from Ethiopia that ended in 1993, then fought another border war from 1998 to 2000 that killed tens of thousands. A formal state of war persisted until 2018, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace agreement. Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize for it.</p>

<p>The peace agreement removed the formal barrier to Eritrean participation in the AfCFTA, and AU officials have expressed confidence that Eritrea will eventually join. But as of now, the country remains outside—a reminder that political tensions can trump economic logic, and that continental integration requires more than commercial agreements.</p>

<h2>What Success Would Look Like</h2>

<p>The AfCFTA's ambitions extend beyond reducing tariffs. Its architects envision a continent where capital and labor can move freely, where regional infrastructure connects rather than divides, where a customs union eliminates borders entirely for commercial purposes, and where African businesses can compete globally because they have a continental market to practice in first.</p>

<p>Whether this vision materializes depends on countless decisions yet to be made. Will governments actually enforce the agreement, or will it become another paper commitment honored in the breach? Will infrastructure investments follow, connecting markets that are currently isolated? Will African manufacturers become more competitive, or will they be displaced by imports from more efficient producers elsewhere on the continent?</p>

<p>The honest answer is that no one knows. Trade agreements are experiments. The European Union's single market took decades to build and still isn't complete. NAFTA, which became the USMCA, remains controversial more than thirty years after it was signed. The AfCFTA is attempting something even more ambitious—integrating fifty-five nations across a continent larger than the United States, China, India, and Western Europe combined.</p>

<p>But the attempt itself matters. For decades, African nations have traded more with their former colonizers than with each other. The AfCFTA represents a bet that this can change—that Africa can become an integrated economic zone rather than a collection of fragmented markets oriented toward the outside world. The infrastructure of extraction was built over centuries. Replacing it with an infrastructure of integration will take time, money, and sustained political will.</p>

<p>The agreement is in force. Trading has begun. The secretariat is operational. The payment system works. Forty-eight countries have ratified. The Caribbean is interested. What happens next is up to 1.3 billion Africans.</p>
