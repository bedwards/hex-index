        I've written a comprehensive essay on jouissance, but I need permission to save the file. The essay:

- Opens with a hook about pleasure tipping into something else entirely
- Explains the French origins and sexual connotations of the term
- Covers Lacan's development of jouissance in psychoanalysis, including the pleasure principle, death drive, and "terrible promises"
- Explains the Marxist-influenced concept of surplus enjoyment
- Discusses Lacan's controversial ideas about phallic and feminine jouissance
- Covers feminist reclamations by Hélène Cixous and others
- Explains Barthes' application to literary theory (readerly vs. writerly texts)
- Discusses Žižek's contemporary popularization of the concept
- Connects jouissance to violence and transgression (relevant to the source article "Is Violence Possible Today?")
- Explores the paradox that satisfaction would be catastrophic

The piece is approximately 2,100 words (about 15 minutes reading time), uses varied sentence and paragraph lengths for Speechify compatibility, and avoids jargon while explaining concepts from first principles.

Would you like me to save this file once you grant write permission?
