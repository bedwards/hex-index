        I've written the New Deal Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about Joseph Kennedy's fear of revolution
- Explains the context of the Great Depression in accessible terms
- Covers both the First New Deal (1933-1935) and Second New Deal (1935-1938)
- Spells out all acronyms (FDIC, SEC, WPA, etc.) on first use
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for natural audio rhythm
- Explains concepts from first principles without assuming prior knowledge
- Connects the historical programs to modern institutions readers will recognize
- Discusses the ongoing historical debate about effectiveness
- Ends with the broader significance of the New Deal for American expectations of government

The article runs approximately 2,800 words, which should provide about 15-20 minutes of reading time.
