        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on home video. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify reading. Here are the key features:

**Hook**: Opens with the compelling idea that for most of the 20th century, owning movies was "beyond the grasp of reasonable expectations"

**Structure**: The essay flows chronologically through:
- Edison and Pathé's failed 1912 attempts
- The hobbyist era of 8mm and 16mm film
- Ampex's studio-only videotape system
- The VHS/Betamax consumer revolution
- Magnetic Video's historic Fox deal
- The rental store era
- The sell-through revolution and Disney's children's market dominance
- Special interest videos (the "long tail" before the internet)
- DVD's advantages over VHS
- The Blu-ray vs HD DVD format war
- Streaming's disruption of physical media

**Writing style**: 
- Varied paragraph and sentence lengths for audio rhythm
- Numbers spelled out for Speechify
- Jargon explained (VCR, DVD acronyms expanded)
- Engaging narrative with quotes and concrete details
- Clean HTML with semantic markup

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/home-video/index.html` once you grant permission.
