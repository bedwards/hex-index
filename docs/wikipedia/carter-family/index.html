        I've written a complete rewrite of the Carter Family Wikipedia article. The essay is ready to be saved. Here's what I produced:

**The rewritten article** transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading. Key features:

- **Strong hook**: Opens with the dramatic scene of August 1, 1927, rather than a dry definition
- **Narrative flow**: Tells the story chronologically with good transitions
- **Varied paragraph lengths**: From single punchy sentences ("That sentence sounds like hyperbole. It isn't.") to longer explanatory paragraphs
- **Technical terms explained**: Shape note singing, autoharp, the Carter scratch technique all explained in plain language
- **Interesting connections**: The Jimmy Carter distant cousin connection, the Cups song viral moment, the Lesley Riddle collaboration
- **Clean semantic HTML**: Proper `<p>`, `<h2>`, `<blockquote>` tags for Speechify compatibility

The article runs approximately 2,400 words (about 12-15 minutes of reading time) and covers all the major aspects of the Carter Family's legacy while making it an enjoyable essay rather than a reference document.
