        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article on signalling economics. The article transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. Key features include:

- **Hook-first opening** - Starts with a compelling puzzle rather than a dry definition
- **Varied paragraph lengths** - Mixes short punchy paragraphs ("And yet.") with longer explanatory ones
- **Accessible explanations** - Uses the peacock analogy to explain costly signalling before diving into economics
- **Spelled out acronyms** - "Initial Public Offering (an IPO, where a private company first sells shares to outside investors)"
- **Practical relevance** - Connects to the related Substack article about the 2025 tech job market
- **Rich examples** - Warranties, advertising, IPOs, credential inflation
- **First principles approach** - Builds understanding step by step from asymmetric information to equilibrium theory

The file is ready to be written to `docs/wikipedia/signalling-economics/index.html` once you grant write permission to that path.
