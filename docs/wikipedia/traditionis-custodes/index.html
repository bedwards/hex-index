        The article has been written. Here's a summary of the rewrite:

**Traditionis custodes Essay** (~3,500 words, ~18 minutes reading time)

The essay transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into a narrative that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - The dramatic implication that Pope Francis was telling traditional Catholics they could barely have their beloved Mass
2. **Explains the historical context** - Vatican II's liturgical reforms, the Tridentine Mass vs. Novus Ordo, why this matters
3. **Traces the conflict** - From Lefebvre's rebellion through John Paul II's gradual openings to Benedict XVI's Summorum Pontificum
4. **Unpacks Francis's restrictions** - Each of the eight articles explained in plain language
5. **Explores the deeper tensions** - What Francis saw as division vs. what traditionalists see as beauty and reverence
6. **Connects to the Substack article** - The final section explicitly ties the traditional Catholic revival (including confession) in France to these liturgical debates

The essay avoids jargon (explaining terms like "motu proprio" and "lex orandi" in context), varies sentence and paragraph length for Speechify optimization, and presents both sides of the debate fairly while making the theological stakes clear.
