        I've written a complete rewrite of the Wikipedia article on Nudge Theory as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with the famous Schiphol Airport urinal fly story as a hook rather than a dry definition
- Explains the origins of the concept and its popularization by Thaler and Sunstein
- Breaks down the psychological foundations (Kahneman's System 1/System 2 thinking)
- Covers the main nudge techniques: defaults, social proof, and salience
- Traces the spread of nudge units through governments worldwide
- Discusses applications in healthcare, corporate settings, and fundraising
- Addresses the emerging concern of algorithmic nudging by AI systems
- Examines the mixed evidence on effectiveness
- Explores the ethical tensions around autonomy and manipulation
- Concludes with reflections on what this means for society

The writing varies sentence and paragraph length for audio listening, spells out concepts clearly, avoids jargon, and flows as a narrative essay rather than an encyclopedia entry. It's approximately 2,900 words (about 15 minutes of reading).

I need permission to write the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/nudge-theory/index.html`. Would you like to grant that permission?
