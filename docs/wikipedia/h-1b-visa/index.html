        I've written a comprehensive essay on H-1B visas that transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading. The essay:

- Opens with a compelling hook about the annual visa lottery
- Explains the visa system from first principles without assuming prior knowledge
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for natural audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms on first use (USCIS, etc.)
- Covers all major aspects: eligibility, the lottery system, employer sponsorship, living conditions, family provisions, taxes, the path to permanent residency, economics, fraud enforcement, and the recent $100,000 fee change
- Includes interesting details like Melania Trump's H-1B history
- Runs approximately 1,800 words (~9 minutes of reading)

The file is ready to be written to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/h-1b-visa/index.html` once you grant write permission.
