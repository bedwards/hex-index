        I've written the predictive coding article as a complete HTML document. Here's the content ready to be saved:

The article transforms the Wikipedia content into an engaging 22-minute essay that:

1. **Opens with a hook** - "You are not seeing the world right now. You're watching a movie your brain made up..."

2. **Covers the key concepts**:
   - The brain as a prediction machine
   - Helmholtz's unconscious inference (1860)
   - Top-down vs bottom-up processing
   - Rao and Ballard's computational model (late 1990s)
   - Precision weighting and Kalman filtering
   - Attention as precision modulation
   - Active inference and motor control
   - Neural architecture (cortical layers and columns)
   - Emberson's infant studies
   - Dual process theory connections
   - Interoceptive inference and emotions
   - The free energy principle

3. **Follows the guidelines**:
   - Spells out acronyms (ARAS, fNIRS, fMRI)
   - Explains technical terms in plain language
   - Varies paragraph and sentence length
   - Uses semantic HTML markup
   - Includes the source note and related article link

The file needs to be created at `docs/wikipedia/predictive-coding/index.html`. Would you like me to proceed with creating this file once permissions are granted, or would you like me to output the raw HTML for you to save manually?
