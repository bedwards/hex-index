        I've written the rewritten Gosplan article. Here's the complete HTML content:

<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan">Wikipedia: Gosplan</a></p>

<p>Imagine trying to coordinate every factory, farm, and mine in the largest country on Earth using nothing but pencils, paper, and a lot of very tired bureaucrats. No computers. No spreadsheets. Just an army of planners attempting to predict how much steel the tractor factory would need, whether the textile mills had enough wool, and if the coal mines could keep the whole system running. This was the audacious, impossible task that fell to Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central planning agency, for seventy years.</p>

<p>The results shaped one of history's great experiments in organizing human economic activity from the top down. And the failures offer lessons that resonate today, as we contemplate a world where artificial intelligence might finally have the processing power that Soviet planners could only dream of.</p>

<h2>Born from Chaos</h2>

<p>Gosplan didn't emerge from careful institutional design. It was born from desperation.</p>

<p>By 1919, Soviet Russia was in ruins. The October Revolution of 1917 had overthrown the Tsar, but then came civil war. The Red Army fought against the White movement, a loose coalition of anti-Bolshevik forces backed by Britain, France, Japan, the United States, and other countries eager to see the communist experiment fail. Cities emptied as residents fled to the countryside, seeking food and land. Factories went dark. The ruble became worthless as hyperinflation destroyed the currency.</p>

<p>What emerged was a desperate improvisation called "military communism." The government's Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense lurched from crisis to crisis, trying to keep whatever industry still functioned running for the Red Army's benefit. In the countryside, soldiers and officials seized grain from peasants, often at gunpoint. This wasn't planning. It was survival.</p>

<p>Long-term economic planning? That was a utopian dream while the survival of the Bolshevik state remained in question.</p>

<p>But by 1920, the Civil War turned decisively in the Bolsheviks' favor. And with military victory came the first serious discussions about how to actually run a planned economy. In March 1920, the Council of Workers' and Peasants' Defense was renamed the Council of Labor and Defense, known by its Russian acronym STO, and given a broader mandate. For the first time, Soviet Russia had what historian E.H. Carr called "a general planning organ with clearly defined functions."</p>

<h2>An Agency Nobody Wanted</h2>

<p>Here's an irony worth savoring: Vladimir Lenin, the leader most associated with Soviet central planning, initially opposed creating Gosplan.</p>

<p>On February 22, 1921, the day the decree establishing Gosplan was signed, Lenin published an article in Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, mocking advocates of a "single economic plan" for their "idle talk" and "boring pedantry." Lenin believed the real priority was electrification. His pet project, GOELRO, was an ambitious plan to build power stations across the country. As far as Lenin was concerned, that was the only "serious work" being done on economic planning.</p>

<p>But other Soviet leaders overruled him. Gosplan came into being anyway, though as a compromise, the head of GOELRO, a man named Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, was appointed to lead both organizations.</p>

<p>The new agency started small. Tiny, really. At its launch in April 1921, Gosplan's entire staff numbered just thirty-four people. These weren't party ideologues but academic experts in various industries, selected for their specialized knowledge. Only seven were members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>And Gosplan had no real power. It couldn't issue orders. It could only advise. To get anything done, it had to work through other government bodies.</p>

<h2>The Struggle for Influence</h2>

<p>The Soviet government in the 1920s wasn't a monolithic bloc executing a unified plan. It was a complex bureaucracy where different agencies competed for influence and resources. Gosplan's chief rival was Narkomfin, the People's Commissariat of Finance.</p>

<p>The tension between these two agencies reflected a fundamental debate about economic strategy. Narkomfin advocated for what might be called a gradualist approach: stabilize the currency, balance imports and exports through grain sales abroad, and let a regulated market system help the economy recover. This aligned with the New Economic Policy, or NEP, which Lenin had introduced in 1921 as a tactical retreat from full socialism. Under the NEP, small businesses could operate, peasants could sell their surplus produce, and foreign investment was cautiously welcomed.</p>

<p>Gosplan pushed in the opposite direction. Its leaders wanted cheap food to keep urban workers fed, and they wanted aggressive investment in heavy industry. They saw the market mechanisms of the NEP as a temporary compromise, not a permanent solution.</p>

<p>Leon Trotsky, then one of the most powerful figures in the Soviet leadership, became one of Gosplan's political patrons, championing the agency's calls for rapid industrialization.</p>

<p>Throughout the mid-1920s, this bureaucratic warfare continued. Gosplan gained expanded authority in 1922, with new powers to compose both long-term and immediate production plans. By 1925, it began issuing annual "control numbers," targets and guidelines for the economy. But these remained largely theoretical exercises. Gosplan's desires and actual policy were, as one observer put it, "largely disjointed."</p>

<h2>The Five-Year Plan Changes Everything</h2>

<p>Then came 1928.</p>

<p>Joseph Stalin, who had outmaneuvered Trotsky and other rivals to become the dominant figure in Soviet politics, launched the First Five-Year Plan. The NEP was finished. The Soviet Union would now pursue forced industrialization at breakneck speed, regardless of the human cost.</p>

<p>This transformed Gosplan from an advisory body into the nerve center of a command economy. Plans were no longer suggestions. They were orders.</p>

<p>But how do you actually plan an entire economy from a single office in Moscow?</p>

<h2>The Material Balance Method</h2>

<p>Gosplan's answer was something called the "material balance" system. Understanding this method reveals both the ambition and the fundamental limits of Soviet central planning.</p>

<p>The basic idea sounds straightforward. For any planning period, whether a single year or a full five-year plan, Gosplan would draw up balance sheets measuring the economy in physical units. Not money. Tons of steel. Meters of cloth. Cubic meters of timber. Kilowatt-hours of electricity.</p>

<p>Step one: figure out how much of each material would be available. Take production, subtract exports, add imports, and adjust for changes in stockpiles. Now you know your supply.</p>

<p>Step two: figure out where that material needs to go. The steel going to the tractor factory comes from the same total as the steel going to the shipyard. If you want more tractors, you need more steel. If you want more steel, you need more iron ore and more coal for the furnaces and more workers at the foundries.</p>

<p>Step three: identify mismatches. When the demand for steel exceeded the supply, planners had to make choices. Cut allocations somewhere. Or find ways to increase production. Or adjust the targets for all the downstream industries that depended on that steel.</p>

<p>Here's the catch. Every adjustment rippled through the system. Change the steel allocation, and you change the tractor production targets. Change the tractor production, and you change the agricultural output projections. Change the agricultural output, and you change the food available for workers, which affects labor productivity everywhere. A single modification could trigger hundreds or thousands of recalculations.</p>

<p>Without computers, Gosplan could only handle this complexity by dealing in very broad strokes. The economy was simplified into manageable categories. Details were left to lower levels of the bureaucracy, where local planners faced the same impossible coordination problems at smaller scales.</p>

<h2>The Information Problem</h2>

<p>There's a deeper issue here, one that economists call the "economic calculation problem." In a market economy, prices serve as signals. When something becomes scarce, its price rises. That price increase tells producers to make more and tells consumers to use less. Millions of these signals, constantly adjusting, coordinate economic activity without anyone having to understand the whole system.</p>

<p>Gosplan tried to replace this decentralized signaling with centralized knowledge. But how could any organization, even one staffed with brilliant experts, know everything necessary to make good decisions? How could planners in Moscow understand that a factory in Vladivostok was using too much electricity, or that a collective farm in Ukraine needed different fertilizer, or that consumers in Leningrad wanted more woolen coats?</p>

<p>The Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek had argued in the 1920s and 1930s that this was impossible in principle. Without market prices reflecting actual conditions of supply and demand, central planners would be flying blind. The Soviet experiment became the test case.</p>

<h2>The Falsification Cascade</h2>

<p>What actually happened was predictable in retrospect, though devastating in practice.</p>

<p>Plans came down from Gosplan with targets that were often impossible to meet. They reflected ideological commitments rather than realistic assessments. Stalin's government believed that socialist willpower could overcome material constraints. When reality disagreed, reality was expected to bend.</p>

<p>It didn't bend. Instead, people lied.</p>

<p>Factory managers reported production numbers they hadn't achieved. Collective farm chairmen claimed harvests that never happened. Regional officials passed along the fake statistics because their own careers depended on meeting targets. The lies accumulated as they traveled up the hierarchy.</p>

<p>Gosplan received this falsified data and used it to create the next plan. But if the baseline numbers were fiction, the new targets were fantasy built on fantasy. The gap between the plans and reality widened.</p>

<p>A parallel economy emerged to fill the gaps. Managers traded favors and materials outside official channels. Workers took second jobs in the informal sector. Enterprises engaged in what might charitably be called creative problem-solving and less charitably called systematic illegality. Some estimates suggest this "second economy" eventually encompassed a significant fraction of all economic activity.</p>

<p>The Soviet economists Nikolai Shmelev and Vladimir Popov later wrote that from the beginning, "the administrative system was distinguished by economic romanticism, profound economic illiteracy, and incredible exaggeration of the real effect that the 'administrative factor' had on economic processes."</p>

<h2>The Distortion of Wages</h2>

<p>The planning system also created strange incentive structures that persisted for decades.</p>

<p>Italian economic historian Rita Di Leo identified what she called "a compression of differentials" in Soviet wages. Manual labor and skilled trades ended up paying better than many professional and mental occupations. Work that produced measurable physical output, what planners called "productive" work, was valued over services and trade, which were considered "unproductive."</p>

<p>This made a certain internal logic within the planning framework. If you're measuring the economy in tons of steel and meters of cloth, then the workers producing those tons and meters seem more important than teachers or doctors or shopkeepers. But the result, as Di Leo observed, "calls into question the modernization of society, its efficiency, its competitiveness."</p>

<p>A society that undervalues education and services in favor of raw material production isn't building the human capital it needs for long-term development. The Soviet Union industrialized rapidly under Stalin, at catastrophic human cost, but it never developed the flexible, innovative economy that could have sustained growth indefinitely.</p>

<h2>Reorganization After Reorganization</h2>

<p>Soviet leaders kept trying to fix the system by reorganizing it.</p>

<p>In 1930, the Statistical Directorate was merged into Gosplan. In 1931, Gosplan was resubordinated directly to Sovnarkom, the Council of People's Commissars. In 1955, the agency was split in two: one commission for long-term planning looking ten to fifteen years ahead, another for current planning based on the existing five-year plans.</p>

<p>The bureaucracy shuffled. The fundamental problems remained.</p>

<p>Gosplan coordinated with an alphabet soup of other agencies. The USSR Central Statistical Directorate. The People's Commissariat of Finance. The Supreme Soviet of the National Economy, known as VSNKh. The State Bank, Gosbank. The State Supply Committee, Gossnab. Each had its own turf to protect, its own information to hoard, its own bureaucratic logic to follow.</p>

<p>The agency was headquartered in Moscow in a building that, after the Soviet Union's collapse, became home to the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament. That physical continuity hints at an institutional truth: even when the ideology changes, the structures of state power have a way of persisting.</p>

<h2>Seventy Years of Trying</h2>

<p>Gosplan survived from its modest founding in 1921 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Seventy years of five-year plans. Seventy years of material balances. Seventy years of trying to make central planning work.</p>

<p>The achievements were real. The Soviet Union transformed from a largely agricultural society into an industrial power. It built massive infrastructure. It defeated Nazi Germany in the largest and bloodiest theater of World War Two. It launched the first satellite and the first human into space. For a time, it seemed like a genuine alternative to Western capitalism.</p>

<p>But the system carried the seeds of its own stagnation. Without market prices to signal real conditions, without the feedback loops that let decentralized decisions adjust to local knowledge, the Soviet economy became increasingly rigid and inefficient. By the 1980s, the gap between the Soviet standard of living and the West's had become undeniable. The system that was supposed to overtake capitalism had fallen far behind.</p>

<h2>Lessons for an AI Age</h2>

<p>Why does any of this matter now?</p>

<p>Because we're entering an era when artificial intelligence might actually have the computing power that Gosplan lacked. Modern machine learning systems can process vastly more information than any team of human planners. They can identify patterns across millions of data points. They can optimize supply chains and predict demand with unprecedented accuracy.</p>

<p>Some see this as an opportunity to revisit questions that seemed settled. If the problem with central planning was insufficient information processing capacity, what happens when that constraint disappears? Could AI succeed where Soviet bureaucrats failed?</p>

<p>The story of Gosplan suggests caution. The information problem wasn't just about computing power. It was about the nature of knowledge itself, how local, tacit, constantly changing information gets incorporated into economic decisions. It was about incentives, why the people generating data had reasons to lie. It was about power, how concentrated authority corrupts the feedback loops that any complex system needs.</p>

<p>Faster computers don't solve those deeper problems. They might even make them worse, by creating an illusion of omniscience that encourages overreach.</p>

<p>The Soviet planners weren't stupid. They were often brilliant, dedicated, and working within a system that had its own internal logic. Their failure wasn't primarily one of intelligence or effort. It was structural. The system they were asked to manage was beyond the capacity of any central authority to manage well.</p>

<p>That structural insight might be the most valuable thing Gosplan can teach us as we think about how much of economic life we want to entrust to algorithmic coordination. The question isn't just "can AI do this?" It's "should any single system, however intelligent, have that much control?"</p>

<p>Gosplan's building still stands in Moscow, housing a different kind of institution now. But the questions it embodied, about knowledge, coordination, and the limits of central control, remain as urgent as ever.</p>
