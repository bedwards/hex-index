        The essay has been written. It transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia article on dog whistle politics into an engaging, narrative-driven piece optimized for Speechify text-to-speech reading.

Key changes from the original:
- Opens with Lee Atwater's inflammatory 1981 quote as a hook instead of a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Explains concepts from first principles (what a dog whistle is, why it undermines democracy)
- Adds transitions and narrative flow between sections
- Spells out acronyms (CRT, DEI) when introduced
- Removes list formatting in favor of prose
- Adds contextual analysis and connections between examples
- Maintains substantive coverage (~3,000 words, approximately 15-20 minutes of reading)
