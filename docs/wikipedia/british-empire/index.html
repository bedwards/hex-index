        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article about the British Empire, but I need file write permissions to save it. The article is ready - it transforms the encyclopedic Wikipedia content into an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading.

The essay:
- Opens with the memorable "sun never sets" hook instead of a dry definition
- Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio rhythm
- Explains concepts from first principles (e.g., what privateers were, how the triangular trade worked)
- Follows a narrative arc from England's late start to the empire's collapse
- Connects to Ed West's article about being a "visitor from a dying empire"
- Runs approximately 25 minutes of reading time

Would you like to grant write permissions so I can save the file?
