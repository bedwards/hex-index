<p>In Venezuelan military uniforms, generals wear golden sun emblems on their shoulders—a symbol of rank and honor. But starting in the 1990s, those shining soles became associated with something far darker: cocaine trafficking on a massive scale. The "Cartel of the Suns" isn't a cartel in the traditional sense. There's no single kingpin, no formal hierarchy, no corporate structure like the infamous Medellín or Sinaloa organizations. Instead, it's a label—journalistic shorthand for a sprawling system of corruption that allegedly reaches from border checkpoint guards all the way to the presidential palace.</p>

<p>The story begins, improbably enough, with the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>

<h2>The CIA Connection That Started It All</h2>

<p>In 1993, two Venezuelan National Guard generals found themselves at the center of a bizarre scandal. Ramón Guillén Dávila and Orlando Hernández Villegas, both serving in the country's Anti-Drug National Command, were investigated for drug trafficking. The twist? Guillén had approved a cocaine shipment from Venezuela to the United States at the CIA's request. The American intelligence agency wanted to infiltrate Colombian drug gangs and needed Venezuelan cooperation to make the operation credible.</p>

<p>Thor Halvorssen, Venezuela's anti-drug commissioner at the time, defended Guillén's innocence. But the damage was done. Journalists seized on the story and coined the term "Cartel de los Soles"—named for those gleaming sun insignias that marked the generals as high-ranking officers. The name stuck.</p>

<p>What makes this origin story so revealing is how it foreshadowed everything that would come later: the blurred lines between law enforcement and criminality, the international dimensions of the drug trade, and the way legitimate operations could provide cover for illicit ones.</p>

<h2>The Rot Moves Up the Ranks</h2>

<p>By 1998, reports of military involvement in drug trafficking were becoming harder to ignore. At first, the corruption seemed almost quaint—officers accepting payments to look the other way while traffickers moved their product. But the geography of Venezuela made deeper involvement almost inevitable.</p>

<p>Venezuela shares a long, porous border with Colombia, which produces more cocaine than any other country on Earth. Colombian cartels needed transit routes, and Venezuela offered an attractive option: a Caribbean coastline for shipping, proximity to Central American corridors, and increasingly, officials willing to be bought.</p>

<p>Héctor Landaeta, a journalist who wrote extensively about these connections in his book "Chavismo, Narco-trafficking and the Military," described how the corruption spread like an infection. It started at the border, with low-level units accepting bribes. Then it moved upward. Junior officers who had been enriched by the trade rose through the ranks, bringing their criminal connections with them. Eventually, the rot reached the very top.</p>

<p>Some analysts believe this process actually began before Hugo Chávez came to power. Officers involved in the failed 1992 coup attempts—the ones that first brought Chávez to national prominence—allegedly formed a group called the "Cartel Bolivariano" or Bolivarian Cartel. The Los Angeles Times noted at the time that some officers may have sought to overthrow the government precisely because there was "money to be made from corruption, particularly in drugs."</p>

<h2>The Chávez Years: Expansion and Immunity</h2>

<p>When Hugo Chávez won the presidency in 1998, he inherited a military already compromised by drug money. What happened next remains hotly debated. Critics argue that Chávez deliberately expanded the system, using drug trafficking profits as a tool to buy loyalty. Defenders say he was fighting an uphill battle against entrenched corruption while also resisting American imperialism.</p>

<p>The facts suggest a complicated picture.</p>

<p>Chávez gave military officials control over billions of dollars in social programs—money that allegedly disappeared into private accounts. He also provided what amounted to legal immunity for officials involved in trafficking. The calculation, if it was one, seemed clear: loyalty to the revolution was worth more than clean hands.</p>

<p>In 2005, Chávez made a dramatic move that would reshape the drug trade in the region: he expelled the United States Drug Enforcement Administration from Venezuela, accusing its agents of espionage. The Venezuelan government claimed that drug seizures actually increased 80 percent that year without American involvement. But that spike proved temporary. In later years, seizures declined, and evidence mounted that trafficking was actually expanding.</p>

<p>Around this time, a reporter and city council member named Mauro Marcano began publicly accusing high-ranking officials of drug involvement. He alleged that Alexis Maneiro, who headed both the National Guard and the National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services, was deeply involved in trafficking.</p>

<p>Shortly after making these accusations, Marcano was murdered.</p>

<h2>How the System Actually Works</h2>

<p>To understand the Cartel of the Suns, you have to abandon the mental image of a traditional drug cartel. Think instead of a franchise operation—or perhaps more accurately, a protection racket that spans an entire military apparatus.</p>

<p>At the lowest level, National Guardsmen compete fiercely for postings at border checkpoints. These positions are valuable not for their salaries but for the bribes that come with them. A guard at a key crossing point can earn far more by looking the other way than he could through legitimate means. But much of that bribe money flows upward to commanding officers, who take their cut before passing the remainder further up the chain.</p>

<p>The corruption extends through all branches of Venezuela's armed forces: the Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Guard. According to investigative journalists at InSight Crime, who have studied the phenomenon extensively, the system operates as a "loose network of cells" rather than a unified organization. Different groups compete with each other, sometimes violently. There's no single chain of command for criminal operations, even as the legitimate military hierarchy continues to function.</p>

<p>Robert E. Looney, writing in the Routledge Handbook of Caribbean Economies, describes it as "a loose assembly of high-ranking retired military men" who focus specifically on transportation. They don't produce drugs or set prices. They don't fight for territory like street gangs. Instead, they provide a service: moving cocaine from Colombia through Venezuela to key hubs in Honduras, the Dominican Republic, Suriname, and onward to Europe via Africa.</p>

<p>This transportation focus is crucial. Venezuela doesn't produce cocaine—that's Colombia's role. It doesn't manufacture fentanyl—that's primarily Mexico and China. What Venezuela offers is geography and corrupted institutions: air bases that can shelter drug flights, ports that can load shipping containers without inspection, and officials at every level willing to facilitate the trade.</p>

<h2>The Incidents That Made Headlines</h2>

<p>Occasionally, the system's workings become visible through spectacular failures.</p>

<p>In September 2013, authorities at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris discovered 31 suitcases containing 1.3 tons of cocaine on an Air France flight from Venezuela. The seizure "astonished" French officials—it was the largest cocaine haul ever recorded on mainland France. The incident allegedly involved members of the Venezuelan National Guard.</p>

<p>Five months later, a commander of the Venezuelan National Guard was arrested while driving to Valencia with his family. In his vehicle: 554 kilograms of cocaine.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most politically explosive incident came in November 2015, when Drug Enforcement Administration agents in Haiti arrested two relatives of Cilia Flores, the First Lady of Venezuela. Her adopted son and nephew were attempting to move 800 kilograms of cocaine from Venezuela to the United States. A DEA source stated, unofficially, that the shipment had been allowed to pass through Venezuela due to government corruption. Some analysts suggested it may have been facilitated by corrupt members of the Presidential Honor Guard itself.</p>

<h2>The Question of Command</h2>

<p>Here's where the story becomes genuinely contentious.</p>

<p>In 2020, the United States Department of Justice indicted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on drug trafficking charges, offering a $15 million bounty for information leading to his arrest. That bounty has since increased dramatically—first to $25 million under the Biden administration after Maduro's inauguration for a third term in January 2025, then doubled to $50 million by the Trump administration in August 2025.</p>

<p>The American government's position is clear: Maduro personally leads the Cartel of the Suns and profits directly from the drug trade. In December 2025, the State Department went further, designating the Cartel of the Suns as a Foreign Terrorist Organization with Maduro named as its head.</p>

<p>But independent experts have pushed back hard against this characterization.</p>

<p>InSight Crime argued that the U.S. sanctions "incorrectly portray it as a hierarchical, ideologically driven drug trafficking organisation rather than a profit-based system of generalised corruption involving high-ranking military figures." Philip Johnson, another analyst, suggested that "the charge of central coordination by Maduro is indicative of U.S. efforts to delegitimize the Venezuelan government."</p>

<p>The distinction matters enormously. If the Cartel of the Suns is a formal organization led by Maduro, then targeting it through military action could be justified as counter-terrorism or counter-narcotics. If it's actually a decentralized system of corruption that Maduro tolerates or benefits from but doesn't command, then the same military action looks more like regime change dressed in counter-drug clothing.</p>

<p>In August 2025, the United States deployed 4,500 troops and several Navy warships to the southern Caribbean, officially for counter-narcotics operations targeting groups including the Cartel of the Suns. Critics saw the timing and scale as preparation for potential military intervention in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Adding another layer of complexity, in December 2025, former Venezuelan General Clíver Alcalá Cordones made a startling claim: the real heads of the Cartel of the Suns weren't Maduro at all, but rather Vice President Delcy Rodríguez and her brother Jorge Rodríguez. In this telling, Maduro himself is merely a figurehead.</p>

<h2>The Accusers and the Accused</h2>

<p>Several individuals have been specifically named as leaders or key figures in the Cartel of the Suns. Their stories reveal how the system operates and how the United States has tried to dismantle it.</p>

<p>Diosdado Cabello is perhaps the most prominent figure accused of leading the organization. In January 2015, his former security chief, Leamsy Salazar, fled to the United States with help from the DEA's Special Operations Division. Salazar made explosive claims: he had personally witnessed Cabello ordering the transport of tons of cocaine out of Venezuela, with shipments going through the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (known as the FARC) to the United States and Europe, possibly with Cuban assistance.</p>

<p>In May 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Cabello, his wife, his brother, and his frontman Rafael Sarria. The Treasury alleged that Cabello had used his government power to profit from "extortion, money laundering, and embezzlement," that he coordinated trafficking with Vice President Tareck El Aissami, and that he divided profits with President Maduro. Perhaps most damningly, the Treasury claimed Cabello would use public information to track wealthy traffickers, then steal their drugs and property to eliminate competition.</p>

<p>Hugo Carvajal, the former head of Venezuelan military intelligence, followed a different path. In 2014, he was detained in Aruba despite holding a diplomatic passport and being named consul general to the island. The arrest came at U.S. request, based on accusations of drug trafficking ties and connections to the FARC. He was released after authorities determined he had diplomatic immunity, but was declared persona non grata. Years later, in July 2023, Carvajal was arrested in Spain and extradited to the United States. In June 2025, he pleaded guilty to four charges, including narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine.</p>

<p>Tareck El Aissami, who served as Vice President of Venezuela, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in February 2017 under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. The accusation: facilitating drug shipments from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States. The sanctions froze tens of millions of dollars allegedly under his control.</p>

<p>Néstor Reverol, head of the Bolivarian National Guard, was indicted by the United States in August 2016. Prosecutors alleged he had tipped off traffickers, cancelled investigations, and released people involved in drug shipments.</p>

<p>The list goes on. General Henry Rangel Silva and two other officials were sanctioned in 2008 for materially helping the FARC in illegal drug trade. (Rangel Silva would later become governor of Trujillo state, winning election by over 82 percent of the vote.) Yazenky Lamas, a former pilot for First Lady Cilia Flores, was extradited from Colombia after allegedly providing air traffic codes that allowed cocaine-carrying planes to impersonate commercial flights—he was linked to hundreds of such drug flights.</p>

<h2>The Regional Dimension</h2>

<p>Venezuela's drug connections extend far beyond its borders, involving neighboring countries and international organizations in complicated ways.</p>

<p>The relationship with Colombia is central. Colombian cartels produce the cocaine; Venezuelan networks move it. The FARC, Colombia's leftist guerrilla group (now largely demobilized but with splinter factions still active), allegedly served as a crucial intermediary. British officials claimed that planes from Colombia involved in trafficking would be sheltered by Venezuelan Air Force bases.</p>

<p>In 2025, a coalition of countries took coordinated action. The United States, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, and Argentina all designated the Cartel of the Suns as a terrorist organization. This represented a significant escalation—terrorist designations carry legal consequences far beyond normal sanctions, potentially justifying military action and complicating any future diplomatic resolution.</p>

<p>It's worth putting the numbers in perspective. About 2,660 tons of cocaine are produced annually in Colombia. An estimated 400 tons transit through Venezuela each year, with most destined for Europe rather than the United States. America's main drug problem isn't Venezuelan-transited cocaine but Mexican fentanyl—a synthetic opioid that Venezuela neither produces nor ships.</p>

<p>So why the intense focus on Venezuela? According to former U.S. officials, the country is unique because of "the degree of state control and involvement in the drugs trade." In other words, while many countries have corrupt officials who profit from trafficking, Venezuela stands out for how thoroughly the corruption appears to have captured state institutions.</p>

<h2>What Makes This Different</h2>

<p>The Cartel of the Suns challenges our usual frameworks for understanding organized crime.</p>

<p>Traditional drug cartels are private enterprises that corrupt governments from the outside. They bribe, threaten, or kill officials to create space for their operations. The relationship is parasitic—the cartel feeds on the state but remains separate from it.</p>

<p>In Venezuela, the boundary between state and criminal enterprise appears to have dissolved. The same people who command military units, run intelligence agencies, and hold cabinet positions allegedly also coordinate drug shipments. They don't need to bribe officials because they are officials. The state hasn't been corrupted by organized crime; in this telling, organized crime has become a function of the state.</p>

<p>This creates genuine policy dilemmas. Sanctions that target drug traffickers also target government officials, making diplomatic engagement nearly impossible. Counter-narcotics operations shade into regime change. And the people who would need to reform the system are the same people profiting from it.</p>

<p>Mildred Camero, a former anti-drug official under Chávez, witnessed one aspect of this merger. In 2005, all branches of Venezuela's armed forces were assigned to combat drug trafficking, granting military units access to data previously held only by the National Guard. In theory, this was about coordination. In practice, it spread both the responsibility for fighting drugs and the opportunity to profit from them across the entire military apparatus.</p>

<h2>An Unfinished Story</h2>

<p>The Cartel of the Suns remains, in many ways, a mystery wrapped in propaganda wrapped in genuine criminal activity.</p>

<p>That corruption exists within Venezuela's military and government seems undeniable—the individual cases are too numerous and too well-documented to dismiss. That high-ranking officials have profited enormously from the drug trade also seems clear. But whether there's truly a coordinated organization with Maduro at its head, or instead a chaotic system of competing corrupt networks that he tolerates without controlling, remains genuinely uncertain.</p>

<p>The American government has chosen to treat it as the former, culminating in the 2025 Foreign Terrorist Organization designation. Critics see this as weaponizing counter-narcotics policy for geopolitical ends—using the drug war to justify what might otherwise look like interference in another country's government.</p>

<p>What's not in doubt is the human cost. The cocaine that moves through Venezuela ends up fueling addiction and violence throughout the Americas and Europe. The corruption that enables that trade has hollowed out Venezuelan institutions, contributing to the country's ongoing political and economic crisis. And the military buildup in the Caribbean raises the specter of conflict in a region that has known too much of it already.</p>

<p>The golden suns on Venezuelan generals' uniforms were meant to signify honor and achievement. Thirty years after journalists first coined the term, those symbols have become shorthand for something else entirely—a cautionary tale about what happens when the people sworn to protect a nation become its predators.</p>
