<p class="source-note">Based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settler_violence">Wikipedia: Israeli settler violence</a></p>

<p>In the rolling hills of the West Bank, a peculiar legal arrangement exists that would strike most observers as fundamentally unjust: two populations living side by side, governed by entirely different legal systems. Israeli settlers answer to Israeli civilian courts. Palestinians answer to military tribunals. The consequences of this arrangement have played out over decades in patterns of violence, impunity, and territorial expansion that have reshaped the landscape of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

<h2>The Geography of Impunity</h2>

<p>To understand settler violence, you first need to understand the unusual legal architecture that enables it.</p>

<p>In 1967, Israel passed emergency regulations granting extraterritorial rights to Israeli citizens living in the occupied territories. What this means in practice is that an Israeli settler who commits a crime in the West Bank is prosecuted under Israeli civilian law—the same system that would apply if they committed the crime in Tel Aviv. A Palestinian accused of the same act faces military law, with its different procedures, different standards of evidence, and generally harsher punishments.</p>

<p>The Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem has documented how this dual system creates what they call a "double standard"—Israelis receive more legal protections and face lighter punishments than Palestinians living in the same territory. The system violates two foundational principles of law: equality before the courts, and the idea that laws should apply uniformly within a given territory.</p>

<p>The practical effects are stark. United Nations figures from 2011 revealed that ninety percent of complaints filed by Palestinians against settlers with the Israeli police never led to any indictment. Nine out of ten. This isn't just a statistic—it represents thousands of incidents where victims reported crimes, entered the legal system, and emerged with nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>Palestinian police, meanwhile, are explicitly forbidden from responding to settler violence. This fact alone undermines their credibility among the people they're meant to serve. They watch crimes occur and can do nothing.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Organized Violence</h2>

<p>Physical violence by settlers against Palestinians began taking systematic form in 1980, when religious settlers formed a clandestine organization that would later be called simply "the Jewish Underground." Israeli law enforcement dismantled this network in 1984, but the phenomenon it represented proved far more durable than any single organization.</p>

<p>The Oslo Accords of 1993—the same agreement meant to pave the way toward peace—actually triggered a new wave of settler violence. The logic was straightforward if brutal: any move toward territorial compromise would be met with force on the ground, raising the cost of peace to the point where it became unthinkable.</p>

<p>This brings us to a tactic that has come to define settler extremism: the "price tag" attack.</p>

<p>The name captures the essential idea. When the Israeli government takes any action against settlements—evacuating an outpost, dismantling a structure, even negotiating with Palestinians—settlers make someone pay a price. Usually Palestinians, who are, as B'Tselem bluntly puts it, "easy victims." Occasionally Israeli security forces themselves become targets.</p>

<p>Michael Sfard, a lawyer with the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din, has explained the strategic calculus behind this approach. A few dozen to a few hundred extremist settlers have developed a playbook: when security forces arrive to dismantle an illegal outpost, some settlers confront them directly while others fan out to attack nearby Palestinian villages. The commanders must then choose between completing their mission and protecting civilians. They often abandon the operation entirely. The outpost gets rebuilt. The price tag strategy works.</p>

<h2>The Numbers Tell a Story</h2>

<p>In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the trend lines began pointing sharply upward.</p>

<p>A 2012 European Union report found that settler violence had more than tripled in just three years. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded approximately twenty-one hundred attacks over an eight-year period from 2006 to 2014—a rate that nearly quadrupled during that span.</p>

<p>Between January and November 2008, Israeli authorities opened 515 criminal cases against settlers for violence against Arabs or Israeli security forces. Of these, 502 involved what officials classified as "right-wing radicals," while thirteen involved "left-wing anarchists"—presumably pro-Palestinian activists. The senior Israeli commander in the West Bank identified a hard core of a few hundred activists responsible for most of the violence.</p>

<p>In 2021, another surge occurred after a sixteen-year-old settler died during a car chase with Israeli police. He had been throwing rocks at Palestinians. In the weeks that followed, settlers launched forty-four separate attacks, injuring two Palestinian children. The violence prompted condemnation at the United Nations Security Council.</p>

<p>Then came October 2023, and everything got worse.</p>

<h2>After October 7th</h2>

<p>The Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, transformed the context for settler violence. In the year that followed, Al Jazeera documented 1,423 recorded incidents of settler violence in the West Bank—more than one hundred per month. The heaviest concentrations hit Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate with 321 incidents, followed by Nablus Governorate with 319 and Hebron Governorate with 298.</p>

<p>The BBC, reporting in May 2024, noted that since the war began, settlers "have acted with near-impunity."</p>

<p>April 2024 brought a particularly revealing episode. When an Israeli teenager named Benjamin Achimeir disappeared on April 12—his body was found the next day—settlers rampaged through eleven Palestinian villages before any investigation could determine what had happened. Four Palestinians were shot dead. Thousands of animals were killed. A dozen homes and over a hundred cars were burned.</p>

<p>BBC News obtained messages from settlers' WhatsApp groups that suggested this wasn't spontaneous rage but rather, as they put it, "an organised campaign of revenge … carried out by co-ordinated groups on the ground, and targeted against ordinary Palestinians with no apparent connection to the murder of Benjamin Achimeir other than the bad luck of living nearby."</p>

<p>Think about that phrase: the bad luck of living nearby.</p>

<h2>The Government Connection</h2>

<p>For most of the history of settler violence, Israeli governments maintained at least some daylight between official policy and settler extremism. That began changing in late 2022, when Israel elected a government that brought far-right leaders of the settlement movement directly into cabinet positions.</p>

<p>The Huwara rampage of February 2023 followed. Named after the Palestinian town it devastated, it marked a new phase of open, large-scale settler violence.</p>

<p>In January 2025, when Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, the deal included prisoner releases on both sides. Defense Minister Israel Katz made a decision that illuminated official attitudes toward settler violence: he released all seven Jewish Israelis who had been detained for allegedly committing attacks on Palestinians. His stated rationale was blunt: "It is better for the families of Jewish settlers to be happy than the families of released terrorists."</p>

<p>Two days later, on January 19, Israelis burned homes and vehicles in the villages of Turmus Ayya, Sinjil, and Ein Siniya. An Israeli ultranationalist group called "Fighting for Life" had issued a call for an "offensive initiative" in the West Bank "to destroy their celebrations"—meaning Palestinian celebrations of the prisoner release—"with an attack." The group declared that Israelis "if needed will come to spoil the celebration of the enemy by themselves."</p>

<p>The Israeli military arrested two suspects.</p>

<p>On January 20, settlers attacked the villages of Jinsafut and al-Funduq. By January 22, no arrests had been made.</p>

<h2>Hebron: A Case Study</h2>

<p>To see how settler violence operates at close range, consider Hebron.</p>

<p>Somewhere between five hundred and six hundred Israeli settlers live in Hebron, surrounded by a Palestinian population of 167,000. It's one of the most intensely contested places on earth, and B'Tselem has documented what they call "grave violations" of Palestinian human rights stemming directly from the settler presence.</p>

<p>The pattern includes what the organization describes as "almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city." Movement restrictions in Hebron rank among the harshest anywhere in the occupied territories. Palestinians living in the city's H2 sector—the portion under direct Israeli military control—face violence not only from settlers but from Israeli border police and the Israel Defense Forces themselves.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch has documented how settlers routinely stone and shoot at Palestinian cars, often abusing Palestinians "in front of Israeli soldiers or police with little interference from the authorities."</p>

<p>B'Tselem's catalog of tactics goes further: blocking roadways to impede Palestinian life and commerce; shooting solar panels off rooftops; torching automobiles; shattering windows; destroying crops; uprooting trees; harassing merchants in marketplaces. The organization states plainly that "some of these actions are intended to force Palestinians to leave their homes and farmland, and thereby enable the settlers to gain control of them."</p>

<p>This is the mechanism by which territory changes hands—not through formal annexation or diplomatic negotiation, but through accumulated violence that makes life unbearable until people leave.</p>

<h2>The Question of Religious Justification</h2>

<p>Most settlers are not violent. In 2011, the BBC reported that "the vast majority of settlers are non-violent but some within the Israeli government acknowledge a growing problem with extremists." An Israeli defense minister, Moshe Ya'alon, stated that "most of those extreme right wing activists" don't actually live in settlements and don't represent the settler community.</p>

<p>Yet religious justifications for violence have emerged from certain rabbinical figures, and these require examination.</p>

<p>In 1983, when an eleven-year-old Palestinian girl from Nablus was killed by settlers, the chief rabbi of the Sephardic community reportedly cited a Talmudic text in the killers' defense. The text, according to reports, justified killing an enemy when one could perceive that a child would grow up to become your enemy.</p>

<p>Settler militants have sought rabbinical rulings to justify acts meant to block peace agreements or prevent the return of land to Palestinians. Some rabbis have blessed the theft of Palestinian olive harvests. Former chief rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu declared: "Since the land is the inheritance of the People of Israel, planting on this land by gentiles is planting on land that does not belong to them. If someone puts a tree on my land, both the tree and the fruit it yields belongs to me."</p>

<p>Some rabbinical extremists have invoked the biblical commandment to exterminate the Amalekites—an ancient enemy of the Israelites mentioned in the Hebrew Bible—to justify both expelling Palestinians and killing Arab civilians.</p>

<p>These voices, it must be emphasized, do not represent mainstream Jewish religious thought. Prominent figures have condemned settler violence in the strongest terms.</p>

<h2>Voices of Condemnation</h2>

<p>Rabbi Menachem Fruman of Tekoa, himself a settler, said: "Targeting Palestinians and their property is a shocking thing. It's an act of hurting humanity. This builds a wall of fire between Jews and Arabs."</p>

<p>Hanan Porat, a former member of the Knesset and longtime advocate for settlements, called price tag attacks "immoral" and "unheard of." He warned that such violence "gives legitimacy to those who are interested in undermining the outpost issue."</p>

<p>Dani Dayan, chairman of the Yesha Council—the umbrella organization representing all settlement municipalities—declared settler violence "morally bankrupt" and said it only served to "hinder the settlers' struggle."</p>

<p>The Israeli newspaper Haaretz, in an editorial following violence during a police evacuation, stated that "Israeli society has become accustomed to giving lawbreaking settlers special treatment." The paper characterized attacks on soldiers and policemen as "terrorism."</p>

<p>These condemnations raise an uncomfortable question: if settler violence is so widely deplored, even within the settlement movement, why does it continue? Why does it escalate?</p>

<h2>The International Legal Framework</h2>

<p>Israel has justified its civilian settlements by arguing that the territories in question are not occupied but "disputed," and that temporary use of land and buildings may be permissible under claims of military necessity.</p>

<p>International institutions have disagreed comprehensively.</p>

<p>The United Nations has affirmed that the continuation of colonialism in all its forms constitutes a crime under international law, and that colonized peoples have an inherent right to struggle for self-determination. National liberation struggles are categorized as international armed conflicts under the Geneva Conventions, to which most nations—including Western democracies—are parties.</p>

<p>The International Court of Justice has been even more direct. In its legal analysis, the court concluded that Israel breached its international obligations by establishing settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem. The court ruled that Israel cannot invoke self-defense or military necessity to justify what it characterized as an unlawful regime.</p>

<p>The court went further, finding that the Israeli system violates basic human rights of Palestinians by restricting their movement, their ability to work, their access to healthcare and education, and their ability to maintain an adequate standard of living. One notable asymmetry: these restrictions apply to all inhabitants of the territory except Israeli citizens.</p>

<h2>The Cycle Continues</h2>

<p>In March 2025, dozens of Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians in Jinba, near Masafer Yatta, injuring six people. Israeli security forces arrived, arrested twenty-two Palestinians, and detained no settlers.</p>

<p>In April 2025, approximately fifty Israelis attacked the village of Duma, setting fires and injuring three Palestinians. Security forces said they worked to "disperse the violent confrontation between Israeli civilians and Palestinians." No arrests were announced.</p>

<p>In June 2025, a settler killed a Palestinian named Audah Hadhaleen. In September 2025, another large-scale attack struck the neighboring village of Khallit al-Dabe'.</p>

<p>The pattern holds. Violence occurs. Some condemnations follow. Arrests of Palestinians outnumber arrests of settlers. The outposts expand. The cycle repeats.</p>

<h2>What This Reveals</h2>

<p>Settler violence is not merely a series of individual criminal acts. It is a phenomenon that operates within—and is shaped by—a legal system that treats different populations differently based on their nationality. It advances territorial aims that formal government policy cannot openly pursue. It is condemned by some within the settlement movement while being enabled by the structure within which settlements exist.</p>

<p>The journalist covering this story faces a challenge: how do you describe a system where officially illegal outposts get rebuilt after every evacuation, where ninety percent of complaints go nowhere, where the release of settlers detained for violence is celebrated as a diplomatic win?</p>

<p>Perhaps this: settler violence exists in a space where law and power have diverged, where what is legal and what is possible have become different categories entirely. Palestinians living in this space experience this divergence in their daily lives—in burned olive groves, shattered windows, and the knowledge that their police cannot protect them.</p>

<p>This is not ancient history or distant geopolitics. It is happening now, in villages whose names appear briefly in news reports before disappearing again into the steady accumulation of incidents that reshape, acre by acre, the map of the Middle East.</p>
