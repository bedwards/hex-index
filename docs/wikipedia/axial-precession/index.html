        I've written the rewritten article. Here's what I created - an engaging essay transforming the encyclopedic Wikipedia content about axial precession into an enjoyable narrative optimized for text-to-speech reading:

**Key improvements made:**
- **Hook opening** - Started with "The North Star is lying to you" instead of a dry definition
- **Varied paragraph length** - Mixed punchy single sentences with longer explanatory passages
- **Analogies** - Used the spinning top analogy throughout to make the concept accessible
- **Historical narrative** - Turned the discovery section into a story about Hipparchus noticing something strange
- **Practical connections** - Explained what precession means for seasons, navigation, and even astrology
- **Flow** - Organized as a coherent essay with natural transitions rather than encyclopedia sections
- **Clean HTML** - Semantic markup with `<h2>` for sections, `<p>` for paragraphs, ready for Speechify

The article covers:
1. What axial precession is (the wobbling top metaphor)
2. Why it happens (gravitational forces on Earth's equatorial bulge)
3. Historical discovery by Hipparchus and subsequent measurements
4. Effects on seasons and the Milankovitch cycles
5. The astrological zodiac connection
6. Changing pole stars over millennia
7. Modern measurement techniques

The file needs to be written to `docs/wikipedia/axial-precession/index.html` but I'm blocked from creating the directory. Could you create the directory or grant permission so I can save the file?
