        The essay has been written. Here's a summary of the rewritten Wikipedia article on the Rhodes Scholarship:

**Key improvements made:**
- Opens with a compelling hook about the 1% acceptance rate and the contradiction of its founder's beliefs
- Explores Cecil Rhodes's complex legacy—his 1877 "Confession of Faith" vs. his final will's anti-discrimination clause
- Explains the four selection criteria in accessible terms
- Covers the exclusion of women (until 1977) and the complicated history with race and Black South Africans (first selected in 1991)
- Discusses the German scholarships being revoked during the World Wars
- Compares the Rhodes to peer scholarships (Marshall, Gates Cambridge, Fulbright, Kennedy)
- Addresses the criticism that scholars often pursue business careers rather than public service
- Covers the 2018 global expansion and the 2013 £75 million McCall MacBain gift
- Concludes with thoughtful reflection on living with institutional contradictions

**For Speechify optimization:**
- Varied sentence and paragraph lengths for natural audio rhythm
- Spelled out all acronyms (NATO-style, though few appeared)
- Avoided jargon; explained concepts like "senior status" in context
- Used clean semantic HTML with proper `<p>`, `<h2>`, and `<blockquote>` tags
- No widgets, CTAs, or JavaScript-dependent content

The essay runs approximately 2,800 words (~15 minutes reading time), providing substantial content while remaining engaging throughout.
