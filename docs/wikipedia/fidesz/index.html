        I've written a comprehensive essay rewriting the Wikipedia article about Fidesz. The essay transforms the encyclopedic content into an engaging narrative that:

1. Opens with a compelling hook about the party's founding under semi-legal conditions
2. Traces the dramatic ideological transformation from liberal student movement to illiberal governing party
3. Explains complex concepts like "illiberal democracy" and the System of National Cooperation in accessible terms
4. Varies paragraph and sentence length for audio listening
5. Spells out acronyms on first use
6. Provides historical context and interesting connections

The article is approximately 2,800 words, which should provide around 15-20 minutes of reading time. I'm waiting for permission to write the file to `/Users/bedwards/hex-index/docs/wikipedia/fidesz/index.html`.
