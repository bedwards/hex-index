<p>When a ship owner in New York asked the young Robert Morrison if he really expected to make an impression on the vast Chinese Empire, Morrison replied with characteristic dry wit: "No sir, but I expect God will!"</p>

<p>It was 1807. Morrison was twenty-five years old, sailing toward a country that had executed people for teaching its language to foreigners. He would spend the next twenty-seven years there, and by the end, he would accomplish something that had eluded European missionaries for centuries: a complete translation of the Bible into Chinese.</p>

<h2>The Shoemaker's Son</h2>

<p>Robert Morrison was born on January 5, 1782, in Bullers Green, a tiny settlement near Morpeth in the coal-mining country of Northumberland, England. His father James was a Scottish farm laborer who had married an English woman named Hannah Nicholson. Robert was the youngest of their eight children.</p>

<p>When Robert was three, the family moved to Newcastle, where James found steadier work making shoes. The Morrisons were devout members of the Church of Scotland—what Americans would call Presbyterians—and they raised their children on a strict diet of Scripture and catechism.</p>

<p>The boy took to it with frightening intensity. At age twelve, Robert stood before his pastor and recited the entire 119th Psalm from memory. This is not a short passage. Psalm 119 is the longest chapter in the Bible, containing 176 verses organized into 22 sections, one for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The child did not miss a single word.</p>

<p>By fourteen, Robert had left school to apprentice in his father's shoe-making business. He worked twelve to fourteen hours a day at manual labor. Most young men in his position would have collapsed into bed each night with no energy for anything else. Morrison somehow found one or two hours daily for reading, meditation, and keeping a diary filled with intense self-examination.</p>

<p>But the teenage years also brought rebellion. For a couple of years, he fell in with rough companions and occasionally drank to excess. This period ended abruptly around 1798, when Morrison experienced what evangelicals call a conversion—a sudden, overwhelming awareness of sin and spiritual danger that drives someone to seek salvation.</p>

<blockquote>It was about five years ago that I was much awakened to a sense of sin… and I was brought to a serious concern about my soul. I felt the dread of eternal condemnation. The fear of death compassed me about and I was led nightly to cry to God that he would pardon my sin.</blockquote>

<p>He broke off from his drinking companions. He began visiting the sick with a charitable organization called the Friendless Poor and Sick Society. In his spare time, he taught poor children to read. At his workbench, he kept a Bible or commentary open before him while his hands stayed busy with leather and thread.</p>

<h2>The Call to China</h2>

<p>This was the era of the Evangelical Revival, when John Wesley was still alive and Protestant churches were establishing foreign mission societies for the first time. Morrison devoured two publications—The Evangelical Magazine and The Missionary Magazine—that chronicled this new movement to spread Christianity around the globe.</p>

<p>He wanted desperately to join it. But there was an obstacle: his mother. Morrison had promised her he would not leave England as long as she lived. He was present to care for her during her final illness, and she gave him her blessing to proceed only as she was dying in 1804.</p>

<p>Within days of her death, Morrison applied to the London Missionary Society. His letter was dated May 27, 1804. The board interviewed him the very next day and accepted him on the spot—no second interview required. They sent him to an academy in Gosport, near Portsmouth, for theological training.</p>

<p>For a while, Morrison wavered between two possible destinations: Timbuktu in Africa or China. His prayer was characteristically ambitious: he asked God to station him wherever "the difficulties were greatest, and, to all human appearances, the most insurmountable."</p>

<p>China won.</p>

<h2>Learning an Impossible Language</h2>

<p>The idea of translating the Bible into Chinese was not new. In 1798—the same year Morrison experienced his conversion—a clergyman named William Willis Moseley had discovered something remarkable in the British Museum: a manuscript containing most of the New Testament already translated into Chinese, probably by Jesuit missionaries decades earlier. Moseley printed a hundred copies of a tract arguing for the importance of publishing the Scriptures in Chinese and sent them to every Anglican bishop and mission agency in England.</p>

<p>Most replied with discouragement. The cost would be enormous. The "utter impossibility" of distributing books inside China made the project pointless.</p>

<p>But one copy reached Dr. David Bogue, the head of Hoxton Academy in London. Bogue replied that if he had been younger, he would have devoted the rest of his life to spreading the gospel in China. He promised to find suitable candidates for the mission.</p>

<p>He chose Morrison.</p>

<p>There was, however, a small problem. Morrison needed to learn Chinese, and in early nineteenth-century England, this was nearly impossible. Chinese was considered one of the most difficult languages in the world for English speakers. There were no textbooks, no language schools, no audio recordings. The Chinese writing system alone contained thousands of characters that had to be memorized individually.</p>

<p>Morrison found his teacher through sheer luck: a student from Canton named Yong Sam-tak who happened to be lodging in London. Their relationship got off to a rocky start. Morrison absent-mindedly burned a piece of paper with Chinese characters on it, which horrified his tutor—in Chinese culture, written characters have spiritual significance, and destroying them carelessly was deeply offensive. Yong Sam-tak stormed out and didn't return for three days.</p>

<p>Morrison learned his lesson. From then on, he wrote his practice characters on tin that could be erased and reused. The two men reconciled and worked together intensively, studying an early Chinese translation of the Gospels and a hand-copied Latin-Chinese dictionary. Eventually, Yong Sam-tak even joined Morrison for family worship.</p>

<p>By the time he was ready to sail, Morrison had also studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London and astronomy at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The London Missionary Society wanted him fully prepared. Their hope was that he would master everyday spoken Chinese, compile a dictionary, and perhaps—if God willed it—translate the entire Bible.</p>

<h2>The Long Way to China</h2>

<p>Getting to China was itself an adventure. Morrison was ordained in London on January 8, 1807, and desperately wanted to leave immediately. But the British East India Company—the corporation that controlled British trade with Asia—had a policy of refusing to carry missionaries on its ships. They feared that religious agitation might disrupt their lucrative commerce.</p>

<p>With no British ships available, Morrison had to sail first to America. He left England on January 31, 1807, and arrived in New York City about a month later.</p>

<p>The American detour turned out to be strategically valuable. Morrison needed protection from someone with official standing if he was going to survive in China, where foreigners were barely tolerated and missionaries were technically illegal. The United States consul in Canton agreed to help.</p>

<p>On May 12, 1807, Morrison boarded the American vessel Trident, bound for Macau. After 113 days at sea, he arrived on September 4.</p>

<h2>The Forbidden Country</h2>

<p>China in 1807 was ruled by the Qing dynasty, which had governed the country since 1644. The Qing emperors were deeply suspicious of foreign influence. Trade with Western nations was restricted to a single port—Canton (modern Guangzhou)—and even there, foreigners were confined to a small area outside the city walls called the Thirteen Factories.</p>

<p>The rules were strict. Foreign merchants could stay only during the trading season. They could not bring their wives or families. They could not learn Chinese. They could not travel into the interior. And they absolutely could not preach or distribute religious literature.</p>

<p>The penalty for a Chinese person teaching their language to a foreigner was death.</p>

<p>Morrison arrived with letters of introduction to prominent English and American merchants. They received him kindly but told him frankly that his mission was hopeless. Sir George Thomas Staunton, a leading figure in the British community who had actually learned some Chinese himself, laid out the obstacles: the death penalty for Chinese teachers, the expulsion of any foreigner not engaged in trade, and the bitter hostility of the Portuguese Catholic missionaries in Macau, who would surely stir up trouble against a Protestant competitor.</p>

<p>Within three days of arriving in Macau, Morrison was expelled by the Catholic authorities. He fled to the Thirteen Factories in Canton, where an American merchant offered him a room.</p>

<p>This began a strange double life. Morrison effectively passed himself off as American—the Chinese, he discovered, hated and feared the British more than other Westerners. He hired Chinese tutors secretly, knowing that both he and his teachers were risking their lives. He could not leave his Chinese books lying around, lest anyone suspect he was learning the language. He lived in near-complete seclusion, afraid to be seen in public.</p>

<h2>Hardship and Perseverance</h2>

<p>The early months were brutal. Morrison's servants cheated him. His Chinese tutor demanded extortionate fees. A man who agreed to buy Chinese books for him robbed him in the transaction. His funds dwindled alarmingly.</p>

<p>To save money, he tried living in a single room until doctors warned him that fever would be the inevitable result. His loneliness was crushing. The prospect, he wrote, seemed "cheerless in the extreme."</p>

<p>At first, Morrison tried to blend in by adopting Chinese customs. He ate local food, learned to use chopsticks, grew his fingernails long, and even cultivated a queue—the long braided ponytail that Qing-dynasty men were required to wear as a sign of submission to Manchu rule. A colleague noted that "he walked about the Hong with a Chinese frock on, and with thick Chinese shoes."</p>

<p>It didn't work. A foreigner in Chinese clothes only attracted more suspicion. People assumed he was trying to sneak into Chinese society to spread his "contraband religion." Morrison eventually gave up and returned to Western dress and manners.</p>

<p>Political troubles made everything worse. England was at war with Napoleon, and a British naval squadron descended on Macau to prevent the French from attacking English trade routes. The Chinese authorities in Canton were furious. Reprisals were threatened against English residents. Panic spread. English families fled to ships and made their way to Macau. Morrison went with them, clutching his precious manuscripts and books.</p>

<p>He fell seriously ill and retreated to Macau on June 1, 1808. Finding housing was a nightmare. Landlords refused to take him in, or charged ruinous prices for miserable rooms. One ceiling collapsed on him. Even then, he would have stayed—until his landlord raised the rent by a third, forcing him back into the streets.</p>

<p>Through it all, Morrison kept working. He labored on his Chinese dictionary. He prayed aloud in broken Chinese to improve his fluency. He had become such a recluse, so fearful of being noticed and expelled, that his health deteriorated further.</p>

<p>But there was one silver lining in all this suffering: by the time this terrible period ended, Robert Morrison had mastered both Mandarin and Cantonese.</p>

<h2>The Translator</h2>

<p>What Morrison accomplished over the next two decades is almost incomprehensible given the obstacles he faced.</p>

<p>He translated the entire Bible into Chinese. Not just the New Testament—the whole thing, Genesis to Revelation. This was not a revision of earlier Catholic manuscripts but a fresh translation from the original Hebrew and Greek. He worked with Chinese assistants, most notably a man named Liang Fa who would become one of the first ordained Chinese Protestant ministers.</p>

<p>The translation was published gradually. The Book of Acts appeared in 1810. The Gospel of Luke came out in 1811. The complete New Testament was finished in 1813. The entire Bible, Old and New Testaments together, was completed in 1823.</p>

<p>But Morrison didn't stop there. He compiled a massive Chinese-English dictionary—the first of its kind—that ran to six volumes and remained the standard reference work for decades. He wrote Chinese grammars and phrase books for future missionaries. He translated Chinese legal codes into English for the East India Company, which paid him well and gave him official cover to remain in China.</p>

<p>He also founded institutions that outlasted him. In 1818, he established the Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca (in modern Malaysia), which trained both Western missionaries to work in China and Chinese Christians to lead their own churches. He helped start the first Chinese-language newspaper and the first Chinese-language magazine.</p>

<h2>The Converts</h2>

<p>Twenty-seven years of missionary work in China. Ten converts baptized.</p>

<p>By any worldly measure, this seems like a pathetic return on investment. Morrison worked for nearly three decades in conditions of constant danger and deprivation, and he won fewer souls than a mediocre revivalist might claim in a single evening.</p>

<p>But those ten converts matter more than the number suggests. One of them was Cai Gao, who in 1814 became the first Chinese person baptized by a Protestant missionary. Another was Liang Fa, who became the first ordained Chinese Protestant minister and later wrote a tract called "Good Words to Admonish the Age" that would have world-historical consequences.</p>

<p>In the 1830s, a young man named Hong Xiuquan failed the imperial civil service examinations for the third time. Devastated, he fell into a fevered illness during which he experienced strange visions. Years later, he read Liang Fa's tract and became convinced that his visions were genuine divine revelations—that he was, in fact, the younger brother of Jesus Christ, sent to establish a heavenly kingdom on earth.</p>

<p>Hong Xiuquan went on to lead the Taiping Rebellion, one of the deadliest conflicts in human history. The civil war lasted from 1850 to 1864 and killed an estimated twenty to thirty million people—more than World War One.</p>

<p>This was not what Robert Morrison had in mind when he baptized Liang Fa. Religious ideas, once released into the world, travel in unpredictable directions.</p>

<h2>The Legacy</h2>

<p>Morrison's wife Mary died in 1821 after giving birth to their sixth child. He remarried in 1824 to Elizabeth Armstrong. He took only one furlough home to England during his entire career, from 1824 to 1826, during which he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society—one of the highest honors in British science—for his contributions to the study of China.</p>

<p>He returned to Canton and worked until his health finally gave out. Robert Morrison died on August 1, 1834, at the age of fifty-two. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Macau, where his tombstone still stands.</p>

<p>The missionaries who came after him—Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission; Peter Parker, the first medical missionary to China; a small army of translators, doctors, teachers, and preachers—all walked through doors that Morrison had opened. His dictionary and Bible translation remained standard tools for decades. The Anglo-Chinese College trained generations of missionaries and Chinese church leaders.</p>

<p>When Morrison arrived in China, there were zero Protestant Christians in the entire country. When he died, there were perhaps a few hundred. Today, estimates of Chinese Christians range from sixty million to over a hundred million, depending on how you count—making China home to one of the largest Christian populations on earth.</p>

<p>Morrison would probably have been uncomfortable with any attempt to credit him for this outcome. He was, by all accounts, a modest man who considered himself unworthy of the work he had been given. When asked if he expected to make an impact on China, he deflected the question entirely.</p>

<p>"No sir, but I expect God will."</p>
