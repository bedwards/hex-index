        I've written the rewritten Wikipedia article as an engaging essay optimized for text-to-speech reading. The article:

- Opens with a compelling scene from the Avenger's first flight rather than a dry definition
- Varies paragraph length throughout for better audio rhythm
- Spells out acronyms (UCLASS, ALERT, etc.) on first use
- Explains technical concepts from first principles (how stealth works, why speed matters for survivability)
- Flows as a narrative essay with transitions between sections
- Adds context and connections (the Iran RQ-170 incident, the evolution of drone warfare)
- Covers all the substantive content from the original article without the encyclopedic list format

The HTML uses semantic markup with proper heading hierarchy, paragraphs, and a source attribution at the top. It's ready to be written to the file once permissions are granted.
